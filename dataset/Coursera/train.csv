Unprecedented high speaking speed.,0
This course states that it is for people with no knowledge in SAS. I had to go online elsewhere to learn SAS before completing this course. There are free SAS tutorials on the SAS webpage - I highly recommend completing them before trying this course.,0
"I was really disappointed with this course, especially considering how great the first course was. IMO...there was too large of a jump between the two courses, and the plethora of ""I'm totally lost..."" threads in the forums would seem to back up my opinion. I'm currently reading Head First Android Development and it is exactly what I needed to grasp basic concepts as well get my bearings in the Android world. If this class remains the same I wouldn't be surprised to see attendance drop in further courses and/or Coursera starts receiving complaints about the difficulty.",0
doesn't show the videos.,0
"This is the specialisation that sucks all joy out of the entire course. 6 month on and I am still on week 2. The software and the provided files are not fully working, something is always missing, constant error messages... If you don't have background in statistics, you will have a very difficult time.",0
Course was taught by people who gave no indication they had ever bought a security. They read flatly from the teleprompter and rarely looked at their audience. Very disconcerting and not conducive to trusting what is being said.,0
"Poor context, no real examples. The guy just reads what is written on the slides without further explanations.",0
"Just garbage. This course and its twin ""Introduction to Smart IoT Devices"" are an expression of imposture at high level. Fortunately, the other courses in EIT Digital series are very interesting.",0
"Really bad course. Badly taught, strange choice of assignments and quiz questions. Unfortunately, I did the free trial and Coursera didn't process my cancellation so that I had to pay for a whole month for this.Complete waste of time AND(!!!) money!",0
"This is way too esoteric. The content was delivered way too fast for me to keep up and process it. This needs to be taught with more frequent hands on examples. I'm also not sure why, if auditing, we can't submit and see how we're doing on the learning. I have no way to evaluate if I'm picking up the concepts or not, which is a struggle. Overall, I would not recommend this course for R beginners. I would look elsewhere.",0
Need English Version Please,0
"The first few weeks are truly beginner/intro course stuff and the entire course is well taught. However, weeks 4-7 ramp up at far too fast of a pace. I spent 8-10 hours every week trying to keep up and it just moved too fast. The instructor was doing things at breakneck speed with little explanation. It gets very discouraging by the end because you simply can't play the material. I think this course is really for people who are re-learning guitar or already have musical backgrounds.",0
"It is very interesting, but we have to face problems with Teradata, I have not been able even to log in, and a lot of students are in the same situation, and the problem persists, even in the duedate of the test.",0
Very confused. So there is little point. Only vague news ... nothing substantial!,0
"The lesson is really boring , and the lecturer just reads the slides. And there is no any interaction on the slides, or explaining on the graphs and meaning of sentence. Just read it through. I am enough of this kind of lesson.",0
"Very low level , im sorry but this cant be even considered a good intro to HTML,CSS im going to stop wasting my time watching this.no chllange in the assignments or questions , + more of an overview of the basics then the basics ..",0
Not really useful ~ I would like to email in a PDF file of comments,0
"Not really well produced for the media. Too much instruction of the teacher, few practice instead.",0
Not what expected ...,0
"A list of research papers to read further that's it. The course is too short to cover the subject so it covers nothing in the end.The programming assignment have no help, whatsoever it's ""do it"" any language. The 2 programming assignment doesn't have much to do with the course. We don't even talk about the algo to use to do it. It looks like coursera has asked the professor to add a programming assignment to the course and he had 3 minutes to choose what it could be.It shouldn't be advertised in coursera as it is.Ah, forgot to mention that no one replies to the forums,actually no one uses them.I think the subject is very interesting but this course gives a really bad advertising to Coursera, the university and the professor.It needs more work before it's deployed on the platform.I am going to try another Coursera course in the same kind of subject I hope it won't be the same.",0
"No forum, what are you thinking!",0
"There is no instruction with this course. If you've never written a script before you're not going to get a lot of help here other than researching things yourself, which you can do without this course. Not to mention, the feedback is minimal and not all that helpful. For example. if i've never written a script, what value am I to someone else who has also never written a script. And what value is their feedback to me. I signed up to get some experience and to also get feedback from those more experienced than I. I'm less interested in what my peers have to say and more interested in the feedback of the instructor who has years more experience than most of us. To pass assignments off of 4 or 5 peer reviews is worthless. There's no value in that. What does the instructor think??? Would HE pass us? He occasionally drops a line in the discussion forum, but no direct feedback to the students.I think this class should have a cap on enrollment so that the instructor can actually review and provide feedback to the students. Joke's on anyone paying $49 to essentially teach yourself. This guys just sits back and ""moderates"" when he can.The best thing about this class is that it does force you to write, but beyond that, it's not helpful at all. Truly disappointing.",0
"Totally disorganized, mis-managed, unfairly graded course!",0
Submission is buggy and final assignment is confusing. Almost more than half of students failed this course because of it.,0
This specialization is delayed for months now - very annoying! Don't give them money!,0
This capstone is unavailable most part of the year. I paid in advance for the complete Digital Marketing Specialisation which is a 1 year subscription thinking I can complete the course anytime I want (that is how they advertise it). I finished all the theory well within the 2 months into my enrolment. When I came to the capstone project it was unavailable and for almost 3-4 months. When I contacted coursera.org they had no clue when it is going to start. I am a working professional and my schedule gets very busy when I am on projects. And ever since then whenever the capstone is available my schedule has been very busy. I have completed 2 Assignments in capstone and 4 to go and the 1 year subscription is over. Coursera.org says I have to pay for it again to continue which I am never willing to. There is no courtesy to a student/customer who has paid for the course. I have paid in full but I don't have the Digital Marketing Specialisation Certificate. This platform is more about money than education.,0
"I feel this course was severely misrepresented. This clearly not a beginner level class by any measurement. And the ""4-6 hours"" of expected student involvement is ridiculous. A beginner (NO programming experience) should expect to spend 15 to 20 hours on the first week alone and at least 10 hours for each of the remaining weeks.I have over 25 years of programming experience in Assembly language, Visual Basic, C and C++. I am clearly NOT at the beginner level yet I spent more than 11 hours on the first week, mostly due to trying to download and setup properly for the course. Also, there are over 3 hours of videos in the 1st week plus 3 quizzes and a programming assignment. If anyone spent less than 6 hours on week 1, then that was NOT the first time they took this class.I also am keenly disappointed in the restrictive nature of the assignments/quizzes. Having to type ""-1*1+11"" instead of ""-i+11"" (and you better not have any leading or lagging spaces!!) for instance.Bottom line, I would not recommend this course for anyone wanting to Learn Java for Android Programming unless you already know Java and just want some intro on Android development with Android Studio. And if you are indeed at the beginner level, do yourself a favor and start with introductory courses in Computer Science.",0
Very boring,0
"If you are a real beginner like me (having zero or little programming knowledge) and your time is limited, I think this course (or the specialisation) is not suitable for you. The assignments and quizzes are very time consuming. One week I spent literally 30+ hours writing and debugging codes for just one quiz.",0
I wasn't impressed...v few or new material,0
"Project description versus requirements were terrible, not sure if the new Coursera format played a role in the issues or not. Quite a few of the homework items require guessing as the answers don't align to the results of the latest tools they have you use. If the first class or three in the series was like this I wouldn't have taken the courses.",0
It would be better if the instructors cared to respond to queries.,0
Lectures are very boring and designed in a weird way. He is simply reading the book that he wrote and no real practice was ever done.,0
"Using a proprietary library instead of widely used libraries and discouraging the use of open source widely used libraries. It barely compiles, the example notebook has method calls that use non existing methods of the SFrame object.The course claims that it teaches the student how useful practical knowledge but then ends up using a non standard library and saying not to use pandas or scikit learn.",0
Speed is very fast for a basic level student. The data explanation and correlation demonstrated is not clear.,0
Too much emphasis on taking tests versus actually programming.,0
The instructors overly explain simple concepts and talk about programming inbetween makes the course confusing then you get lost and quiz you on stuff that was not properly explaiuned,0
You need to have deep knowledge in matlab to get pass the assignments. I have spent more time figuring out how the simulations are implemented that really learning about the target algorithm to implement.,0
Dearth of any specific / practical tools.,0
"Very poorly presented course. Despite having completed quite a number of coursera courses before, and even being already familiar with a good deal of the preliminary material in this one, i soon abandoned it due to the inadequate and scrappily prepared presentation of material. Mercedes Paniccia in particular speaks in a virtually unintelligible expressionless monotone with no explanation or elaboration to relieve what amounts to little more than a list of definitions and bald statements such as can be found in the glossary section of many textbooks. I would strongly recommend finding an alternative course devoted to the subject or maybe seeking out a readable textbook.",0
Misleading course name/title. Was expecting a course on using Excel. Forums were cluttered and not monitored often.,0
The least comprehensive course I ever took. It needs very good prerequisite about computer vision. And the demostration was very poor.,0
I do not like the Course. Too difficult for me. Slides are too full of written lines that professor Navarro simply reads.,0
The preceding courses were interesting and helpful. This capstone project lacked substance. The project did not allow itself to apply many of the concepts learned throughout the course. It's almost exclusively about customer analytics. I would not be surprised if Yahoo! worked with Wharton and Coursera to launch this course in order to crowd-source ideas on how to turn around the company.,0
This specialization is delayed for months now - very annoying! Don't give them money!,0
Shame that it was not possible to progress with this course without using graphlab which the creator of this course himself created. Please see the course as just a training sales promotion for his ML application.,0
The Capstone project has been getting delayed since JanDont expect yourself to complete the specialization,0
"It uses mixed material from other platforms meant for pure Python programming learning, jumps between sections in the external platform going forward and back so its pretty confusing to find problems involving content that you have no chance to know if you do not have previous experience with python. I would not recommend this course for beginners in programming.",0
"While the lectures were a little slow about providing information, they were entertaining.But I feel very mislead about the costs. The lecturer repeated over and over how everything is free but, in the end, only the first course in the series is free. Then you must pay a monthly fee in order to go on.I would not have continued with the first course if I'd known that was all there was going to be.",0
"Its ok. HTML is not ""Code"" its a Mark-Up Language. When she cant explain sheo covers it up with attitude words or skips quickly.",0
"Boring voice. A lot of overcomplicated terms, where you can describe your idea in a much more simple way. In result i feel that lector read this material not to teach people, but just to read it. Disgusting.",0
79 USD? just to be able to submit peer-graded assignments... talk about greed,0
"I would not recommend this course for a few reasons:1. There are no course notes accompanying the video lectures. Transcripts of the lectures in unformatted text files and a glossary are available for download. I really canât figure why the instructor doesnât provide an outline of what key concepts he wants us to learn from each lecture. Also, Iâm surprised that Coursera doesn't require a basic set of learning tools for a paid class, such as lecture notes or an outline. This might be a good class for you if learn well from videos.2. The quizzes contain ambiguously written questions for no good reason.3. Two weeks in and there is little substance. For example, week 2 includes a few Skype videos of the professor interviewing former students from a Duke Masterâs program. They seemed like very intelligent and nice people but the content of the videos offered little value (i.e., nothing new) to someone already working in corporate IT.",0
"Extremely repetitive with little to no visual interest. Needs to be cut down to about one tenth the presentation time. There are no visual representations, no exercises and no interactivity.This is the most repetitive MOOC I have ever taken and I've taken a great many.",0
"This is a bait and switch. You must purchase the course even though parts are free, it's really not.",0
"This course is very difficult to follow, not because the topics are hard or too technical but mostly due to lecturer's poor job in explaining and creating a narrative.",0
"I have met with nothing but frustration with this course. Though the lectures are understandable, but the readings are comparable but unrelated to the material in the lectures. I also had no kind of communication with instructors, TAs, or other student for help. It is ridiculous that there is NO feedback forums, and this seems to be the only course that handles it that way. If this an institutional decision to not have feedback, it seems that these instructors and/or the University of California, Irvine do not care to help students. I would not recommend this to anyone!",0
Not enough detail and information provided in the lectures to undertake the final assessment.,0
"Huge gap between videos and final assignment.Videos should be edited, we are not interested in trials and errors of the instructors.",0
He teaches even worse then me. This course has no practical example. It's just introduction(from start to end).When I enrolled in this course I was expecting that at the end of this course I will be able to develop an app or anything like that. But know I think that I have just wasted my time.,0
"The professor did not Interact with people, I was wiling to see some discussions and contributions among people",0
"Hard to follow, ideas are not organized and are not well presented. Lecturer has many pauses, that even on increased playback speed (x1.25), are still distracting. Do not recommend!",0
"I had very high hopes for this course. I was actually planning to purchase the specialization - just as a thank you gesture. Unfortunately, there is very little to be grateful for here.In this course, you get a series of super short lectures giving you an overview of the math and physics behind the aerial robotics. I can't be the judge (since I hold a degree in this area), but I don't think you'll be able to get much if you aren't familiar with the topics yet. And you most certainly won't learn anything new if you had some previous training.And then suddenly there are assignments. That have almost nothing to do with the lectures, but require quite a bit of Matlab programming (did I mention you won't be taught any Matlab in the process?) To make things worse, the assignments are rather poorly explained.By the way, you won't get any replies from the course team - they even ignore questions about errors in lectures.The course looks very sloppy. As if someone forced the team to put together something for Coursera. A huge disappointment :(",0
waste of time,0
"Could not follow very easily. Confused, gained nothing from the lectures. Really no substance to it.",0
Poor help with instructions. Was trying to install to Linux while reading the video screen as there is little documentation or any actual explanation as to what you're doing. Got to a part where a command on my terminal wouldn't work and given I have no idea how it works to begin with I couldn't debug the issue.Also as a general review of the little of the course I did it's generally considered poor form to just read back what the viewer can see on the screen already when doing presentations. Was disappointed with this course.,0
"Rather theoretical introduction to the basics of an interesting subject. Regretfully examples and assignments are frequently overly complex in areas which are unrelated to the subject. In addition, people who work with software development should expect to look further if they aim to add to their toolbox.",0
"The lectures are very well-organized. The topics are also cover in this field. However, the lectures are very dry and boring. The main professor were reading the scripts on the monitor. From my perspective, with his knowledge in this field as being described on his personal web site, he should be able to talk comfortably by looking at the topic on the slide then discuss about it in detail. I would suggest to change the environment to be at the wide open space, like coffee shop, to make this course more attractive. I'm sorry, it is not what I expected.",0
"Videos and materials are fine, but insufficient for the quizzes, which are apparently very difficult even for PhDs in the field.",0
the videos are too longassignments are difficultand dr asfahani is not like dr larryi loved dr larry much moredr asfahani is not interesting in his presentations at all,0
"so i will give one star because the title is misleading. I was expecting a course about responsive UI for website. But is yet again a basic introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.",0
"Despite the arguments of this module are extremely interesting and very useful for Robotics, I think the way they are treated is very poor.In my opinion lectures are so superficial that it is almost a waste of time to follow them.Lectures are completely useless and most of the time quizzes are note related with them.In order to solve quizzes you have not only to recover prior knowledge, that it is obvious, but also to search for new arguments somwhere in the web, in some other courses where contents are better treated and explained. In that contest what are the quizzes, what should quizzes have to test if no content is given?Moreover it often happen that without a clear support from the lectures, questions are confused and ambiguous. It is quite difficult to follow the teaching path and to enrich my knowledge.I think it is a very bad way to make a course and often the pleasure to follow disappears leaving a sense of frustration and futility.I arrived at the end of the course just because I'm doing the specialization otherwise I would have left in the middle of the first week.I'm very disappointed.",0
This course is not relevant in the real world.,0
"I was expecting something else, very basic information.",0
This course is really bad. The instruction is not enough to solve the programming assignment. The almost contents aren't related to communicating data science result.,0
"Course could have earn my stars.Money, money, money is not the way to go.",0
bad instructor,0
Only catered to the American healthcare system. This course was not mind numbingly boring as hell,0
"animations, animations and animations...",0
The worst! I don't recommend you to take any course from this institute. It is just wasting time and money.,0
"This was really disappointing.There is almost no connection between the experience of the lectures (and that's all the videos are - lectures that track a PowerPoint presentation) and the assignments, quizzes, etc. Reference and source materials are frequently mentioned in passing, but there is no comprehensive list of works cited anywhere. The assignments are often vaguely described and, in more than one case, were described entirely differently in different places.I have nothing good to say about this experience. You're watching a fundamentally disconnected series of mostly ad-hoc discussions of vague concepts. A simple list of books to read would be much more valuable.This is by far the worst MOOC I've taken, from any source, in any discipline. The fact that it actually costs money simply adds to the pain.",0
Disorganized.,0
"Did not like the course, complicated concepts and poor representation. ( i still really really appreciate the efforts of those who put it together with their hard work)",0
"This course is garbage. The instruction videos are fine, but the assignments are imprecise in their language at times, and there are certain key points needed to complete them that aren't covered in the videos. The mentor in the forums is lousy, and his responses are worded as if he's talking with a peer and not a beginner/student.I may or may not try another coursera course after this. But if this experience is any indication, Coursera isn't very good. The same UofM course appears over on Udemy, and I wonder if it is just being repurposed on as many platforms as possible without the care needed to make sure it works.",0
"In my opinion:The topics reviewed were too haphazardly selected.The citations for quoted research were hard to impossible to find,The course focused disproportionately on the lecturer's commercial ventures.",0
if you do not have a background in statistics do not expect to pass this course,0
This is a joke right?5 minutes long videos with questions after it shall teach me effective?!you guys are ridiculous!,0
"difficulf...very difficult, guys",0
"Personally, I strongly doubt that putting a bunch of slides and a few auto-graded exercises is the best way to learn about logic. Why then Stanford University doesn't just email his students this material and let them work on their own instead of doing lectures?I don't see the added value at all. Apart from being able to discuss the topic in the forum with other online students, what's the advantage in comparison to buying a book and doing the exercises there?This course to me started off with the wrong foot. No info on the starting date of the course until the end of September, when instead the course was supposed to start at the beginning of the month. And now the complete absence of videos. This to me seems more like a fuck up on the side of Coursera, which didn't find an agreement with Stanford University so no material had been produced until now. Then, in order not to completely ruin its reputation, Coursera put a bunch of slides calling it an online course and expecting people to buy this lie.I might be wrong and this could be only my theory and nothing else, however, I won't recommend Coursera to anyone after this. Very bad feedback so far, and the funny thing is that I had big expectations before the start.Hope this will be taken as constructive feedback and not as a complaint.",0
"No option of completing the course without paying. So why do you call your site FREE online courses? And why do we have to go into the trouble of attending the class and watching the videos, and reading the material without being capable of at least watching our results in assignments?",0
"Really dreadful: absurdly fast progress, with really dry graphics, where they cover the history of economics in about 30 minutes! To make things worse, the lecturer (who doesn't appear in the videos) speaks incredibly fast, while graphs and bullet point lists fly by on the screen. There's not time to process the information and complicated terms and processes are explained in just a few seconds.I'm disappointed as it looked like an interesting course but doesn't live up to some of the really great courses available which employ great teaching and delivery.",0
"A lot of theoretical stuff, nothing for practice; awful final exam strategy, the course encourages learning by heart without any thinking; advice: to help non english students (like me), make the lectures not overlapping the subtitles",0
"Sorry, the guy in the first video doesn't blink, which is very weird. The second video was so incredibly dry and boring that I completely lost interest. I know this could be a fascinating course with the proper videos and visuals to help people understand it.",0
I'm not able to submit my assignments,0
"Course work was entirely optional and only started at the end of week 2. The required level of involvement was too low to be helpful. I don't learn well just watching lectures - I can get that much from YouTube!!! However, I expect a bit more when paying $500 for a specialisation.The first module in the series was too basic but at least there was a lot of coding involved. This (second) module didn't even have that.",0
"The EEPROM project in week 3 is undoable with the specified simulator, as the simulator is simply not functional. I tested different computers, windows and mac operating systems, different browsers, different security settings, etc. Nothing works. The assignment is also way beyond the level of an introductory course. In addition, the complete lack of discussion forums attached to the course suggests that it is preferable to shut off discussion than to address the problems. Speaking of which, a search of the general forums indicate that this has been an ongoing issue since the latter half of 2015. Seriously, what the hell? Many people don't have a ton of extra money to throw away on garbage, and you are selling a defective product.",0
Not a course that helps you solve wicked problems which do not have solutions that will come suddenly one fine day and ones that require more thought effort and brainstorming.,0
"Very knowledgeable professors, but very little explanation or actual 'teaching'. Graded assignments require a lot of self-education.",0
"Concepts are fantastic but the material developed to deliver the course is short of expectations, especially from a university. Excel sheets do not match what is demonstrated in video lectures, lots of confusion around how to complete tasks, quiz answer options not being correct, and missing Excel spreadsheets (e.g. video lecture says to refer to accompanying excel spreadsheet, but no spreadsheet available). Also, judging from past discussions by students, some inconsistencies around formulas being presented in video lectures versus assignment questions. could have been a great course, but the inconsistencies have made is very disappointing.",0
Peer to peer assignments are really slow and due time dependent.,0
"Course 1 was really enriching, but this second stage didn't achieve the level that it's supposed, videos should be remake in order to connect with learners, materials should be upgrade to fulfill expectations.",0
"The course presents lots of concepts and papers, but it doesn't really seems applicable in reality.It felt too ""fluffy"" and subjective to me.",0
"Difficult to understand, not a good explainer.",0
Very broad instruction but very picky quizzes. Spent more time frustrated with trick questions on quizzes than actually learning something.,0
Coursera lost my thoughtful 2-star review so I am replacing it with this. I learned a lot through my own efforts and through the efforts of students who bothered to post in the forums. The one mentor disappeared half-way through the course.,0
"Not very helpful for those with a solid statistical background. I prefer to use R to do the modeling things, while this course should talk more about pivot tables and existing useful financial functions which advantage over other statistical tools.",0
"I'd like to give just one star rating for this course, as it is very far from what I expected. The course expect students to know Python, to know R, but did not go deep enough to help students understand the insight from social media data. In fact, lots of R task can be replaced with Python, so the course could be designed in a much better way that students do not always switch between two programming environments. This course mainly teaches how to download data with keywords, and how to plot graph, not worth the effort of learning. Therefore, I would not recommend this course to anyone.",0
Stunning waste of time. There is nothing of substance.,0
"In my opinion, this course is a waste of time, it simply throws a bunch of links and terminology for you to google and research. The project is interesting but once again, you have to do tons of research and take up other courses to fill the gaps (might as well do the other courses instead of this one).I do not recommend this course or the specialization.",0
There is no subtitles in English for the video lectures and the slides are in Chinese.,0
This course was uninspiring,0
"This class assumes a lot of statistical knowledge and background that is not covered in the first three classes of the series. So much statistical terminology and jargon was used by the instructor, it felt like taking a class in another language where I had to constantly stop the video and google for the terminology she used. It took a lot of grit to finish the class, which was overall a very demoralizing and negative experience.",0
"not too good ,,because in assignments session they doesnt know what the right ans is, as in first assignment ,the ques is about circumference of circle as in google the exact ans is what they wronged it",0
The instructor rambled on when back on forth on topics and numbers too much and made the videos much longer than they needed to be. Some of the information is badly outdated like the electric vehicle driving range and hybrid vehicles only able to drive a mile with ou,0
"I should suggest my fellow Coursera students not to waste their money and time for this course. You'll learn a lot more than this course has to offer if you consult some websites with screenwriting tutorial blogs, read books and write on your own.I am a PhD student of theoretical film studies and and a fan of Coursera courses. I was eager to learn screenwriting as an interesting hands-on course. Well, it's project-based alright, but where's the real guidance??This is a lazily designed course with poor content and almost zero guidance. The videos are very short and feels like a layman is trying to motivate you to write something, that's all. No methods explained other than some terminologies like bible, acts, outline being thrown at you. No examples, no comparisons, no detailed approaches.Lastly, scriptwriting has a significant difference with other humanities course. Being peer-reviewed doesn't help here -- a total novice can not effectively judge another newbie's work nor give them quality feedback.",0
"Course title is misleading. It is actually a course on Managing Agile Software development, not Product management.There is common understanding in active product management community that major focus for product manager is market. Market is not mentioned in this course at all.What requirements and schedule, guys??? Current product management is all about hypotheses, A/B testing, customer development, experiments, lean UX, etc.You completely missing the point.Still, this course can be a good one for those who want to start Managing agile software development.",0
"Really bad course. They don't explain the concepts clearly, the quizzes ambiguously ask things not seen in the videos and the instructor introduces equations without further explanation. The course Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots (edX) is much better.",0
The course is very superficial in nature and there is no difficulty...,0
"It is impossible to input solutions to quizzes/exams - even when they are correct, they are graded as wrong - a massive waste of time",0
Not much here,0
"Very bad course too fast is not an introduction more like a remember of things, this course try to covers too much information in 3 weeks and the assigments are not well guided and messy",0
Very poor explanation and very complicated topics.,0
too hard in practice,0
"The material itself isn't bad, but the course instructors never respond to questions. What's the point of the class if I can't get my questions answered?",0
"Verbose, wandering. Instructor takes too long to do too little. No value add over a textbook.",0
Poor feedback and advice with those who really do not know of programming. To shame!,0
"The first segment on why ""Digital Changes Everything"" is good background but the rest was too abstract for me with nothing I could really take away and practice.",0
"The course is basically an advertisement for the software one of the teachers created. I did learn a bit of high level concepts, but when it comes to coding, the answers is always 'conveniently, my software does this for you'. I wanted to actually learn about these concepts deeper, and implement them.I also was able to complete this 6 week paid course in a few days which should not be possible. I have since started the free Stanford course taught by a co-founder of coursera, and it is MUCH better! I recommend it to anyone!",0
Didn't learn anything new. Too much of chit chat.,0
"Awful course. The lectures IN NO WAY prepare you for the final assignment which is supposed to take two hours. The ""course"" consists of really boring videos of the instructor using Galaxy and in no way teaches you anything about using Galaxy or how it works. The lectures and quizzes are a joke. You can pass the quizzes just by watching the videos. I got to the final assignment and had no clue what to do if you. I know nothing about bioinformatics, or NGS (which is why I took and paid for this stupid course) so I spent WEEKS on the final assignment and I STILL could not finish or pass the course. Whoever allows this course to still exist and waste people's time and take their money should be ASHAMED of themselves. Read the discussion forums and you'll see what I'm talking abut. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE.",0
"repetitive content with other MOMA courses (modern art&idea)?? duh, not gonna pay $50 for this. :(",0
"I understand it is a technical subject but going slide after slide reading the material without any clear explanation, is not learning is just reciting.It would have been better to try and put only half of the facts (we can always search for specific flag) and explain more about use cases.There has to be a better way to pass the materials.",0
Totally not what I expected. Most of it was concerned with mathematical problems.,0
The use of external tool for no good reason + the lack of written summary makes the course really hard to follow.,0
Too short to get any depth of information. Too expensive for the content provided.,0
The teacher is boring,0
"only theory no practice. I don't need math at this point as I don't know even how to build simple machine learning program. Programming assignments come with no explanation. It is not possible to finish this course without learning from other sources on the web, materials attached to this course are not enough to understand the subject. I have trouble understanding what the teacher is trying to teach from the very beginning of course.",0
"Really basic spreadsheet knowledge, not to be recommanded for anybody who is already familiar with Excel.",0
"I thought this was poor. It was basically a re-hash of the previous module with slightly different tasks. Given that I had to wait three months for the capstone to be ready, I found it a bit rich that my deadline to finish it was a couple of weeks! Don't waste your money/time on this particular module.",0
very basic course. I would only recommend this if you are just starting your PhD program and you have no idea how the writing process works,0
"Total disaster. I payed 315euro for this course. Course started on 24/10/2016. I faced with technical difficulties till this weekend. I reported this problem already many times.. Finally this weekend the Jupiter notebook worked and I started the first assignment. I spent many hours but still couldn't get solve the assignment. I read discussions, write post.. Searched on Google.. Read lots of document. I still couldn't get what the correct answer is the assignment wants. I realized that it is impossible to pass this exam. In the lectures they don't mention anything which will help you to solve this time consuming assignment by the way.. After having this terrible course experience this weekend, today (14/11/2016) I decided to apply for refund. But guess what I says 14 days have passed so I cannot get refund!!!! Now I payyed 315 euro for nothing but disappointment!!!!",0
"The course is very interesting but there is a problem with the quizzes, it doesn't accept correct questions. If needed I can provide a screen shot of the problem in one of the quizzes. Hope that all this will be fixed and I'll be able to take the course again.",0
Easy but really complicate to submit the assignment.,0
"I'm sorry, but I have taken many courses on Coursera and this is, without a doubt, the absolute worst. This isn't minimal teaching, it's practically nonexistent. Frankly, buying a book would at least give more guidance than tossing one-minute 'lectures' out there and having students blindly fend for themselves under the guise of ""experimental learning"".Plus, you then have an all or nothing grade system - there is no middle ground, just pass or fail on an assignment that had little to no instruction or examples listed to begin with.I'm truly surprised that Coursera agreed to allow this course as it is. I suggest that the instructor and team see how other instructors at universities are teaching their Coursera courses. Just because something is free, it doesn't give free reign to be lazy. If I had paid for it, I would have asked for a refund. This entire course needs a serious revamp.",0
"way too slow and too long ; too many digressions, by-side remarks, lessons of life, etc ... go straight to the point.",0
"Very scattered and long lessons. Very difficult to learn something that is not ""textual"". Examination is based on literal terms (e.g: what year was XX reform enacted""). Not the type of knowledge I thought I would get",0
just reading the materials,0
I could not understand instructor. Using subtitles didn't help either as many words came up unintelligible.,0
"besides the major technical issues and lack of information before the postponed start of the course and minor technical issues, the way of teaching is well adapted to on-site classes where you can sit in study groups solving the problems together; the given examples have partly little relevance and do not help to solve the assignments and according to the staff the best way to solve assignments is by using google (or stackoverflow or whatever) - really?! somehow it seems they just took an on-site course, played with some fancy technical solutions and call it now a MOOC... they seem not really aware of the fact that on-site teaching and MOOCs require completely different types of pedagogic methodsamazing how the same university can offer both the best MOOC (Dr. Chuck's) and one of the worst (this one)",0
I wish I had paid closer attention to the refund policy. The production quality and content did not meet my expectations.,0
"I've started the course and i have found ""learn to program"" part, but where is ""quality code""?",0
NLP is a total different thing and should be a course by itself. I would prefer a a large scale machine learning capstone where we could make models and it would fit better to real life situation! Through all the courses I worked hard only to reach NLP capstone? this doesn't feel right! Please fix it!,0
Do not take this course unless you have previous C# coding experience. It is most definitely not for beginners.,0
"I don't recommend this class. Jogesh K. Muppala has very labored English and his pace and verbosity make the lectures hard to get through. I've turned in around 10 assignments and have yet to get a grade on anything. The course content is poorly organized and executed. Peer grading is just dumb (and clearly doesn't work, since I have yet to get a single assignment back). When you turn in assignment files, they cannot be opened (and we found out from an apparent student how to get past the technical issues). Questions about the class and submitting assignments went unanswered. My advice, save your money and don't take this class.",0
Quizzes and assignments cannot be submitted if course is audited.,0
"Took the first two courses which were fine but this one started off poorly and just got worse, unfortunately. I'm wondering if I can get my money back.",0
not all apps wok on my devices so I was unable to do assignment. Apple Annie was difficult,0
Not a very informative course. A few hours' worth of reading up specs that I can also find on Wikipedia.,0
It is tottaly unacceptable to have to pay to pass quizz !!!I cancel my participation,0
"Contrary to what is being billed here, all the concepts here are from the more traditional school of marketing. The way the 4Ps are explained and applied (through barely) related to consumer products that are retailed. Digital marketing has barely made a dent in their revenues.Technology products don't follow this model.Another annoying aspect of this course is that things are not well defined so they can't be applied. ""customer co-creation"" is presented as a ground breaking idea but it is defined so vaguely. The definition states that customer co-creation is any contribution by a customer or otherwise that helps shape the products. What is considered contribution? Is product feedback contribution? If so, this idea is as old as a Bazaar. Or does the customer actually have to do creative work, in the case of Threadless.The big problem with this course is that it does not introduce the student to any new mental frameworks, leave alone anything practical. This course is a prime example of academiaitis - ideas created in ivory towers without any practical input or use.",0
"The final assignment is impossible to finish since I have 10.4 version in my computer. You, as the course provider, should modify the assignment instead of asking the student to make changes. The point is that we are trying to gain some knowledge, not wasting time on solving those bugs.",0
"I'm honestly quite pissed. The material itself is fine but I have had a terrible experience working with the instructors. I don't think I will continue taking these courses.I don't appreciate the amount of time and effort given into the programming assignments only to receive practically zero help. First of all, I don't know WHY I'm failing the test cases, I just am. Your program runs through maybe 100 tests to ensure correctness but somehow the instructors decide you should only see the first 3. But then, I try posting on the forums to receive help only to have it removed. Quite frankly, I have spent well over 10 hours at this point on a single problem and I've created my own tests and I have looked at all the very vague hints given in the forums and I still have no clue what to do. I have school, a job, and yet I'm losing all this productivity because I'm running all these damn tests hoping on the off-chance that I catch whatever weird bug it is that's failing my code. All I want is real, concrete feedback.",0
The most boring course ever. I just couldn't go beyond the first day,0
The course is just terrible.It leaves an impression of being unfinished. There's a lot of knowledge missed out from lectures while being expected from the student in the quizzes.Lecturers themselves have a very vague understanding of how java works and how to code in real life. What they say in some lectures is very misleading and gives either false or just insufficient understanding of certain mechanisms.The examples are overcomplicated. They demand a full concentration on domain knowledge rather than on programming itself.,0
"I found the wording of the assignments really difficult to follow so I didn't really understand what was expected of me. I spend a lot of time (and therefore money!) on this course but in the end I made a conscious decision to stop. I was taking it for personal pleasure and it was not worth the stress each week of trying to work out what was being asked. I have taken a number of other courses in creative writing elsewhere, and other courses on Coursera - this is the first one I have actively chosen to stop because I just wasn't engaging with it - either for education or for enjoyment.",0
"In fact, this is an inconsistent attempt of re-implementing previous FRP course from the same authors. FRP course had many issues about homework/lectures being poorly related, this one is even worse. This is very frustrating, as a topic itself is one of the most interesting ones in today's software engineering.",0
"I am running Firefox v50 on Ubuntu Linux v16.04. I was unable to watch any of the lecture videos due to the page reloading every 2 - 10 seconds. I tried moving to a different video with the same results. I don't know if this is UC Davis-specific or whether Coursera has changed significantly since the last time I took a class, but this course is totally unusable.I would have left this review with Coursera rather than as a course review, but Coursera doesn't make contact information easy to locate.",0
"The guy is full of shit. He's just trying to sell you his book and his online game product. He was also obsessed with bragging about all of his accomplishments. I was quite disgusted by him at the end. I paid for the certification, but now I want my money back.",0
"Disappointed with lectures-structured data rather than real life examples-professor is speaking monotonously, without passion-no visualisation on the discussed topic",0
"Poor content, only a book accompanies the videos and we should not be forced to buy anything!",0
"The concept of the course is excellent--short videos, quizzes, activity. The execution is extremely poor--the short quizzes often do not emphasize the elements focused upon in the video OR ask questions addressed in the next video (not the one just viewed) OR address issues that are not raised at all in this particular course (but issues from other courses in the specialization). One is penalized for being late with assignments and must shift to a new session if one is late. The weekly tests are absolutely ridiculous--they ask questions requiring the application of concepts which were barely covered, concepts which were not reviewed, or which require real world knowledge which cannot be assumed for someone who has no experience in this field.",0
"This is my first course in coursera.Cons:Information redundancy, unnecessary required reading.Extend some information that only need few hours to study to a 6 weeks courses.Pros:There are some useful basic concepts & frames",0
Instructor doesn't seem to be passionate about giving the lecture,0
"Errors and glitches in the first two quizes that aren't fixed ('Don't worry, be happy, it's just a formating error, ignore the literal text displayed and just use your imagination to interpret what we thought we meant to say') have left me too unimpressed to spend more time wondering if I need to debug my code or debug their quizes.There are many other resources for learning python out there, and some of them take pedagogy seriously. Not, it seems, this one.",0
This is just because of the unclarity of the final assignment.,0
I felt more like I was part of some experiment to see how long I could tolerate boredom than that I was in class where someone was trying to share knowledge with me. Needless to say I did not make it to the end which is sad because I was genuinely interested in the content. The instructor's delivery was absolutely monotone and he did not seem to emphasize the key points in any way so I found it very difficult to retain any information or to even stay awake at times.,0
"By far to expansive for what you get. Anyway, thanks for the hint about swirl.",0
"This course is structured around a specific and costly Python library called Dato. It is possible to do the homework without it, but it is EXTREMELY difficult to do so. If the course wasn't structured around using Dato, it would be a lot simpler and a easier to complete the assignments. Also, a lot of the mathematical notation was written in a kind of psuedo Python code that made things confusing sometimes.",0
I suppose that we should have some basic knowledge of data visualization before this course. There are no practical sessions. I could not understand many topics and it seems that content has been missing from this course.,0
"The course is too complicated. Also this programm isnt working as good as it should. I got so many failures, which I had to look for by myself. Also it isnt well explained! I almost didnt understand anything! Also some data persons, i knew, didn't understand that either. They never worked with something like that!",0
This course hardly has any new content and a lot of it is also repeat from previous courses.,0
I really did not understand this course. There was way too much jargon.,0
"Might be good for someone looking for a casual overview?I really wanted to like this course, and was excited about the series. Very disappointing. Refunded after scoring 100% on first three weeks and watching the theory portion of week 4. I was familiar, with the subject prior to taking this course; was hoping for a deep dive.Too many trivially short and low information density videos. Handwavy mathematics. I would have liked to get a more solid idea of the depth of the series from the first course before committing money.Default software for the course has near-zero market penetration (per indeed.com), unless maybe you work at Apple -- not really excusable for something that purports real-world value. Yes, you can use other software, *except for the capstone*, per another reviewer: this is fatal.Presenters just not fully prepared to lecture on the topic: the nail in the coffin was the end of the week 4 lectures on clustering: ""So, at this point, you really should be able to go out there and build a really cool retrieval system for doing news article retrieval. Or any other really, really, really cool retrieval that I can't think of right now. But of course there's lots of interesting examples. So go out there and think of ideas that I can't think of right now."" Really? How about: ""Cut! Take two.""Many poor design choices for the presentation. Too much time spent writing things on slides that should have already been on the slides.As of this review: no reviews on the last courses in the series, and some poor (but indicative) reviews of the other courses.",0
"I am giving 1 star to this MOOC because giving 0 is not an option.The ""savoir relier protocol"" might be efficient when taught face to face in a classroom but as a MOOC it is a massive waste of time and money (I paid for the capstone project and I'm feeling robbed).I learnt absolutely nothing.This MOOC is a major disappointment from a school such as HEC.",0
not a good course,0
"This course has nothing to do with ""emerging technologies."" The course is essentially a quick history of Android and iOS smartphones that could be learned by browsing Wikipedia.",0
Poor alignment between assignments and lectures. Lots of content poorly explained.,0
"It's unbelievable is how many way you can rephrase the same idea over and over again, without making any progress in something new.",0
This class was not useful for me. The professor talked about the idea of data analysis without ever discussing how to actually perform data analysis.,0
"Very interesting, but I was really hoping more. For example, the professor does not teah us directly, like all the other courses on Coursera. It is only texts and archive videos.....Youtube would have done the same. Disappointed.",0
"This course is the least content rich of the series, so far. Seemed basic to me, but maybe that's because my background is communication and content strategy.",0
"Poor presentation skills (mostly reading slides)Unclear and inconsistent in what pre-requisite knowledge is needed for the course (in one place he assumes one does not know digital logic, but then later he assumes you know hardware languages, fpga design, etc.).Was a waste of time, shame on Coursera that pre-requisite knowledge was removed from the site.",0
"Course has not been updated. Wrong answers in quiz (eg week 3 quiz on progressivity), videos getting blocked at review question point, etc. I am checking out.",0
"Content very light, near of empty course.",0
"This was very disappointing, especially considering it's a Wharton product. The ""course"" was little more than an afternoon's worth of seminars. Since I am not a paying participant, I could not take the quizzes, so I finished watching the videos in less than a day.In addition, there are NO collateral or supporting materials provided. None of the spreadsheets or workbooks illustrated in the videos are available anywhere on the course site, despite their being advertised in the videos. All in all, it was consistent with the first course in this ""specialization"".Again, very disappointing. I'm glad I didn't spend any money on this.",0
"The entirety of this course is ""watch and listen"". There are no hands-on activities/assignments that get you implementing what you are (supposedly) learning. The assignments that are offered are optional and consist of filling in the blank code without actually providing you a way to see how your code works in the big picture.For example - they go on and on about how intents are complicated and tricky, but they don't actually give you a required assignment. It's optional. Then the actual assignment is ""Do this here, and this here, and then this here"" and only when you have completed every step can you actually run the code. But this doesn't actually show you how to build the intent. All you did was write down what they told you to and where. You never actually build anything yourself. You don't actually get an idea of how these things work or how to implement them yourself from scratch.The quizzes are also pointless. Every quiz is multiple choice, select all that apply. There's no thought required, just regurgitation of info from the lectures.Also, the entire week 1 lectures are HORRIBLE. The lectures on git are sssoooo dull that I could not stay awake no matter how much I wanted to. They are given in a monotone, bored tone that will drive you insane.Overall, this course seems more like it was hastily slapped together, without much thought, and then never looked at again. I would not recommend anyone take this course, let alone pay for it.",0
"They push the University of Maryland way too much, the book and the videos have much of the same content. The book that you buy is written by the professor who runs the course which I do not agree with. The book could be more direct in how it gives you the lessons.",0
"It said it could be done on your schedule, but that is not true. I want to withdraw from this stupid course - it sucks.",0
"When the instructor for the course expresses amazement at the level of difficulty people are expressing in the forums that tells you a lot about how out of touch he is with what he is teaching and what is really required prerequisite knowledge.There is minimal actual instruction in excel-most often concepts are taught much like Khan Academy, on a digital blackboard. Nothing inherently wrong with that but when your course title has the word 'EXCEL' in it one would reasonably expect the instructor to actually demonstrate using excel. Nope, not here.If you've never heard of linear regression or Bayes Theorem don't bother with this course. Honestly. While those things may be easy to explain without the math they are very difficult concepts to implement and a simple 10 minute video won't clear the fog.You absolutely will not 'master' data analysis with this course. I've used Excel for over 15 years, daily, and to have the gall to say your course will 'master' something with a few videos is misleading and deceptive.If it wasn't for the TA/Mentors who do the lions share of work in the forums answering questions and deciphering the questions so students can understand them this course would be an abysmal failure.If you're wanting to jump on the data analysis/ scientist bandwagon look elsewhere. i.e. EdX has a great course on a true introduction to data analysis that is more in line with people's impression of actually using excel in that context.Now, having bashed the course I do believe the instructor to be a very competent and knowledgeable individual, but I feel he's been in academia too long and has grown accustomed to teaching those who've been in school continuously and still have algebra/ stats fresh in their minds vs. those who need to brush away the cobwebs. The course in more on the level of a 201 and in certain parts 401 level but not 101.",0
Very disappointing course. Far too much repetition. A lot of opinion based on scant evidence. It would have been much better as a 30 minute video without all the fluff and unsubstantiated inferences. I would not recommend this course.,0
Course is not for free and misleading.,1
"This course -- actually, both the 2nd and 3rd courses in this specialization -- are like ""take your interested, but mostly uninformed friend to work day"". Give them some stacks of paper to sort, then shown them what a correctly sorted stack looks like. You've only got one day at work with your friend, so be kind enough to humor them with a very cursory explanation of what sorting is about, but you can't really teach them much in such a short time. So, set them to task, sorting pile after pile. Hey look! Your friend is now a practiced sorter!These courses are really for folks who can spend much more time than advertised. Sure, you will see lots of really cool things -- like AngularJS, Grunt, Bower, etc. -- but don't come into this believing that you'll really learn them, because that is just not possible with the time allowed. This whole thing is about exposure, not deep understanding.Want to learn the guitar? This is like going to watch a (very slow) concert, and then having the guitarist hand you their instrument, put your fingers on the correct frets, and then strum the strings for you. See -- now you can play!Thinking of learning algebra? How about if I simply told you to ""write the numeral 5, then the addition symbol, then the letter X, then the equals symbol, and finally the numeral 12"", and then proceeded to tell you, step-by-step, what you should write on the page in order to solve for X. Would you have learned about solving equations? At most, you would have written a workable example for solving a certain kind of equation, but I doubt you'd be anywhere near proficient after being hand-held through one example.On the positive side, I was exposed to many different things in the web-development world -- that I cannot argue against. However, this course could be so much more. The model of having students watch a video of a person talking about coding, whether in front of a Power Point slide or a text editor full of code, is borrowing from the worst of the ""lecture-first"" classroom experience of (most of) higher ed. It's a bummer that we aren't moving in a different direction with this stuff after so long, but I guess it's still what people expect (or at least have learned to cope with).",1
"I didn't like the python environment, I thought it will be more like Ng's course. Nice explanations, but for amateurs.",1
If there had been a working autograder for the last final project this course would have been worth it somehow.What does that mean?- The lectures provided valuable information.- The quizzes generally made sense (in relation to the lectures).- Learning how to code wasn't really possible.Why is that?- There is only one programming assignment.- The autograder doesn't give any feedback at all why resp. where things go wrong. That's everything but good style (for software as well as for learning).- Code snippets can't be tested individually. That's very bad behavior in programming.- At the end working code that meets the teached rules is marked as wrong. You are lost without any clue.So probably you can learn something. Unfortunately you can't possibly finish the course with a feeling of success.,1
I want it to be more exciting.,1
Very slow moving. Feels like you have to sit through a lot for very obvious information. I would recommend http://ielanguages.com/linguistics/ for a more detailed and more concise introduction.,1
A very slow and dull course. Lost my interest Half way.Probably a course for non-native English speaking students.,1
"This Course is very easy to learn, all it's themes are so good explained.I'm sorry but I might to change the RATE of this course.All went well until the course started reading the explanation of code , after that ... I lost , and I could not continue , because It just came out of nowhere , coding , there wasn't a previous step that says , we will encode here , or are we going to do this somewhere ... just appeared and disappeared as it appeared ... ... we were very well ... but I can not say much more !",1
"A large portion of the course is just copy and pasting code that is provided to you. While the code that is pasted is explained, and a lot of content is covered as a result of not having to write it, I feel my overall retention is much lower than in other courses.",1
Very good lectures and examples. Horrible autograder - very stiff and all results must be in a very strict order and format. Extremenly vague questions prone to misinterpretation.Most of the time is not spent on analysing data or coding but trying to understand the autograder and questions. The stress should be somewhere else. As a whole poorly prepared course.,1
why intro is so long?it becomes boring without any physical interpretation of knowledgecan't you take at least one design project or demomany things were said but very little went in head,1
The course content and the assignments are too far apart. I would have learned more if it was better aligned and there were some exercise in between.,1
"Only very very basics. They won't teach you make well formed HTML documents, complete CSS files or learn to program in JavaScript.",1
"Too much material, that moved too fast. Wasn't opportunity for enough feedback and explanation. I say this as someone who went to Duke and has taken similar classes at Duke!",1
"I didn't like the professor's teaching style. He took way more time than was necessary to get his points across. Plus the little quips where he's pretending to engage with the viewer made it feel like a kids show. There were some good nuggets of info, but there was too much filler to get to it.",1
"The course and presentations were very informational and good. I enjoyed that aspect. I would have rated the course 4-5 star based on that. The reason for the low rating was the 6th module, and the fact that I felt very ill prepared for the syntax of creating all the operations in Spark (building out the Jupiter notebook). We really did not cover much of that, and it was quite punishing to search the web and sources to make things work. Even the instructions to export the csv file were misleading at best. I have a full time job and a family, I am not some young undergraduate with copious amounts of time to waste. While I am not opposed to some searching of other sources, I would like to have more of the useful information taught so that it is not so much of a burden. I believe that if you are going to test people on something, you should at least cover it in some sense.",1
"Not beginner friendly, might be good as a refresher for grad students",1
"THIS course is only good if you have basic knowledge regarding ,materials science and this course is highly based on research papers and research domain . Overall a good course .",1
I feel that the course does cover adequate topic to improve our mastery of data analysis in Excel. The course is more focus on the statistic and probability theory without giving adequate explanation on how to work on Excel.,1
"HTML and CSS were GREAT. JavaScript was very confusing as it did not teach me what each part of the code meant, including the syntax --- and hence I was unable to understand anything by Week 4, despite having listened to all the lectures and participated in the all the activities. I wish JavaScript's structure was more consistent with that of HTML and CSS.",1
"its more a linux introducction, not the expected from the title. the content is good but no what was expeceted, as it said interfacing I thought it was more about sensors and gpio programming",1
"The informations were useful, but the videos were repetitive. This whole course had the amount of informations as one week of many others. If it was free I would have no complaints, but since it is part of a specialization, I expect more. Removing all the fat each week would have 10 minutes worth of material.Also I did not appreciate the length at which the speakers promoted their books.",1
Boring techniques for remembering.Nothing related to learning or understanding.,1
"The videos were ok, reading materials added some value, although about three years have passed since the launch of the original course and the materials are all the same. I expected that something new would be introduced to give it a bit more value. But what is very questionable is the architecture of the quizzes. On one hand it goes way beyond the simplicity of the lenght of the course, assume a mindset that extends well beyond this course, and on the other hand after doing the quizzes some times and observing the considered right and wrong answers, some of them - to say the least, are highly ambiguous and express a personal point of view of the instructor in what is right or wrong (what by itself is not very reasonable), and lack ultimately in objectivity regarding the materials covered. I am not by any means saying that the quizzes are hard or simple, I am saying that they lack objectivity and go beyond the scope of the materials and try to put the student on a state of trying to guess what the instructor's opinion is regarding the question at hand. In some cases the 'best' answer chosen is absurd. Highly questionable this approach. Again, I believe that evaluations should be challeging, but these quizzes are a bit esoteric, they lack objectivity.Nonetheless, it is important to say thank you for being present in this platform and having the will to put it together. I wish you luck for the future.",1
I was interested in this course but as it stands it is more like marketing hype than a proper course. For one thing it tries to cover far too much material in 4 weeks. Within the limited scope of the beta test I started the node red stuff. It looks easy but the lecturer didn't make it clear what it was for anyway.A much more thorough introduction should have been given to everything.The lectures on the Rasberry Pi were a joke. In order to do the course within 4 weeks I would have had to order a Rasberry Pi before getting to these lectures. A clear guide to course prerequisites and the Rasberry Pi and Sensehat must be provided.Neither of the tutors seem very happy about their job. This is a small point and not a show stopper.Overall - don't issue this course without major revisions (perhaps a new course team).,1
Very basic knowledge,1
"some swirl tests (4,5) don't work because of parameter method in qplot function. This parameter is not realy existed in this function now",1
"Nice idea, but too many technical difficulties. I tried to complete quiz 4 nine times and eventually passed the deadline. And in order to submit my final assignment I had to embedded my images into a word doc and export it as a PDF... I won't get extra marks for being able to work THAT out! ; )I did enjoy the rest of the course though. Thanks for all your efforts.",1
This course is to much about graphlab and not enough about the mechanics of machine learning.,1
"Love Coursera but was disappointed in this course. Being a true beginner w/no background in programming or data science, I felt the programming assignments were way too far a stretch from the Swirl exercises (which I felt were super helpful and beginner appropriate) and lectures. I spent 8-12 hrs on each one just googling and trying to decipher the programming jargon that most responses were written in. I was able to figure out workable code for most problems but I feel like I am still lacking the basic fundamentals underlying the solutions to these assignments and would have a hard time reproducing solutions to similar problems.",1
"Having completed the assignment after many hours of trial & error; here are some suggestions for improving the class for future sessions.Increase the length and depth of the lectures so that more of the materials needed for the assignment are covered.For each week, have an optional programming exercise (not graded) but with a model answer (with explanations of why) so that students have a concrete example on which to practice key concepts on.As classes & structs are very important to completing the assignment (instead of just including the SWIFT manual chapter on classes & structs in the Follow Up Reading), include an actual lecture about this topic.Improve the description of the assignment to be completed. Be specific about what is required (e.g.; what does interface mean? Is is a User interface or is just a specified variable which can be changed in the program code? What do you mean by order of applying filters? Do you mean a variable which lets you decide order of filters and executes the filters accordingly or does the ability to manually rearranging the order of the calling of functions in the code suffice?)Improve the alignment between the assignment and the review criteria. The assignment asks for FIVE filters but there is no matching criterion in the review criteria. Based on the current review criteria, creating two filters would suffice to demonstrate ability to order and get full points for varying intensity for more than 1 filter.I hope the remainder of the modules are better otherwise I will be extremely disappointed !",1
"This material is important, but the assessment quizzes were tedious as the right answer often hung on some small obscure remark that was hard to recall.",1
I don't feel learning much after the class. Particularly I think the video should be better made to present the spreadsheet content more clearly and i think there should be more emphasis on important points during the lecture session.,1
"The lecturer is very good. The course is not very insightful and on the surface. It is business oriented, it doesn't deal with interesting and challenging academic problems.",1
"The course introduces some basic concepts but fails to deliver on the objectives set out in the initial module description by barely listing out most topics through a very narrow, linear approach instead of delivering an actual in-depth explanation and commentary on the subject. Some more advanced learners will also find some tools to be out-of-date and some areas - very Google-focused.",1
"I understand that this is a project centered course, however I do not feel like I walked away with a solid foundation of what goes into creating synthesizer sounds. Sure I learned that I can change parameters within a synthesis program and thereby get various sounds, but that's about all. I was expecting to gain fundamental understanding of the various parameters and what they really do and a more solid understanding of the process of creating custom patches rather then following an example and subsequently making minor adjustments so that it fits my style.",1
"A lot of the lecture material is unclear and does not fit with the content I've learned from other BI books, lectures, and experience. Additionally, the quizzes don't seem to test for real-world BI knowledge, rather they test for the ability to interpret the instructors fairly unique views on some BI topics. Furthermore, the additional readings need to be culled significantly, it looks like someone just googled BI topics and then copy and pasted the links they found. Please prioritize the additional readings highest value to lowest value and then post only the 4 to 7 reading that rank the highest. A pairwise comparison process may be useful when doing this.",1
It was difficult to me! I think that 's more appropriate to whom is already familiarized with the terms and concepts.,1
"This course is great, but Brian is certainly not a good instructor. He does not explain things well, and articulate examples. I had to take Statistical Inference from Duke university to pass this course.",1
This course is somewhat lacking depth. The introduced tools are very basic and I would have expected more content for the prize,1
"I wish the courses are more project oriented. This is a very good introduction but, atleast you could provide some optional projects or some tasks.",1
"Materials and topics were good, but the course lacks in two things. They stress more on math and theory. I would suggest additional videos explaining the implementation in matlab would be helpful and would throw more insight to the maths. Second there is no programming assignments, so its a little easy kind of. If the instructor or the TA would help out in giving the assignments and implementation in matlab, then it will be one of the ever-lasting courses",1
"While the content of the course is interesting and useful, the delivery desperately needs improvement. The professors speak in an extremely monotonous way, making it seem like they are reading their lines from behind the camera. Just awful, and makes it really hard to follow and stay interested and connected with the topic (even when you're passionate about the subject).I would rather have the course in Italian, and read the subtitles, if that means a more energetic delivery.",1
I do not feel that this course is ready for publication and is overlong for the material presented.,1
It consists mostly of video lectures there is a lack of coding exercises,1
It seems like the team have tried to do the whole course in one take! Perhaps some practice would have been in order? at least to work out what they are going to say next.... content is ok so far but delivery is tough to listen to.,1
"The information in the videos was very interesting and well presented. I feel like I learned a lot. However, the quizzes and tests seemed to be of a very different level, and often covered material that was hardly discussed in the lectures. I understand that students are expected to do independent learning of material, but the gulf between lectures and test difficulty was extreme. If others were interested in learning about the basics of music theory, I would not recommend this course.",1
"I think the content itself is somewhat too theoretical, it does not usually apply to the reality",1
"Positive aspects:Readings were relevant and interesting.I learned a lot.I was challenged.Negative aspects:Programming assignments took SIGNIFICANTLY longer than suggested (I have 20+ years of programming experience and am fluent in 3 programming languages, but I'm new to Python).Course did not provide enough support to learners. You're on your own to learn the material and you won't get timely responses (if any) from the staff. I asked clarifying questions about lecture material on the Discussion Forums and got no response (twice).Several concepts were not taught with appropriate detail / explanation. For example, there was no instruction on how to read error messages in Python.",1
"As for information in course itself, it was interesting for me to enroll and to be part of the course.But I highly dislike that there was a feeling of that the lecturer is trying to remember any things right while the video goes. It is not a real class, it is a video and it could be done much more accurately. There were many many boring moments, while management itself is not a boring discipline, it is very interesting.Anyway I am glad I participated in the course.",1
Material is very basic for anyone with even the smallest amount of programming experience. Very slow pace,1
"Poor visual communications, it should be better since it is the only way to follow the course.Should be nice if the slides counted with a kind of animation to enphatize what we are talking about.",1
"Honestly I cannot believe that this course won't allow people to go an extra mile to make something better and learn more than what course was designed for. How is it possible that I try to do something different and better than what I was requested to do and because of that I got bad gradings because it was different even though it met the projects requirements? I left a complaint and this is the response from one of the mentors ""john f davis replied: all I could say is keep your personal touch in your GitHub and submit the nonpersonal touch version to be graded.""How is this going to allow the students to learn more if they are going to be graded badly if they do? If we are not allowed to work on something greater? I'm disappointed with the peer grading system but even more with this kind of attitude from a ""mentor"".",1
Very basic introduction to Data Science. Seasoned programmer or other IT professionals are likely to find this course really weak.,1
"I saw two main issues with this course: 1) dated lecture videos, oftentimes with R code that can't be replicated using up-to-date packages, and 2) lack of thoughtful design: example after example after example after example doesn't really teach you anything.",1
"The course starts very promising, but it gets worse week after week, culminating on a barely understandable week about dynamic programming. Thatâs when I gave up and decided to write this review instead, with just one assignment missing to complete the course.Some of the teachers arenât native english speakers, which is fine, but their english is very hard to understand. I found myself having to watch some portions of the videos over and over again in order to understand what was being said. I tried reading the transcripts instead, but the theyâre even worse! It seems that they were automatically generated from the videos, thus suffering with the poor pronunciation.The teachers use mathematical sophistication that feels unnecessary, but to be fair, they do mention it on the FAQ as part of the necessary background. However, even though itâs an online course, they barely use any teaching method besides very raw slides, some dry mathematical proofs and someone speaking about the content. The only resources offered to help learning are a few open source visualizations. I expected much more.The only good aspect from this course are the assignment checkers, which allow you to write your solutions in multiple languages.I deeply regret the money and time I spent on this course.",1
Big difference in difficulty between the math-heavy codec theory lectures and the other material which is quite basic. Not much to do with the DragonBoard.,1
Might be an instructive course but the guy who presents it is really creepy. And knowing he was involved in the official 9/11 report makes him hard to believe on any issue.,1
you can take the assignments only if you pay,1
Platitudes and generalizations. The interviews with real people are the only redeeming factor. I wasn't impressed.,1
"The first courses are great.Unfortunately, the course that covered the installation (week 2 - ""create your first basic application with android studio"") got me lost.",1
"I can't say I really enjoyed this 5 week course. The flow itself was more like ""food for thought"" where a bunch of ideas are presented as sort of an intellectual gymnastics exercise with no point really. By week 5 you are just plain bored. The content wasn't concise enough. It could have easily been a 4 week course or even shorter had they not tried to belabor each topic. It all was too high level and never really got down enough to earth. I have done other courses on the same topic which were better put together.",1
1-week does not seem enough for a Crash Course,1
"I greatly enjoyed the material presented in this course and while I do not doubt the proficiency of it's creators the poor standard of spoken English of its two main presenters prevents me from recommending it to colleagues. As another reviewer has remarked, their English may be quite sufficient for day to day use with other experts but for inadequate for teaching students who are hearing many technical terms for the first time. The transcripts are no better and also contain many mistakes. I believe that this course should be stopped until these problems are corrected.",1
Lessons are very good but the Assignments for the later weeks are way too hard for people with no math or programming experience.,1
"Lectures were extremely good, but assignments and graders were very low quality and difficult to decipher requirements from. Professors and TAs were not active in the forums.",1
Somehow simple presentations.,1
Problem with quiz week 2,1
"75% of the course is amazing, the rest needs some work. The course feels as if its target population is lower-level undergraduates or the general population. Would love to see more advanced graduate level content included.",1
"Not really about Product Management, but about Project Management",1
"Logic can be fun, but this class pretty much kills that spirit by burying it under pretty horrendous and tedious formalization. An intro to logic should be considerably simpler, and with more interesting content and exercises.",1
Muy light,1
"Felt very much like an exercise in writing-by-numbers. Assignment instructions were too vague and the pass/fail grading system meant lots of classmates were upset that their work was not appreciated or understood. So many people on the course do not have English as a first language that the marking is often erratic. Great that non-native speakers are trying to write in English, enriching the canon, but in those circumstances a pass/fail system seems misguided.",1
"I really enjoyed the first two weeks. When it came to JavaScript I couldn't follow, so much information was missing and lessons were not clear anymore. I understand that the goal was to teach the most in a short time but this was not the right approach.",1
"The course gives practice in Python, but programming assignments were loaded with ""busy work"" that added little value and often had only loose ties to the material discussed in class. While this forces more independent learning, it also makes it so that this course isn't really much better than free online tutorials. I found myself learning almost everything for the programming assignments from the pandas package documentation and from Google searches that led to stackoverflow. For an instructor from the University of Michigan whose bio says ""I work with colleagues to design tools to better the teaching and learning experience in higher education,"" I was expecting a lot more value for the time spent in this class. I suspect that this course is being used to provide data for furthering his own research. It's often more difficult to maximize value to customers when personal incentives may not be perfectly aligned with customer (student) objectives.",1
"Too long, too diversified, too much usage of technical terms; heterogenous content.",1
So Basic and only useful for common knowledge not something for a specialization,1
"This course is not well designed, there are multiple mistakes in the videos, assignments, etc. The content is covered after you already had to apply it in an assignment in a previous lesson. The tests are also not well made. The instructions to peer-reviewed assignments are not clear and will not bring you to the correct result which is shown during peer review. No involvement from the faculty, no one to answer questions.",1
Very basic info suited for highschool students. Many errors in transcripts that you will just have to slog through.,1
Provided Unity scripts for projects don't work properly with newer versions of Unity. Quality of video recording is kind of crappy esp. audio. Most of the stuff learned in this course you'd be able to learn straight from the Unity tutorials anyway. Not recommended unless you absolutely need scheduled assignments in order to learn.,1
About plotting in R. Not about generating real insights from EDA.,1
"Hard getting through this course. It is probably because I don't have Adobe Lightroom software. Perhaps if I eventually get it, I will re-visit this course as the tutorials are thorough. I scored it as I did because I think the course title should have Lightroom & Pixlr in there since weeks 3 & 4 dominate those two.",1
It is too small and shallow. Whole specialization is actually one full course split into 4 tiny parts.,1
Instructions were very unclear compared to the rest of the courses in the specialization.,1
"The course feels pretty shallow and it ignores all the interesting stuff like proofs. There is no written material available, so if you can't follow the lectures, poor you. Quizzes aren't very well formulated and sometimes the correct answer is more of a matter of opinion rather than a hard fact. Evaluation seems to be based solely on peer review and there are no model solutions available, so the points you'll get may vary depending on how your peers understood the assignment and if they were interested in the review process at all.My overall feeling is that nothing was quite challenging on the course, and I didn't learn much more than what I could have learnt by reading a few paragraphs per topic from Wikipedia. I also felt that the programming assignments were quite disjoint from the core, tough I don't feel like I understand the core better than before the course because none of the assignments made me think why something works, rather than that we just mechanically reproduced the examples shown in the lectures.",1
Not really helpfull,1
"Theoretically good course, could have been made more interesting by including more examples or cae studies.",1
"The course really isn't that useful for day to day management decision making. It might be more useful for those who look solely at long term data and make choices ""at a distance"" so to speak. Very heavy focus on charts and graphs....so there's a lot to it but very little you can sink your teeth into unless you have a very specific type of management in mind.",1
"information is useful. But, still, it is a shame to split one month course to 4.",1
Far too easy and far too basic for me. I would have hoped for a more in-depth and scientific look at food and nutrition.,1
"There are too many poured notions without practical explanations or case studies. Slides are read bullet point after bullet point without added value. The course is not compelling in any way. Too many references to a book said to be not compulsory.In the final exam right answers are not given.The course gives you just a smattering of the subject, nothing that you can apply with confidence on the job.",1
not very explanatory,1
"The touch on a lot of topics, but do not provide nearly enough information to make it worth staying through the course.",1
The video lectures are really boring and useless,1
Very shallow,1
"2 stars because the theoretical part is ok but programming assignments are waste of time. I'm not here (and paid) to be trained to use something the instructor is trying to SELL, nor will I ever recommend this product for commercial use. I will switch to other ""not recommended"" packages in the later parts of this specialization.They should put the disclaimer for Graphlab Create in the specialization page so people can be aware of this.Besides, the sound of that Giraffe toy is really, really annoying.",1
"Apart from the book the courses does not offer me anything. No videos, no active forum, no explanation. Also the assessment is not interesting and there is no much information in the teaching material in order to be able to do the assessment.I am very disappointed with this Specialization.",1
"Algorithmic Toolbox consists of a series of slides containing slimmed down explanations on introductory algorithmic concepts, followed up with programming assignments. The slides are the centrepiece of the course, as the presenters rarely stray from the bullet points and pseudocode they're comprised of.I learned a lot during this course. Although, to gain confidence in your knowledge, this is a course that will require you to seek out additional materials to supplement your learning. Perhaps unsurprising being an introductory course, but the presenters struggle when faced with setting expectations.Throughout the course presenters often gloss over fairly complex concepts, treating them as they were trivial knowledge. This applies to mathematical definitions, proofs where most steps are skipped, tree diagrams without the context of their underlying theory, or bullet points used in place of what could be detailed explanations.All material is left equally weighted. Rather than providing explanations like: ""We don't need to go into detail on this, only x concept from it is important for what we want to focus on. Reference this chapter in this book for more detail."" presenters would read mathematical definitions verbatim from the slides and move on. I was often unsure of how much I would need to know about such concepts.In terms of communication ability, the presenters don't hold up against many of the free/low-cost services I'm accustomed to using, for example: MIT OpenCourseWare, Udacity, edX, Khan Academy, Code School, Treehouse, etc. Perhaps unsurprising, as these competing services often feature professional communicators rather than professional researchers. But the marketplace for quality online education is definitely becoming a competitive one. Users now expect nothing less than presenters with exceptional communication/teaching ability.In most videos the presenters read verbatim from the slides and motion with their hands to explain concepts that would be better broken down on a whiteboard. Rarely straying from the slides, the times the presenters go into more depth on a concept, you get a scribble in the corner of a slide, lacking the clarity I've come to expect when approaching complex concepts from master educators like YouTuber PatrickJMT or Khan Academy. After a couple weeks into the course, I just went straight to the slides, read MIT's Introduction to Algorithms, and skipped most of the course videos.But all things considered, the course served as a good curriculum to guide my focus through the introductory concepts, regardless of where I sought it out.",1
very bad course but i have come to the point that it is ok for the beginers,1
"The transition is from easy to advanced. It gets really confusing, not sure if it's just me. I am not following the lessons anymore so I left the course.",1
"Lectures are careless prepared. It's really hard to follow this course without previous background in iOS development, despite it's called ""Introduction To Swift Programming"". There are a lot of small misleadings notes in course materials. Hope the next course in specialization ""iOS App Development with Swift"" would be much better.",1
"Not a bad introduction, but if you already know a bit about programming you can get the same basics and learn more quickly with a book.",1
"The professor just read the materials through all the modules, and the course was really boring. But, the content was quite updated that was the only good thing. Does not worth such a high payment.",1
"This course has some great information and guidance for delving into the social media landscape. However, the tools that come with the paid version are not easy to use or well explained for the lay person.",1
"The course didn't feel as though it was aimed at a university level audience, which is what I expect from Coursera courses. I I did appreciate the prompt that the assignments gave me to actually sit down and write, but so far the feedback wasn't very helpful. I think that there should be much more guidance on how to give good feedback to peers. Reading a good number of submissions from members of the course, I didn't feel that this course gave them the practical skills needed for good prose, but w",1
The assignments are highly dissociated from the course material. Also once the due date has passed sharing the best solution would help so as to give insights on what could have been done better.,1
"It was way too theoretical, the concepts were not clearly explained, the tests had concepts that had not been explained and the teacher is not good explaining it, it is too monotonous",1
The course material was useful however greatly disappointed with the organisation. Many quizzes had in-complete questions (no figures) and there was no corrections made. I had to resort to checking through forums for the correct questions.,1
"Its too easy. The exercises and quizzes are too simple to solve. Once can easily read 4-5 chapters from book in a single day and can complete this course. I feel that the duration (5weeks) for this course is way too long. The concepts discussed could have been easily understood in 3 weeks (at max). Also, I think the fees is high for such trivial concepts.",1
"This was much less about the development of games as it was an intro to Unity. Furthermore, the assignments weren't graded on a timely basis, which left very room to collaborate and refine. Overall, I felt like I learned to follow a few basic things about Unity, nothing more.",1
Course content feels upside down. You'll learn about machine algorithm specifics and caveats before anyone explains what the said algorithm actually hopes to achieve.,1
too much speciific details that make the course difficult to understanding.,1
"The class isn't over but I'm suffering through it, not enjoying it, like I did the dino Uof A classes. Problems: the presenter is HORRIBLE. He's sing-songy, trying to be interesting. Can't you get the dino guy? Or me -I'll do it for free. PAINFUL. Also - you need more graphics. Charging along with Mr. Boring and a map of Alaska behind him as concept after concept - difficult ones for folks who aren't like me with lots of background - is a perfect recipe for lack of comprehension. Even inept and cheesy graphics would be better than nothing. Yes, I noticed that the earth is spinning the wrong way in the ""sun at an angle around the sun"" graphic but who cares? It's something. And yes, I know it's free, and I know you have budgets, but 3 universities can't rustle up a graphics undergrad to help out and call it an internship?? The content is probably better than my perception - and I'm perceiving high! - because I need an aspirin after 20 minutes of Mr. Please Get A Professional Presenter [or at least competent.] I create online education that is nothing better than Powerpoint and a talking head, lack of budget, but at least the head doesn't make people want to drown themselves in a melting glacier.",1
"Not the worst, but I did not think this was a well developed course. It felt like an informal conversation between the instructors with one of them repeatedly calling different aspects of Swift ""cool"". It was very distracting. I also thought the tests were vaguely worded and the final assignment was long and definitely more than the 30 minutes it said it would take to complete it. I am all for difficult challenges, but it felt like the final project was badly designed/described. Un-enrolling.",1
"The course covers the basic foundations of behavioral finance, especially prospect theory and various cognitive biases that negatively influence our decision making in financial affairs.The topics covered are definitely very interesting and the lecturers frequently prove that they know what they are talking about and explain some topics in adequate depth and breadth.For a valuable Coursera course I am expecting that most of the material is covered with video lectures (otherwise I read a book on that matter) and I am expecting thought-through slides with clear definitions, clear practical examples and exercises, and the presentation of experimental proofs for the given statements.Regrettably, most of this course is comprised of simple slides with limited structuring, as definitions, exercises, and proofs are often intermingled. More importantly, only a very limited subset of the course is covered with the suitable and valuable video lectures.Especially the last of the three-week course consist mostly of reading material from an external website.The exercises after each of the three weeks are at the lower end of what I have seen on Coursera and the lecturers should consider putting more effort in creating useful questions for formative and summative evaluations of the learning progress.In summary, smart lecturers present a very interesting and highly relevant topic, but they put to little effort in creating a compellingly online course.",1
"Ref: ""A Crash Course in Data Science"" the content could be presented in a simpler way. Some of the presentations sounds little vague and conceptual level like an Advanced Math or, Statistics class. I am wondering since this is an Executive program, is there a simpler and easy to grasp way to present the material. The text download files (i.e. txt) document descriptions needs to be more clearer. The Power Point downloads are excellent and are to the point.",1
bad explanation and poor introduction,1
"I'm here learning Excel skills, but this course, especially week 2, does not teach Excel skills.",1
Too simple and lack of practice exercises!,1
I couldn't take the instructor seriously. There were too many comparisons to Harry Potter and various three and five act formulas. I wanted something that would be practical and adaptable to the ideas that I'm working on. This just wasn't the right course for me. The assignments felt like they were pointless as well.,1
"I have to say, I am disappointed in that I feel there is little to no interaction here between students and instructors/aides. Additionally, the assignments are not functioning properly and it creates much confusion. The instructors videos are great and have been helpful but the rest is lacking! There is no way to view other's bodies of work and critiques are very vague, etc. This is photography... where is the photography from learners (other than the assignments)? Why is there no gallery here?",1
"While the content of this course was presented in an engaging way, the assessment task lacks context. To then be asked to peer review others based on this is particularly disengaging.",1
"I have no doubt teachers are excelent professionals in the area, as well as great machine learning enthusiasts. However, I did not like the fact that you get limited to learn how to use a paid and (very!) expensive platform, mostly because there are many other free packages available for machine learning. Ok, the platform offered makes things easier, but if you really want to learn machine learning, you can not be limited to a platform, acting as a robot just using pre-written functions in a black box.",1
"I liked fun videos, some explanations and teachers. But the quality has really disappointed :( A huge amount of misprints in printable exercises, a few grammar mistakes in the answers, mistakes in the execution of the online exercises. The part about passive tenses is only about one tense Past Simple. And the whole design is really destructing! Awful typefaces, different styles, different colors. I enjoyed some explanation in videos and fun teachers, but in general, I'm really happy I haven't paid for this course.",1
Not that helpful for me,1
"I was quite disappointed by this course, after several delays the course stated months later than originally planned. The videos are badly edited, and there did not seem to be a lot of content within this course.",1
"Extremely dry, academic style presentation, could use a LOT of work to make it appeal to others in the future. ""Lesser"" Vehicle is also considered an insult in many circles. Not a good title for a class.",1
"The course lacks for the practice exersises. Instead, the quizes are full of questions like ""Present Simple tense is used to write about a special study implemented by a well-known scientist. True or false"". The questions of this type are pointless. Still, the videos sometimes contain useful information.",1
"This is NOT a step-wise introduction to R for the novice. Useful in many respects, but the uninitiated to the field need more time, slow increments in project difficulty and more thorough, step by step explanations. I think the designers of the course wrongly assume that ALL R programming should be taught in THIS course which is erroneous; it should be about laying the foundations, on which the student can then expand his/her R programming abilities.",1
"I thing this course should have one or two more modules. It's definitely to short to grasp the basics of JavaScript. For complete beginners it should start with a module about Foundations of Programming and after explain in depth what is a method, a property, an event, a calculation, a variable, an object, etc.... After I finished all the modules of this course, always coding along the lectures and having done all the assignments to practice and having read the extra material, by the end of this course I didn't had a solid foundation about how to program in JavaScript. So, if you enrolled the Web Design Specialization, after the HTML & CSS's courses you will have solid foundation about those languages, you will also grasp the basics of Responsive Design course but you will have to do other JavaScript courses to became a Junior Front-End Developer in the ""real life"".",1
"Very, very high altitude introduction presented in a seemingly confused way with a lot of product placement.",1
"It was overall a good course for a beginner but too much theoretical things are there, one needs to push more on practicals.",1
"I am relatively experienced programmer trying to just understand the Android app development framework and solve some interesting challenges along the way. I feel the course, was very painstaking in terms of code reviewing other people's work.If I were to break up the time I spent doing the course work, it would be as follows:30 % useful work70 % taking care of course logistics (code review, writing comments on every line of code just so that people being asked to review my work are happy). Why do we have to do so many code reviews? Not every assignment requires people's coding style to be evaluated. It places an unnecessary time burden on people who are taking this course not as full time student. Its also reducing the total amount of knowledge that is being disseminated. We should be learning about Android for 4 more hours rather than reviewing code for other people for 4 more hours.The thing I found most frustrating is that the assignments are trying to force a particular coding style on everyone. Since I am an experienced programmer, I understand the importance of coding style, creating functions and all that. However, how I structure my code and how many comments I write are entirely my choice.Now, while I understand that the course material itself does not ask you to structure code one way or another; the review guidelines that are being given to some very inexperienced programmers, makes them believe that this is the only way things should be done. Its a subtle form of style enforcement which I did not appreciate.",1
"This course is rather superficial, it sadly did not provide practical tips that go beyond common sense.",1
"This course seems patched together. The volume isn't consistent, even within videos. Some videos / slides are great and full of information, while others are just long periods of talking with one word or phrase on the screen and none of the information put in written form.Some of the questions occur in multiple practice quizzes. Also, there are misspellings in the quizzes. Finally, one quiz marked a question wrong and then, in the comments, noted the answer was right.Further, some of the videos seem to stretch out information to fill time.",1
"My suggestions:** videos: pace is way too fast, and without much visuals and a clear structure/plan, hard to fully grab in one view. I don't think your 5mn max duration really makes sense. When the content is of interest, better to make it longer to improve clarity. Positive: you provide written/text versions of your videos.** support documents: way too many and not always relevant** quizzes: i don't think that asking us the name of a founder etc. really test anything about our understanding of our lesson. Too many irrelevant questions.All in all, it seems you applied one of the rules you discuss in this course: release fast, and adjust later on based on customers' feedback.. Unsure this is the right approach when it comes to online learning. I had higher expectations vs. Mines Telecom.",1
The course is very hard due to the difficulty of the explanation. The course has a lot of points to cover with few explanation,1
"This is just a poor sample of a course. Very few material, low quality assignments and grading.",1
Could have been more interactive .The ruby course that I studied from lynda.com was far better than this,1
"Not the greatest Python course in the world. Teaching seems unprofessional and disorganized, technical issues are common, and the discussion forums do not offer much value, as you cannot discuss your code with your peers, and the forum staff are more than often unhelpful. The exercises are unoriginal and do not require much creative thinking - often it's enough to copy & paste code from the lectures and change a few variables around! You're better of looking for other Python beginner courses on the Coursera platform, as well as on other platforms. The only thing I liked about the course were the interviews with people behind Python, but otherwise the course does not facilitate deeper learning and is not engaging.",1
the course is a bit outdated and I am finding it hard to stay motivated knowing there are other more recent courses. The topics I think are still relevant but the tools are not. I am looking for courses where there is hands on development that you follow with the instructor and I did not find this here.,1
"There just wasn't much to this class. It's not bad information, but it could have been done in one week.",1
"The only interesting part was dplyr. The rest was too confusing, with lots of lists and no explanations.",1
"Aimed at those needing to get services -- in a spectrum of family living. Too much on California systems, not enough on direct coping with day-to-day.",1
"I think it is a decent course to understand how the peer review process work. However, it does not really help to write a paper. I think some ideas are not applied to every field. In particular, telling students to look for the board of editors in a journal and adapt your results and how you express things accordingly, it is in my opinion a bit unethical. Moreover, I was expecting that the course will be taught by a professor, but instead, it is done by a group of PhDs, some of them in their first year of research. If they intend to target a PhD audience, this is clearly a drawback as some of them might know the same as you do. Finally, as some people already pointed out, the quality of the English of some of the instructor is not good. In particular, there are a couple of them that you can't barely understand. It would have been more useful if the full course is taught by the 2 of them that can actually speak good.",1
"Some topics that are important, are obviated",1
"The video lectures were not on par with the, in my opinion, extremely demanding programming assignments. I'd say some knowledge of advanced coding was required in order to complete the assignments, or alternatively, lots of time to learn by yourself on google and forums, which wasn't really the point, was it.",1
The course was hard to follow and understand.,1
Barely any depth,1
"This will be an excellent course for undergrads and high school students but not much in depth knowledge and learning strategy for higher levels of education.Teachers show mastery on their subject matter , though their presentation style is not genuine and naturally animated, to the point that it may feel boring.",1
"Very dry and uninspired.The lecturer monotonically reads off some material.The explanations don't usually make any sense.The quizzes are a guessing game, arbitrarily connected (or not) to the lecture material.In retrospect: a waste of my time.",1
"The lack of teacher or teaching assistant participation in the forum discussions is deafening. For an institution like the host institution, this is odd. I liked the course, but it was not very well organized. Seems like it was for experienced musicians, eve though the goals of the course hinted at it being for beginners as well. Good Course, badly organized.",1
Poor video and audio quality. Not worth the price.,1
Please include exercises for computing the ratios and the valuation methods. In-video questions would have helped more. The quiz does not actually test the understanding of the topic in-depth. There can be some external readings suggested - resources that help us get more understanding on the subjects discussed.,1
"Lost after 2nd week. I really liked the Python For Everyone Course so I thought I would like this one as well, but it was not done to the same standard. I will find another way to learn Ruby.",1
"While I love Dr. van Lent's teaching style, I was somewhat disappointed in the course as a whole. After about the first week the instructor was not heard from again on the forums. It wasn't until about the last week that some official teaching staff started to make an appearance.This was an issue as, especially in the first week, as there was a good deal of discrepancy between what was on the grading rubric, what was provided in description for the homework, and what was in an optional video that described the homework. All with no official direction as to what was correct, or how things should be properly graded. The students were just left to themselves to try and interpret what the instructor meant, and what was the proper thing to do in regards to the peer grading. This continued, albeit to a far lesser extent, through the remainder of the course.While I don't expect instructors to be in the forums all that often, I do expect them to clear up obvious issues, and to make some type of official statement as to how students should proceed. I believe this was the first offering of this course, and I hope as it offered again those discrepancies are fixed, and perhaps more official teaching staff are able to monitor the forums.As far as the material itself, it is pretty good, and covers most of the basics well. As I said at the start, I really love Dr. van Lent's teaching style. She is very encouraging, and easy to understand. She is also very human, making mistakes as she goes along, and correcting them. I feel this gives the student a good experience of the real world iterative process that coding is, that even with experience mistakes are still made, and to be expected, and how to go about doing some debugging to correct those mistakes.",1
The course is outdated and abandoned by the teachers.SwiftKey engineers are nowhere to be seen.There is no guidance.,1
get new material - new videos these videos for all your classes are years old - the quizes dont relate to the material taught and it seems you guys got this set up years ago and just forgot about it,1
Doesn't look quite helpful. Just some common things.,1
Week 1 a little disapointing,1
"A lot of formulas and theory which if attempted by the casual investor would quickly overwhelm him and reduce him to a babbling idiot with no investments.One useful tip: Use a 20% drop in ""Consumer Confidence"" to warn you of an impending recession and sell everything; back into equity when the Consumer Confidence level gets back to its trigger point.",1
"The lecturer is clear, but there is a problem with the paste.It is much too slow. He states the obvious too often, talks VERY slowly, and that makes it hard to stay focused.",1
Too short and easy.,1
"This class would do well to have supplemental or required readings and much more difficult quizzes. I think it would be possible to have one's wisdom teeth removed and complete this course on a binge-watching spree while on pain killers. That shouldn't be possible. Good lecturers, though.",1
Could have utilized video lectures more. Questions on final exam did not seem to relate to materials covered in course. Course seems to just comprise 1 or 2 minute long video lectures and then direct students to vast amounts of online reading material.,1
all this course justified one class at top.,1
"Not up to my expectations. Compared to the previous modules in this specialisation, the lectures are dry, the presenter is not focused and slides are sometimes mixed up. The reading material is great and a definite plus is that it is free. But the lectures should be more practical (not just the bullet points of the book), and the weekly assignment should not be a chapter summary question. The course developers should have taken the time to develop a case study for each topic, like in the first module in this spec. I highly recommend reviewing and improving the content.",1
This was my least favourite course in the the Creative Writing Specialisation. I learnt a bit about creating characters but I found the lessons bland and the assignments difficult to understand.,1
satisfactory,1
"Absolutely not apropriate for very beginners. Lacks explanation of ""why"" through all the videos, simply giving you information to remember ""If you do this, this will happen"". Such a structure of explanations doesn't give freedom in the future to do something different, as you don't get a general understanding of what you do.Additionally, all course is tought in Mac. Some commands are different for windows, and they were not even mentioned in the videos! I did not sign up for this course to be forced to spend hours in Google, trying to find how to do something, that supposed to be explained in the lesson.Overall, the course absolutely lacks attention to windows users and is not appropriate for absolute beginners.",1
i feel that the course need more explanation .. i got really lost in the begging of the HW,1
"overall: some weeks were fun, some notin some weeks are too many chapters and exercises. I actually think that the exercises are too complicated compared to the examples in the chapters. Sometimes are the explanations in the chapters not sufficient.It would be helpful to know the name of a proof e.g. Perch's Law or law of (the) excluded middle. This would help to find more information and help.",1
"Only the link agilemanifesto.org has real value in this course. The rest is self-PR and ""water"". I see no reason paying for the sertificate and I am not convinced further cources of this specialization will deliver greater value.",1
it's good but can be better they have to give more examples about the concept,1
a bit basic,1
Way too basic. Probably only suitable for absolute beginners.,1
"This course feels quite weak, especially for the paid course, for these reasons:Models (Leader as Mentor, Coach, etc..., CTFAR model), which are given in this course, are given as is, with no references on how they were developed, authorship, and how good the results of application are.Almost no (just one) external references for reading to better understanding course material.The amount of material (about 3 hours of video, 4 quizzes, 2 discussions and 1 assignment) doesn't feel like it's a month's course, more like a one/one-and-a-half week.No references on topics, described as ""hard"" during the course (for example, identifying your values), which would make this topics less ""hard"".No instructor interaction on the course forum (I don't know if this should be like this or not, but it still feels bad).However, the final assignment is good and practice oriented.",1
"It is a nice introduction, but the material is barely worth a one week orientation lesson (I have completed it in about 4 hours with watching all the videos, taking detailed notes, and completing the quizzes for 100%) . Why should we pay for a specialization preview, we can read info about the separate courses on our own? I am really looking forward the next courses in the specialization since I really need a good course in statistics and this seems to be one, but the first course should be eliminated. The installation of R and github account videos should be added to the next course as an introduction.",1
"We are given inadequate information in the videos, and no other resources, to write a program. Required to use methods not covered in the course.",1
"This course dedicates an entire week to very simple topics. The lectures could use some serious editing too. To help you understand what I expect, I'm taking this at the same time as I'm taking Wharton's Week 1 Entrepreneurship program. I've also taken Wharton's Intro to Marketing course which I highly suggest over this course. The quality is dramatically better. Getting Started: Agile Meets Design Thinking is a University of Virginia course that also is a great example of how these courses should be done. I'm hoping the next courses in the Digital Marketing Capstone are much better so that I'm not watching a lecture and counting how many times the professor pushes his glasses back up.On the plus side, I did like the engagement this course encourages by forcing you to go to other websites & accomplish things as well as review your peers work. I wish your peer reviews had less of an outcome on your grade though. In my experience, many people did not even read the instructions on how to review the assignments.",1
"Good lectures, but no exercises or assignments. Leaves a flat and unrealistic image of the subject.",1
Too much of common sense stuff and not much in the way of advanced techniques.,1
"I thought most of the discussions were ""____ needs to do this, _____ needs to learn to do this."" Yet doesn't provide a lot of concrete answers that helpful to solve x. And I understand some situations are complex with a lot of variables, but it seems as though a lot of ""environmental proponents"" just talk about stuff and don't give examples of what they are doing to change the world. I think Jadav Payeng (""the forest man of india"") has done more for the environment than all the attendees at all of these environmental conferences do. Courses like these highlight all the problems (and there are a fuck ton of problems) but contain fewer answers. So it just leaves the ""graduate"" overwhelmed and kind of spinning in a circle. I think I'd rather have a course that asks, why do we wear what we do when its made on the other side of the globe, is that the best for the environment? We need to wholesale changes in how we think about our society if we want it to be sustainable; not, we have problems over here and here and here, and if we put this bandaid on it, that might fix it for a while. I was just very unimpressed and skipped through the program as quickly as I could /rant",1
Interesting content but the bad English grammar makes it hard to get through and sometimes simply incomprehensible. I dropped the course after the second week because of this.,1
"This course is very short. I've completed it in about 4 hours. Nothing was told about linear algebra, statistics, optimization. It is not enough even to learn Data Science.",1
The course is good. But it does not has lecture slides that is better for students to understand.,1
"The material in this course is well presented, though scarce at times. However it has its share of problems :-little to no interaction from TA's or mentors in the forums-the quizzes are often out of sync with the lectures-the final exam has severe problems with questions (form not content).In more detail, on the final exam, some of the questions don't even contain all the content to answer them. They can request multiple answers but have single question boxes and/or the reverse.",1
R labs are too tedious for people with medical or science background! we need explanations rather than trying to figure it out on our own!,1
"The course is for an overview of many aspects of cybersecurity. There are many resources to read, videos that briefly discuss concepts of the week. Then there are quizzes and discussions with the topic of the week, doing the possibility at the student to talk about that and post his idea for assimilate concepts and reaching goals of the course. This is useful also for discuss with other students and how your ideas is viewed.I think there is a very basic course in his entire length, with more reading lectures at academic or professional level not for a beginner. it can be adding videos with more length and in-depth that in a easy way the ten domain about cybersecurity.",1
"Provides a comprehensive overview, however it is heavily lecture based. Would be nice if more interactivity was built in, via pop-up questions during the lectures and practice problems.",1
Uninspiring and boring.,1
"The videos and explanations are very poor. Most of the time the instructors are reading off a script, and everything feels fake. By reading off a script they are forced to ""hand-wave"" and do not explain concepts covered completely.The only thing I liked about this course were the problem sets, which were interesting to do. Will not buy rest of specialization, feels like this is just a cash cow for UCSD.",1
"Not enough implication from the instructors in the course. Students are left alone with the material, without any answers to there questions on the course.Peer review process subject to personal interpretation and leading to frustration for the students.That's quite unfortunate as this provides a bad experience whereas the course might have been good without that.",1
Too many generalities and roundabouts and little real detail.,1
"Much better Courses are available for free on udacity and edx. this is only a money making course. concepts used are very old. nothing new in this course. One can dwell in PID controllers for life, its a huge are and the way its used here is totally ancient. its just some ancient methods in new quadcopters.",1
"I will review this course appointing its pros and cons.Pros:- The instructor: he is a captivating person. It really seems that he like game development, he make jokes and try to make the course interesting. So, heâs personality is makes the course less boring.Cons:- The course name: when I saw âdesignâ?in the course name and the icon of course page, I thought it would be related to graphic design, or history telling and so on. But no, the âdesignâ?means âprojectâ? So I think a better name would be âPrinciples of Game Projectâ? Although, it might be just me who thought this way, because in my language design means something totally different.- The course content: this course should be at the end of the specialization. It is too much abstract and, in some aspects, very obvious. I will not say it is completely useless, because it is not. It gives us a structured view of the stages of game design and its documentation, but I think it would be better if it was like a case study.- The assignments: probably the worst part of the course. They very very complex, to be sincere, none of the assignments I reviewed were full, I gave max grades to many because I think the person tried really hard to make it. Imagine this situation: you are not a programmer, not a graphic designer, not a writer and with a week you need to make a prototype of the game idea youâve been working on course. This prototype must show the game mechanics and aesthetics, should be playableâ?And can be non digital? Come on, we are here learning the concepts of developments digital games and the instructor says that we can make a non digital prototype? Some people did it, and I can say for sure that I couldnât imagine the real game. I made a digital prototype using the knowledge acquired from the first course, but as you can imagine, it is not enough to make our game ideas come true.- The peer review system: the grading is completely non sense, as I said before, the assignments are complex, so it is difficult to show our ideas clearly in a document, without the abilities to make concept arts or something. In 2 of the 4 assignments 2 of the 3 people gave me max grades and 1 gave me bad grades, and did not left any feedback! One of the assignments when I first submitted it I got 12/20. Then, when I resubmitted it, without changing a comma, I got 20/20. So I think this system must change, maybe the mentor should do it.If you want to do all the specialization, ok, go and do this course. But, if this is not your objective, do not waste your time.",1
I was disappointed by this course. I thought it was poorly organized and focused too much on trivia and not enough on motivating and contextualizing Ancient Egyptian civilization. I was hoping to come away from this course with a richer understanding of Ancient Egypt. The lectures were surprisingly dry.,1
"Aside from a new interesting ideas (from a JFK speech and John Dewey), I found this course to be stretched pretty thin; I think this class would have been effective as a 2 or 3 week course instead of 9 weeks. Also, it was unclear why the focus was on CLASSICAL music, since so many examples come from other artforms (e.g., Ai Wei Wei) and I'm sure the discussions would be richer if they considered popular music as well.",1
Extremely superficial. The total content in this course would make a nice introduction segment to a full course.,1
"It is really not for beginners. The first week was ok , but we didn't spend much time coding. Then it was really difficult to follow.",1
Just showing examples of some good projects and their code at most part of the course .Also comparing Meteor with Wordpress is wrong and I don't think Meteor will reach Wordpress.After all they are different tools for different jobs.,2
"This course tries to address problems that might arise from game development. It's not an approach to the accounting problems, like finances, a game company may have, but mostly an approach to the bureaucratic problems of creating and publishing a game. It also provides knowledge about monetization pratices and publishing pratices, warning the future game developer how a publish may inadvertently ""throw a wrench in the works"" of game development.",2
"I have to admit that the professors know the topic and are conducting amazing research, but the course was dry and terribly designed. The videos are too long, without quizzes or activities to break the long dry monologues. They also talk like robots and one gets lost really fast. I have taken many courses in coursera with long and short videos, with boring and engaging teachers but this is by far the worse. They are trying to show off so much information and in such a high level language (to most), that it makes it incredibly boring. I should add that I have studied Buddhism, and there are so many better ways to provide people an opportunity to come into contact with this beautiful topic.",2
Some of the terminology doesn't seem congruent with what we use in North America,2
This course is way tooooooo easy for me. I'm a PhD candidate in statistics. I think it will be nice if I can have a diagnostic survey to test whether this course is suitable for me or not before the course.,2
The format and structure of this class needs some improvement. Having to write some code each weak would be better than answering quizzes and doing the first lines of Swift at the end of the class.,2
If you are new in the learning of business model generation is a choice to start with. But if you already have some experiencie this course is very very basic.,2
"The course covers a lot of interesting topics i a short time, citing external documents, webpages and books; sometimes some questions in the quiz refer to external documents.About the assignment: it start quite easy, about high concept, story bible, game design document, making the student write more and more detailed, focusing all the attention on the documents. Than, at week4, you need to create a prototype, digital or non-digital, based on your creations. I found this unexpected and really it's unrealistic to be able to create a decent prototype in the same amount of time given to write a document.About the grading system: to take the best score, you need to go ""epicly"" beyond the call of duty. I don't like that. A student should take the maximum score if he does everything required, and he/she does it good. No need to overdo in my opinion.About the quiz: if you make mistakes, he doesn't tell you what's wrong, he doesn't show you the right answer. It's not a problem of the Coursera platform, as in the previous course, the teacher filled the quiz with all the explaination of the correct and incorrect answers.So, should i suggest this course? Well the topics are interesting, they could have been transmitted better, with better assignments and grading score.",2
"It's great to understand more of research methods in application, but I wish there were more resources provided to supplement our study. In general, this is a good course for those who start thinking of doing research in the future",2
Needs to be updated. Also correct some errors.,2
Assignments were just not that challenging except first one,2
"the set up for the course was choppy, with random intervals of questions. could definitely flow better",2
"So the course is a mixed bag.PROS: The lecture content is useful, albeit a bit dry. I can't give them too much slack for the dryness, after all it's coding. However, they could have shown more real-time coding, rather than just scrolled through powerpoints with the Command Window pasted. You definitely need to have R open when following along with the lectures. The quizzes are also quite useful, as you're required to know both the background of how things work and use the commands learned from the lecture.CONS: The assignments assume you know a lot more than the basic knowledge, and there's no real way to know how to do the assignments just from the lectures. The quizzes tend to be on the easy side and the assignments ramp things up quite quickly. There's no intermediate material to test your skill. You have to have worked in R to have even a minor chance at succeeding on the assignments.",2
good overview of the subject.great for introduction to the domain and understand what and how...migth not be enough if you want to go deep into it,2
Some of the data that gets pulled in from the QSTK package is missing for the exercises. It takes a bit of work around to get to the final data set.,2
Very basic,2
"This was a good course, but a bit elementary.",2
Consider adding a programming assignment to the course curriculum. Please address content issues in a timely manner. Thank you.,2
"It was little difficult to understand what the professor , but anyway it was good.",2
the swirl exercise along with the course makes much more sense,2
"The course experience was a little bit weird. It's too easy for a dedicated programmer or IT person, but there are some obstacles to a person who are not familiar to the Javascript programming. (And maybe Python programming, too.) The main problem is too small community. I wrote some, but never got any answer. I think it's due to the charging policy of this lecture.",2
"Overall it was good. However, the content delivery could have been better.",2
"Good intro course, but that's all it is - an intro course. Expect great interviews and lecture videos, but don't expect too in-depth of a course. My review is biased because I already took Music Business Foundations from Berklee on Coursera and the material w",2
"The information presented was interesting, and the instructors were engaging. However, I had major issues with the translation. It was completely literal, and often translated in ways that did not make sense. If I did not have a working knowledge of academic French, I would have been lost. Also, many of the test questions were unclear and did not follow best practices in test taking.",2
The content is very similar to the Marketing analytics in practice one,2
Great course overall. However it does not go deep enough into its topic. Would have been nice to have more challenging excel exercices.,2
It does not let it show as completed unless you purchase the course and take the quizzes. Quizzes cannot be taken unless you purchase the course.,2
"This course gives a good introduction to international criminal law, showing in details the evolution of key principles and institutions. The readings , though details are a great resource for they keen to take deeper dives. The main concern , however is the sudden death approach that is used to evaluate the performance on the final examination. Preferably answers should not be binary, but provide the student with wide choice to gauge the degree to which performance on the exam truly measures knowledge acquired during the course (leaving little room for guess work, as it were).",2
Course can be more comprehensive.,2
I didn't know anything about programming and needed a lot of help with this course. I would have like more help in getting python and its complements install. Thanks.,2
The links provided are informative.,2
"This course provides a good overview about virtual instruction and online learning for those who are looking to transition from classroom teaching. The topics are broken down into manageable chunks and a few interviews with other people help to add interest. However, when I wanted to go back and reread for clarification, I found the transcript to be poorly edited and at times almost unintelligible. As an example: iNACOL (National Association for Online and Blended Learning) is referred to many times in the video lectures and was transcribed in the text in a number of different ways: ""Ian Nicole"", ""Inacles"" and ""iNickel."" I really wish the people who put this course together has taken the time to read and edit the transcripts of the video lectures. Many sentences were written without punctuation or contained misspelled words. (enrollment was spelled enrolment) Often I just wanted to read it the lecture, not hear the instructor's voice but found the written text to be less than clear. I also wish there had been a way to ask questions regarding the material, but unfortunately, there was not, not that I could find. Finally, some of the questions on the final quiz are confusing. For example, question #5 "" Which two of the following..."" and then in parentheses it says to check all that apply. I hope this feedback helps to point out some of the problems that hinder virtual instruction.",2
Basic intro to Python. But I found the content not to systematically organized....,2
"there is a wide gap between the videos, practice assignments and completing the required projects.",2
The last 2 lessons did not have much content. Particularly there was no practical assessment on traveling salesman,2
"I think this course could be integrated into the other ones of the specialization, or, if it is meant to be just a course to get an overview, be free of charge.",2
"More concise coding tutorials and less ""search on your own on the internet"" needed. It is great to get to know the online community and the course needs more coding example directly relat to exams.",2
"Some of the videos has low quality, which make them harder to understand for non native speakers. In my opinion there is also too less tips for second assessment.",2
"The topic of capstone is great, but the milestones, and their APIs direct towards bad solutions.",2
"I wish this course was more focused on building and analyzing data in excel. It feels like it's more focused on financial measurements and probability, it hasn't related to my line of work yet.",2
"I loved the non-UK / American basis for the writing and the study texts: fascinating reads and great eye openers to other styles and languages. Such a rich source! The videos and interviews were great and I loved the transcriptions - they made life so much easier to make notes and annotate from.The main issue I have is with the 'peer' marked work throughout the course. I feel this was meant to be a collaborative tool for us to use, but instead turned out to be a rather awkward device. Some students gave leeway to the 500 words limit; others not. I was failed because my explanatory note - not the piece itself, just a note for context - took me 34 words over. How pedantic was that reader? Another piece I read was over 2000 words long and had obviously been taken from some other assignment: it barely fit the study brief. Additionally, are non English speaking students penalised by having to write in English? Grammar and syntax in the west is very different depending on the country you come from - German syntax vs Italian vs English. All are different. How can I be fairly marked if the reader of my work has English as a second / third language? By that same token, can I really pass a student who has met the course criteria, yet has mis-spelled many words, has little or no punctuation and has jumbled tenses all over the place. This needs to be sorted out I feel, as it has marred this course for me. I don't feel it gave an even playing field to all. Thank you for the opportunity though, I did enjoy it!",2
Some of the lessons aren't clear enough to follow,2
Course is awesome but the final 36 questions are really a headache.,2
"I think its good that its given reference material for further readings, but this shouldn't exonerate you from explaining the details of the language, if I wanted to learn swift from apple's documentation I would be there right now, not here, if I'm watching your course its because I expect to learn it here.",2
"What was helpful to me was: the discussion on spaced repetition, which boosted my confidence in applications like Duolingo and Memrise, and helped me discover Anki. The pomodoro technique is nice to know about, though I have rarely used it so far. I think I was already at the point where I don't need an actual pomodoro timer to get into that mindset. The best two things I probably got from the course was changing my way of thinking from focusing on product to focusing on process (though not always possible of course), and using recall to test myself on what I know rather than reading things over and over and just hoping it's gone in.What I didn't like about the course was the presentation style, the pace, the content density (very low in my opinion), the irrelevant information, the hand-wavey explanations, and so on. The absolute worst of it was the full recommendation for using analogies but with no attempt on explaining how to make *good* anaologies. This is key. Most analogies I come across are misleading for all aspects of a thing but their very narrow scope, and sometimes the thing itself too (after all, you usually make them when you're first learning about a thing, unless you're teaching) and so without knowing how to make good anaologies while they are good for memory they are on average bad for understanding, and I don't think that can be stressed enough.",2
This Course is very Good For Children.,2
"Very helpful for people who are new to the field. However, I do wish many of the concepts were explained more clearly; often new concepts are introduced and no clear definition is given.",2
Good course,2
too easy and pretty long for me,2
Felt a little rudimentary until the last week. I hope the specialization picks up after this point.,2
Good start to the course. Though I feel more energy and enthusiasm by the instructors would uplift the course. Some content is not prevalent at present (outdated).,2
"I really enjoy the food preparation and the important facts about our body, about our food intake habits. thank u a lot Maya.",2
"Great topic, but the course was less interesting and profound than I expected. The professor could be a little more motivating. Worth the time though!",2
I rate this course as a three out of five because I feel that during the 'worked exercise videos' it would be much more helpful if only the correct code was shown. It's very confusing to see the wrong code typed in and then the correct code. I think it would help students to more easily remember the function of code if only the right code is shown in examples.,2
"Well presented, but this course should be optional in in the specialization. There isn't really enough material to justify it, but it does cover the basics for someone with little to no development experience.",2
"A good introduction to Workplace Communication.The resources supplied were extremely helpful.I didn't pay so much attention to the slides that came with this - in fact, I'm not even sure how relevant they are looking back.I had expected the overview videos to be an insight to the resource content, but it wasn't quite compiled that way.The tests could have been longer, and perhaps could have contained obvious solutions - in some instances the solutions provided were all applicable, leaving the student to select the best option. In other instances the options available weren't even discussed in the content, confusing the student.",2
"Good course with varied content and I very much liked the way it was build up (individual, business, cities, nations). Reason why I rated it 3 stars (only) is that the course was too easy - however I'm a sustainability professional. Maybe the word ""introduction"" can be taken into the title - as the course would serve as a good intro-course for practical application of sustainability.Geoffrey (The Netherlands)PS: the videos of the Parkers can be deleted from my point of view",2
"This was a really good course. I was mostly interested in the music and related culture, but I will be interested to read some of the books that were discussed. Thanks!",2
I think this class is best for academic people. I did not find what i was looking for.,2
Good foundation for the following classes.,2
"As a standard overview, the course is fine. However, the lecturer skirts around or hand waves away controversial or difficult subjects, and he's apparently afraid of offending anyone by getting too close to saying ""fuck"" or ""sex"" even in an academic setting. Additionally, this course won't introduce anyone to forgotten and erased artists of the past - women are largely absent from his history of rock, even though Janis Joplin and The Supremes didn't come out of nowhere. The quizzes are also too heavy on the trivia - ""who published what when"" questions rather than critical thinking questions about why or how.",2
"Very basic, the quizzes aren't clear enough",2
"The information is useful, but I think the five courses in the specialization could be merged into a single one.",2
"Very simple course instruction and materials with difficult programming assignments. I understand having a student stretch for an assignment, but this seems more like incomplete instruction. Definitely a lot of work if you only have a statistical programming background.",2
"It is a good course, but if you want to hand on the assignments, you have to pay. So I am a little disappointed.",2
"It was very dificul, i think yoou need to improve the example you give the the students and be more interactive",2
Very easy to understand!,2
"This course is more like a brief to ""how to design and launch a product into the market"" with a case study of an app targeting to aged population. I even felt like I was watching its commercial sometimes.",2
"Interesting subject & Basic idea to have a dog defined for the exercises is nice but w/o dog hard to benefit. A bit too much talking in front of a wall ;-) Could benefit from more illustrative material. Graphs / Videos / Pictures. Why not show examples of Dogs doing the games, that would be great for people who do not (yet) own a dog. I was hoping to get some insight into problematic dog behaviour but maybe that was wrong expectation.",2
"Very basic material, but a good introduction and a necessary step to ensure a baseline of knowledge for future courses in the data science specialization. I would only take this course if you are interested in the specialization otherwise save your money and google the info you need.",2
"A solid course, let down by quality issues in the last two modules. I hope these are fixed soon because it would make this a top notch course...",2
"Most interesting topic, previously unknown. excellent illustrations, although flashed up too fast. Poor, sometimes erratic and tiring verbal presentation, which sapped energy for peer reviews.Can be greatly improved.",2
"Fairly in-depth, but the lecture slides and examples have an antiquated feel and the testing involves very little other than simple recall (typically with examples already shown in the lecture slides). Evaluations should require more problem-solving and applying learned materials to new examples.",2
"Reading and only reading! Could have at least a voice, some interaction!And is too expensive.",2
"I think that the information for the assignments must be more clear, templates for the tasks needs revision.",2
"Course content is good, however instructions for the assignments are not complete. Often, instructions for the assignments that are required in the grading criteria are buried in the discussion forums, sometimes in multiple threads. And the method of grading is also only explained in the discussion forum. This can lead to the peer review grades being difficult to assign. The assignment pages should be updated to properly include ALL requirements and an explanation of how to grade the assignment.",2
"This is a five week course. While it was very informative, I would have preferred longer lectures and more material to read. I finished the 5 week course in 5 days - hence making me question the value of it. In saying that, I really did enjoy it and the professor was great!",2
"Assignments are very easy, and there aren't easy to follow notes that one can use instead of always having to watch the videos.",2
"The course gives a very high level overview of hardware security and does not go into particular details. Understandably, hardware labs are not included in this online course and the only practice is basic boolean and modular algebra.Quality of the media and transcripts can be improved. Sound is very low and noisy in some videos which makes it hard to watch on a mobile device. Some videos seems to be cut of too early and week's 6 videos are out of order, which is annoying.Overall it's an okay overview of the topic for someone who is unlikely to apply it at daily job (e.g. software engineer like myself).",2
"I feel like more examples, case studies, or panel interviews would help.",2
"He talks to0o00o fast and His slides are too wordy and I feel so sleepy When I was watching these videos! (I don't know why)!However As a PhD biomedical Eng, I'm learning alot from this specialization and I highly appreciate them for creating such amazing Idea. I'm Canadian and I know we have lots of similarities with you and I think I should make it for Canada and our university.Sincerely,Azadeh",2
"please rework in particular week 5, part 2",2
"A good course, giving a thorough understanding of the various types of renewable energy, their issues and opportunities. I cannot rate the course higher because some of it is so out of date. It really needs to be re-done. The Paris Agreement wasn't mentioned, some of the research is from the early 2000s, many of the lectures are at least 3 years old. This is an area that is changing rapidly, monthly, and this course can't really be seen to be current any more. Particularly the politics section in week 8.",2
The course should have more programming assignments than just having simple quizzes. And please update the language for SWIFT 3.,2
It's a bit hard to answer the quiz since the presentation is not speaking about the qu,2
Very helpful information particularly in the earlier weeks. I found the last couple weeks less helpful because of the large quantity of listed interventions without elaboration/examples - I did read the attached report but would have found it helpful to see some of the interventions demonstrated either via a video or diagram. Temple Grandin is a great documentary and I appreciated hearing her perspective regarding tactile sensitivity. She's also a great example of a person with autism who has developed her strengths and worked around her weaknesses and is a highly functional and successful individual. Overall enjoyed this class. Thanks!,2
The assignments were easy at the beginning but hard at the end.,2
The course material was very good but the assignments were boring and unchallenging,2
Too little information and too basic.,2
"I really enjoyed listening to the lectures. The instructors are very knowledgeable and explain topics well. The assignments are in line with the course material. This course encouraged me to think critically about mental health, specifically major depression from a public health perspective. The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because I didn't find that there was much discussion on the discussion board. Each student just answered the question proposed by the instructor and that was it. There wasn't much discussion back and forth among the students. Also, I think the lectures are from 2013 so I am wondering if this course is being updated and covering the most current research in public health?",2
"A good introductory course but it would have been nice to see a bit more of the math behind the models. I don't think the assessments were worth upgrading to the paid version of the course though. They were basically memorization and regurgitation directly from the lecture videos with very little, if any, thinking required. A bit disappointing from an institution like Wharton.",2
"While the lectures were good, this course had annoying issues, such as in-video questions asking us to refer to previously shown material (which isn't easy given the Coursera interface). A few assignment questions were also poorly formulated. The course would have really benefited from .pdf reference material, for review and elaboration of topics presented in lectures. At minimum, a list of relevant equations would have helped.The acoustics part of the content seemed somewhat sketchy and hand-wavy; the assumptions and limitations behind the rule-of-thumb equations and models presented weren't given much weight, so I wasn't able to get a good grasp of when they were relevant*. The electronics part was more reasonable, but still suffered from some over-simplification (for example, the model of guitar pickups didn't include magnetic hysteresis).All in all, the course was worth taking, but I think the material deserves more rigor.*All models are wrong. But some of them are useful.",2
"Good course but it's too much academic, I can see that you were talking things you don't understand or read a script without put any of your efforts.",2
A good overview of the landscape of of IOT.,2
"Good things:â?Simple, clear concepts that serve as a foundation for further study of finance.â?Many examples, repeated often to help gather basic ideas.â?A pace that is easy to follow.â?Friendly lecturer, even entertaining at times; which makes lessons fun to watch.â?Helpful and kind teaching assistants.Not so good things:â?Lessons alone don't teach you what you need; they don't even hint at some formulas that are necessary to pass the test.â?Because of that, expect to find surprising problems and ideas on tests. You'll need to spend a long time working on them, probably attempt multiple times, and definitely visit the fora to consult with others.â?Lack of assignments or already-solved exercises, similar to the ones used on the tests. There are only tests. Self-assessing assignments would be helpful to ""try"" the tests before actually attempting them.â?The course is actually 5 weeks long (not 6 as stated, since there's an ""empty"" week). I doubt that's useful as the staff claim (I simply skipped one week and continued normally).â?The professor insists repeatedly on a grandiose, philosophical, cheesy view of finance (how it'll make your life so much better, how it's applicable to so many aspects, how money isn't everything) but, in my opinion, betrays that spirit from day one by sticking to the most obvious applications and examples. He could, for example, show how these methods would apply to food supplies, barter, social prestige, trustworthiness, confidence in people or institutions, certainty about logic assertions, or other things that aren't measurable in dollars. He could use real-life examples (disastrous financial decisions in History, GDP of countries, international trade, loans taken by cities or countries, etc), and that would make it so much more engaging (I only remember one question about the price paid for the Manhattan island). He doesn't even use other currencies in examples nor tests.",2
I enjoyed the course material and the idea behind linking Buddhist concepts with psychology; I just found some of the videos a little dry.,2
Too much short for a vast and challenging topic like digital manufacturing.,2
"Thank you.With all my respect to authors, I skipped Parham again and found a few errors, for example statements like ""if bool == true"" and layout related errors in the ""starter"" app at the end of the course.",2
tricky concepts and long equations yet fun,2
This course was very helpful but there is a need to discuss it more further in details.,2
Arguments brought up are shallow,2
more needs to be taught in class. what is taught is not sufficient for quizzes.,2
"This course sets the stage for the rest of the Data Science specialisation.You get a lot of textbooks for free and they cover a lot of material.The quizzes are a little bit underwhelming, especially the first week. Too few questions, testing some questionable knowledge (eg, what other courses there are in the specialisation -- hardly a required tool in the data scientist's box).Overall, it's a good preparation for what is to come. It managed to whet my appetite for more , however I'm not sure the course is very useful on its own.",2
it is a little hard to student who not major in medicine,2
The course should have more details. It feels like a lot was skipped.,2
the homework is getting easy,2
"An ok introduction to Swift Programming, but I can see people who do not have previous development experience struggling with this course. Also lecturers were virtually nonexistent on the forums to help with questions which is disappointing since it is a paid course which implies you are paying for their time and effort not just the certificate.Best advice for people taking this course is to get through the material as early as possible and give yourself as much time as possible to work on the project, don't wait till the last week to work on it.Would also suggest the following changes to improve the course and help people understand the material better:1. Have a programming exercise to complete at the end of every week to prove you have understood the material taught, a quiz alone with 10 or less questions is not enough. The course ramps up way to quickly with the project if all you have been doing is following the videos, students should be practicing and proving they know the work far more often.2. Provide a clearer project brief since it was clear many people did not understand all the requirements.3. Provide a video of what the final project should do in general to make it even clearer.Overall I didn't have a bad experience with the course, just disappointed that it was really bear bones, there were too few opportunities to prove your understanding, it was poorly managed and the lack of interaction from the lecturers a massive problem when they are being paid to help out, not just provide videos and forget about the students.",2
"This was a fine overview however I was hoping to drill down into more detail on some of the roles and responsibilites data teams can have. For example data architects, stewards etc.",2
The course is very informative for those interested in data analytic and want to go for market research kind of jobs.,2
OK course. Difficult to follow at times. The assignments and reading make it worth taking.,2
Good stuff. I learned some useful techniques,2
"I would prefer to learn about less SMM tools more in depth, rather then getting to know so many just briefly. Felt a little bit overwhelmed.",2
More timely and relevant text material would have greatly helped in broadening our understanding. Basic and easy for beginners to grasp.,2
Very nice course but a shame you cannot do any of the quizzes without an upgrade to the payed track.,2
Real live scenarios of running a project would add a great deal to the course.,2
"A clear, if fairly basic, introduction. The lack of discussion forums makes it a fairly sterile experience.",2
"It has few content, should been more complete.",2
More theoretical. Analytical and Intuition is not much developed. Good for getting familiar with switch mode converter circuits.,2
ok course. nothing more,2
"Galaxy seems to me out of date. There are some useful information, however there are also some drawbacks, especially not clear criteria of assessment of final project .",2
"A lot of it wasn't comprehensible. Also, I may have not been well prepared for it. I should have tried to learn of the background required for this course.",2
"It is a very interesting course.The tasks are achievable and easy to follow.I do not understand how your final qualification depends on an activity qualified by fellow students, many of them, as the instructions read, are not fluent in English. How can they evaluate an activity written in such?",2
Pros:-Gives a brief overview of IoT ecosystem. Dr. Harris teaches complex things in an easy manner.Cons:-Assignments are not available for audit students. Request coursera to open assignments for audit students as well.,2
I was hoping for something a little more technical. This course might be good for someone who has no previous knowledge of the nutrition content of food or how to cook. It would be perfect for kids getting ready to head off to college who've never cooked for themselves.,2
"I would have been great to have more examples of the different types of corruption, the analysis to fight it and the solutions behind it. A case-study method I believe is optimal for this subject.",2
"Entertaining course, but only for those who are totally new to personal development and branding.",2
Good course. Bad arrangement!,2
"This course was mostly self learning. It gave me a framework to go along but what is presented in lecture and assignments are completely different. The discussion board and mentors are really good resources and can provide pointers to move along. It is definitely not a class that can provide sufficient information to learn and build applications, but the individual's effort in passing the quizzes and the projects will. It is up to the student to figure out through stack overflow, youtube, and other search result to figure out how to complete these assignments. I believe the assignments given from this class are realistic to real-world situations.",2
"Structured Course that gives beginner to intermediate level expertise. Short course, so there is not much time to give challenging assignments that would prepare you for a job or industry level skill in this topic. The student enrollment was limited (compared to my other courses on Coursera) and hence the discussion forum was not active. There is no TA or instructor participation in discussion forum; hence my advanced questions in forum (intended to learn beyond the course) went unanswered. You can learn this all on internet, but the instructor nicely covered 3 topics in 3 weeks, which is helpful.",2
"Great Instructor videos, bad assignments and peer grading system.""Is the file submitted as PDF? Rate from 1 to 5"" everyone puts 1 as my score even if I submitted it as PDF file, should be a yes or no question.",2
Very basic stuff!!,2
"Good course, but worth only for really basic learners.",2
Good but less depth than the rest of the specialization,2
"I enjoyed this course but I was not satisfied with the assessment.The content kept me engaged and highly motivated. I acquired some very specific and useful skills, which I developed by completing projects on topics of my choosing that were meaningful to me. I really liked Karl's casual and somewhat spontaneous style - this is a breath of fresh air from the video tutorials out there where lecturers are reading from prompts or reciting from memory.The biggest drawback to this course is that it relied completely on peer grading for the assessment (which you have to pay for). I don't think this assessment method was sufficiently designed to reduce the influence of graders who were overly subjective, hadn't sufficiently mastered the content themselves, or were disinterested in putting effort into the peer review. From now on, I will think twice about paying for any course where all of the assessment is based on how my classmates grade me. While peer review can be useful for learning, I don't think it's an accurate assessment tool. Especially if I'm paying to learn from a professional in a field, I'd expect to receive some feedback and assessment from that pro.Another area of improvement is that there were several instances where videos repeated things covered in previous videos. These things could be cleaned up a bit and the course would be more polished.",2
"This might be a great course for those who don't have any previous background in Finance/Business.The course will give you a very introductory observations about modern finance. Tests are quite simple, more suitable for high school, probably. No math required. That's a nonsense for a finance course, but still.",2
"If you've not read a single book on writing, this class might be good. Otherwise, don't expect to get much about the ~30 minutes of lecture.",2
Did not find it really helpful ...may be the way I expected it was different. Also may be because of my engineering approach towards management. I don't know...But thank you for putting this up and giving me a head start into innovative ideas for starting a new business.,2
"Could be less generic! The exemples are a little bit abstract, not much hands on or practical.",2
"Good frameworks that make a foundation. This course makes me realize selling is a critical skill. And Craig has done a great job at demystifying it. However, a lot of it is writing your own tool kits, assuming you already have successful sales experience. But that's what I realize I lack and that motivates me to take the course from the first place. If I had the right sales approach, then I would have been super successful already. Therefore, I would like to see more real examples that delve into the complexities of real-world selling situations. Also, Craig has an awesome personality: super high energy, very eager to engage; this makes me wonder the extent to which one's personality determines the effectiveness of the selling process. I, for one, am more of an introvert; so this begs the question if the introverts will need to do something differently to be as effective as the extroverts such as Craig. So, I encourage showcasing different approaches from already experienced salespeople from a wide range of personalities. In sum, I encourage the faculty to take this course to the next level by incorporating situational cases and how sales people of a wide range of personalities have handled difficult sales situations successfully, and/or how someone else have handled them unsuccessfully.",2
"Relevant and well organized material when looking at it, but in total it is way too thin. More tips and tricks about Xcode as a tool would have been nice. Some of the videos are pretty unrehearsed. One of the lecturers hesitates and stutters a lot.As for the final assignment. Being reviewed by only three persons is too few. One of my reviewers had problems with his Xcode environment and couldn't run my submission. Guess how he graded me. The other reviewers had no problems, luckily.There is almost no help to be found in the discussion forums, which seems pretty buggy. There are no TAs and the staff doesn't seem to be very active either.I'm sure the course will improve in the future. It's at the time of writing the only Swift/Xcode/iOS MOOC on Coursera.",2
"A example of the Capstone quiz, could made this course best. I suggest to give example of a business idea analysis and also lecture on it.",2
Too easy.,2
"Some parts were good but overall the course was lacking in its ability to add value. There were generic discussions. Week 3 was almost useless; had it not been for a good reading provided for an assignment, it was too basic.Add some specificity in the course or name it Basics of Research Methods.",2
"Useful steps for starting the specialisation, but should this really be a course that people are paying for? Come on guys. By the way, some R programming concepts could be introduced here and de-clutter the congested/crammed R programming course.",2
"I worked really hard on this course, but was stymied by a couple of quizzes. If I could not answer one question correctly, it meant I could not answer two or three of the next questions, meaning that I could not pass quiz. With no recourse, I was prevented from passing although my overall percentage of points earned was passing. I would still like to pass, as I feel that I really earned the certificate. I would really like a chance to speak to someone who can help me resolve my questions. My other problem was using one of the models, which I never could master, despite reading the help sites and trying two or more times.",2
The course was tough and was explained in a very fast way assuming that the student knows prior statistics.,2
Course content good but a little too basic in my eyes. I think the addition of more functions in SAS/Python would be useful. Having to do peer reviews is also not ideal.,2
"The course is excellent, but there is mistakes in quiz and the forum participation is null. Professor nor your staff reply the forums.",2
This course was quick and simple. I enjoyed the definitions and monetary examples. I would have more quizzes and harder questions.,2
Among my registered courses in the specialization this course is the one that should be invested with more effort from creators in order to give students more practical lessons. Regards.,2
"Too basic, if you're not completely unfamiliar to the subject.",2
"It's more or less a repetition of what you've learned in all the courses, tying four peer-reviewed assignments together into a somewhat contrived ""project"". Not bad, but doesn't really add much value to the courses before.",2
"It's a good course for those that are seeking to improve their grammar skills in English, but for me it sounded a little superficial and the peer review system for this course left space for some subjectivity.",2
The Teacher is not a communicator.,2
"It felt like there were a lot of jumps between basic statistical formulae and abstractions thereof. While I don't think it was inappropriate for a course on statistics in itself, it felt rather out of place in the rest of the sequence of this course.",2
Course material needs to updated to reflect current software updates.,2
"If you have Oracle installed from previous classes, there is very little setup required. If not, give yourself ample time to install/configure it. Assignments take MUCH longer than the quoted 30 minutes.",2
I had a good time learning new things which are generally not told in your academics.Thanks to UCI for offering it. Best wishes.,2
I think it would be good to include into course following topics:1) NoSQL databases2) ORMs,2
"This is a decent class, covering linear regression and a few of its variants in good detail. It's a challenging subject, but presented acceptably here.",2
"I found the course useful to better ground and assimilate the ideas presented in the first one.But on the other hand, as mentioned by other learners, I do find it a little too much on the commercial side.I did find very interesting to learn to use some of the tools such as Klout. I think that in time, and working in the Social Media department of a company, I would get the chance to see the interest of Lexalytics but I DID NOT understand anything related to Bluemix... I felt it was superfluous in this course.All in all, I did appreciate the course as it made me think more deeply about my goals, but I'm not entirely sure it was worth the â?1. I feel it could have been shortened a tad bit and go more to the point.I do look forward to the next course though as I am learning a great deal no matter what :)",2
"Pretty Simple stuff - but would've been better if there was actually something we worked on in a group, or an actual project to 'plan' or gantt chart to create.",2
"It is easy to follow, it should be a 2 week university course, but IMHO it should cover more about the data type problems that can arise with R loose data types. It is focusing too much on the code profile concept without leaving interesting knowledge about that. It should cover better the native idea/implementation about computation as single instruction multiple data, which is not well covered. In the end, this is one interesting aspect of the language that makes it useful for data science.",2
"I thought this was going to be a more comprehensive course about crowdsourcing and using social media to aid the design process. Maybe I missed something, but it fell a little short of the mark for me.",2
"Do this course for the assignments and to have something that keeps you on schedule. But be prepared to do your own research on topics.The professor goes off on pointless tangents forever. C is also supposed to be a prerequisite but then he ends also ends up explaining basic C (prefixing his explanation with you should know this). He then goes into these very specific, typical academic-style examples that he spends time talking about them (again pointless). And then very little time is left to explain the actual new C++ stuff, and he explains it assuming you kind-of know what he's talking about. So you'll have to stop the video and look up the topic online.",2
Marketing Analytics in theory was much more enriching than this one. It would be great if tutors can add practical examples to show how marketing analytics is actually performed it would have been great.,2
Good Course,2
"There was some really great information presented, but mixed in with tangential and unimportant sources (I don't care about the fashionable aspects of IoT!!)",2
"It is good course, but I would like it to be in the more material and details of Python.",2
"Course contents are rather deep which is good and makes it challenging. Explanations could be better and there should be more content on some topics for better understanding. Someone with background in statistics would find this course more useful than on who only has basic knowledge of statistics. Nevertheless, it inspired me to learn from other sources to fill the gaps in my understanding.",2
The quality of the course is not as I expected from a Coursera course.,2
"It gave a few good advices about learning and introduced some noteworthy concepts, but the videos became quite boring and repetetive after a while.",2
"While U.S. politics is important for many other disciplines, this course didn't have that much depth in my opinion to really be applicable on demands of international student and point of view. Still, very interesting lectures and good talks.",2
"It's OK, I think there's a few areas that could use some more depth of explanation. As with a few coursera courses there seems to be an assumption that students know the material being discussed and so it isn't explained. Most of the time in this unit that isn't the case but it does occur a bit.",2
"Few good ideas, too much repetition of the obvious.",2
Very few programming assignments..,2
"The course material was very interesting! The videos were a bit too lengthy, however.",2
Too basic.,2
"A whimsical introduction to game design and the springboard for a Specialization Certificate, therefore important to take.",2
"The course content was comprehensive, thorough and required note taking with preparation for quizzes. Solid academically.Some of the assignments required use of third party applications and websites that did function as anticipated or are no longer supported.Peer grading was very poor. It frequently seemed students did not read submissions, off handedly grading. At times comments did not match the scores, such as ""nice work,"" or ""good job,"" while giving only 3 stars.",2
"I did not enjoy this class. It was hard to take notes, the conversation from the instructors was to casual.",2
"Focused a little too much on telephone history, though some was interesting. Perhaps spread out to other modules as short background material.Would have preferred history/overview from Internet age with focus on various protocols/technologies that were introduced (IP, TCP, UDP, MQTT, Thread, Bluetooth, ZigbeeModule 6 made up for its more dynamic and more germane presentation. May be make it the 1st module, with other modules going back for a brief historical overview",2
"Introduced me to some cool ideas, web services and ideas for basic web design but isn't really a beginner course. I've switched over to a similar course from University of London.The lecturers in this course were very stiff and scripted and not overly simplistic in their explanations- something essential to avoid frustrating those of us just starting out. If you want a course that teaches you the basics from the true beginning but doesn't make you feel like you're an idiot for not understanding try Responsive Website Basics from the U of London & Goldsmiths.",2
Needs Improvement.Lecture and associated staff should participate more in the discussion forums.,2
"Good. Overall it is basic, speaker could talk faster and in general the course could move a lot faster. Room for improvement.",2
"Advantages:1) I liked the idea of filming the lectures of Dr Seligman in the real class. Watching his videos, I felt like I was sitting is the lecture room with other students.2) I also enjoyed watching different researchers talking about their fields of study. Inviting different speakers makes the course more diverse.Areas of improvement:1) Design. Some of the presentations in the videos were not in the style of the course (e.g. videos on constructive journalism)2) Structure. The overall impression is that different parts of the course were not reconciled with each other, leading to fragmentation of the course. It concerns not only design, but also video lenght (for example videos on constructive journalism were way too long) and lack of a sigle thread going through all the videos and supplementary materials. It seems that the course has been made in a hurry.",2
"The teacher seems to mainly read the slides and the tone is quite scholastic, not a lot or engagement. Indeed the course gives some info on the social background of doping, on how it is fought and it is adopted. Worth it if you have a strong interest in sports.",2
"Not really specific, just a broad indtroduction to data analysis.",2
"Content is really insightful, however, the instructor does not really dive into the details of most things. If you are paid learner, its better to get the whole specialization if you really want to get the gist of social media marketing.",2
"Very basic, very clear.",2
"I audited this course. The videos are in fact useful. However, it would appear that the real interaction is reserved for the later weeks of the course. Thus moving from theory to application can be a bit abstract. Of course I did purchase the book and workbook created by the author and have found them to have additional material to support application.",2
"The course gives an general theoretical overview about nutrition, but not goes further into details or practical example.",2
good to begin with!,2
"Although the information provided by the course is good, I do find it a bit difficult to listen to the videos. In truth, I typically read through the transcripts instead of watching them. I understand the the professor is attempting to provide an interesting and engaging experience, but I end up feeling as though I'm being talked to like I'm a child.",2
Completed it in a day but haven't read the recommended texts yet - which I will do. Some extremely interesting and thought-provoking material. Would have liked more than 3 weeks,2
leading to much sources which is really good enough to seek for more info in law.,2
not very creative in terms of approach,2
"It would help if there are case studies, practical examples.",2
"On a whole I am satisfied with he expanse of the course curriculum. However, I wished it covered certain in greater depth such as the Quantitative methods of Marketing Research. Also certain parts of the Consumer Behaviour section were quite repetitive.",2
"The course content is great. It gives overview on what is going to be learned in details in the next courses. Considering that it is an introductory course and the fact that it utilizes the GraphLab library as tool, I believe it is overpriced compared to the other courses of the specialization.",2
This is an inroductory cousre tou,3
Amazing style of teaching.. very impressed with Mr. Andrew Ng... Overall a very good course.. recommended to all Machine Learning aspirants..,3
I am very satisfied with the course.it was nice.,3
"This is a very good course, but I would have expected transcripts of the talks as well. I have done a few coursera courses and the supplementary materials here are minimal. Also, in the week 4, it is confusing to have the video transcript in the assigment section - very unclear whether that's a part of the assigment or not.",3
"Simple concepts, but it got me out of a rut and has improved my productivity.",3
I love this course :),3
A very good course for starting with python. If you already know something about programming this is perfect for starting knowing how wonderful is python.,3
Good & useful course but with some errors.,3
"It was very interesitng with great teachers, but for me (student of veterinary medicine) there was very little new.",3
It help me to get the basics of IOT and AR.,3
"Great introduction to functional programming, and you'll get to learn the basics of Scala at the same time. Some of the assignments have a bit cryptic descriptions.",3
"Quite basic and sometimes a little slow for coders with some experience, but well-structured and very interesting.",3
Need some extra work in order to get this certification.,3
It would be perfect if within the learning material is included in PDF files. The content is wonderful,3
it was a good course,3
Great course! The information was great. I enjoyed the format and the instructor was great.,3
Very useful for amateur learners. Thank a lot University of California!!,3
"Coming in as a veteran coder of 2 decades, I thought this would be ""easy"". And, had I completed it using my own C/Python code, it probably would have. However I made the decision to stick with ONLY the command line tools and actually ended up learning a lot more about basic unix tools that I rarely get to use.Be prepared to knuckle down and REALLY learn a lot about the specific commands and what they provide as there are a ton of them. The instructor goes into a ton of detail on each one and the course is laid out in a nice flow starting with the basics and ending with a very challenging exam at the end that showcases an entire RNA-seq technique.With a bit more polish, it would be 5 stars, but as it stands there is a bit rough around the edges.I think this course should be #2 in the specialization as the underlying concepts of RNA-seq and how the tools fit together would have been invaluable while taking the current #2 course on Galaxy. I think that I can now go back and get 100% on the final project armed with the RNA-seq techniques that were not originally covered in my first run through the Galaxy content.",3
"The course did an excellent job of providing a broad overview of mountains, from many interesting and important perspectives. So it was completely successful in its primary goal as a 101 course. I also really enjoyed the map section. It was a good decision to bring in different experts to add variety to the videos.Some constructive feedback:The quiz questions need some polish, in particular, the ""select all that apply"" questions. Also, because Coursera randomizes the order of answers, some choices like ""all of the above"" simply do not work.The course notes could easily be improved with some nicer formatting. They also do not always cover every question on the quiz, which would be nice for students who want to revisit parts they got wrong or didn't feel solid on.I believe that the tech tips will only be useful for a very small number of viewers. The idea of a quick tip on a related topic to the week's lesson probably sounded great, but the end result was far too superficial to be of any use. For example, instead of listing various navigation equipment and telling viewers to practice before heading out, it would have been more helpful to just pick one and give pointers on how to use it correctly.The sections of video where David is talking with an expert are very awkward. I know it's surprisingly hard to pull off, but those scenes really should have been rewritten when it was clear how wooden the interaction was. The question and answers are very unnatural, and the slow walking toward the camera is so clearly contrived as to be distracting. At the very least, fade the scene in with them already walking, rather than have a beat with them just standing still before starting their next take.That last point isn't a big deal, of course. Students didn't take the course to see great acting. And in general, the videos were good enough. But the production values can only slip so much before flaws begin calling attention to themselves and begin to distract from the material. Maybe one final point on the videos; Zac, was generally able to read the script more naturally, but David's earnestness endeared him to me more.As I said at the top, I think Mountains 101 largely succeeded at what it set out to do, and I am glad I took it. Some polish on a few areas would have improved my experience somewhat, but even as is, I would recommend this course to others. Thanks for doing it! I can only imagine how many hours on the script and in front of the greenscreen David and Zac must have spent.",3
It's more based on people that knows marketing!!,3
Great survey of dairy operations,3
"The course was ok, but at times too much theoretical when it comes to proofs of some methods are working as expected. I think its good to know the principles of parallelizing application and changing the potential algorithms, but this has applicability only in specific fields like comlex computations that need to be highly parallelized and less likely you would use these principles in standard backend development",3
Course is very interesting but i think the videos are very short. Better to make longer videos,3
"The course work is easy to follow, full of great information and very clear. The only thing I find inconsistent is the reviewing of others work. It seems no-one ever gets reviewed by the same person twice, which means the standard of reviews is varied and inconsistent. Also, many people may not be/feel qualified enough to review or feel bad about failing someone so wont. There can be a great deal learned by having mentors or qualified teachers review the work. Given that, I have learned a great deal in this course and understand, and think it's one of the best online courses I've seen. I also understand you get out what you put in. Thanks for the opportunity.",3
I feel like 8 weeks was too short and the project was too rushed. But overall of good value.,3
"The quality of the content is excellent and is presented clearly (although the lecturer drinking various things throughout the lectures was odd...). I plowed through all seven weeks in a day because I had already finished the first three weeks of the Rice University Python course (also on Coursera); I would say this entire course is nearly equivalent to the first three weeks of the Rice course. My reasons for doing this are two-fold: (1) practice, practice, practice, and (2) I plan to take all four courses in this series from U Mich - I am interested in the web and database aspects that do not seem to be covered in the Rice course. I did learn a thing or two from each course that was not presented in the other, but those points were relatively minor and would probably be stumbled across on a future troubleshooting visit to stackoverflow.",3
"I am an engineer with no background in law, but found it rather easy to follow Prof Gearey as he neatly unravelled the hidden logic of a complex, amorphous subject. The lectures build on the topic from first principles and the quizzes are well designed. I am hooked on the subject and am ready to tackle some of the more difficult subjects.",3
swirl is very used in this course. It is one of the best tools to learn R,3
Good introductory course.,3
"This is a great course, I learnt a lot, and I must say I had to put in a lot of work for this course, and it had extra things to consider, like create SMART goals with action and resource plan, and using the prioritisation matrix, and ranking. Thanks for a great course",3
a very clear an simple lecturer,3
"This is a fun course. However, there is not much content on dog emotion, and lots on evolution (not limited to dogs). It is straightforward and slowly enough paced that no one should be afraid it will be too difficult for them, and the instructor is enthusiastic and eloquent. I have a PhD in a related field and I learned quite a bit, so I would recommend this course to others.",3
Powerful practical strategies delivered in a comfortable fashion. Bravo!,3
Good intro to the topic. I suggest reading the suggested books and blogs to fully appreciate it.,3
"Very great intro to the 3 main languages of web design. I feel it has given me a solid foundation with which to keeping building this skill set. Some parts, particularly Jquery moved too fast for me, and I had trouble grasping/retaining the jquery rules.",3
Good Introduction for beginners,3
I've learned a lot about emergent phenomena on this course.,3
"I would have liked to get input on my work by an instructor instead of just other students, but it was a good exercise to hone my skills. I wouldn't pay for credit because I feel like my work isn't being professionally graded.",3
Good course but overpriced in comparison to other offerings on Coursera which are more comprehensive and cheaper.,3
"Great course, very inspir",3
This is a wonderful Course to understand the Basics of SEO. A person who don't know anything about SEO can learn many things. (Not recommended for those who have good understanding of SEO Basics before),3
Thanks for this course it is very useful.,3
"Course material quality is unequal throughout the lecture. It does seem that some parts were taken from another class and were copy-pasted into this class. Anyhow, very good class overall, the homeworks are really good and well prepared. Thanks for putting online such a great class !",3
Nice introduction to the subject and I'm just taking one point off for the organisation of the material presented.,3
Excellent and concise. Thanks a lot.,3
Great info on accessing data from multiple sources. Also some excellent teaching on relevant R code modules.,3
"Can move too quickly at times, but is very informative. I have learned more than I expected in a short period of time.",3
Very useful,3
Great insight on Private Equity!,3
Excellent as per usual. Was just hoping for a little bit more detail on lightroom post-processing,3
"Good course, simple and easy to comprehend",3
"A short course, but I did come away with a better understanding of how materials behave at a molecular/atomic level. I already had some experience with semiconductor physics and some of the basic chemistry ideas. The deformation curve helped me cement how/why torque specs are developed and used. The eutectic and eutectoid explanations were also very helpful.",3
"Good course, learned a lot especially through the quizzes and the course project, but slides/presentations could be more engaging.",3
Good structure of this course. I did this course and was reading Python for informatics book together. Gave me good platform to start doing more advance things to do in Python.,3
"Thanks for overview of experimental methods and references to relevant articles!""Complete the essay"" quizzes looks like a joke",3
"I really enjoyed the course. It was a very good introduction to a lot of topics in machine learning. The quizes and assignments were manageable but not too easy.However, there were no written course materials to print out. Thats the reason I only rate the course 4 stars.",3
"MUY BUENA HERRAMIENTA, ME PARECE ESENCIAL, MUY CLARA PARA SER ENTENDIDA POR CUALQUIER PERSONA",3
"I Love this course, and I need more reviewing from you",3
The course was beneficial to me and I learned a lot of new things. I took one star because of the assessment of students who are too poorly evaluated.,3
"Really solid analysis from Trump's top economic advisor. I point that out as a warning before you start, but it was really and truly a useful and well-taught course. I highly recommend it. Best to come into the course with some level of background in economics, but Prof. Navarro breaks things down well in the videos.",3
"Useful introductory course. Assignments are helpful, though it sometimes also gets quite mathematical.",3
Great course ! Some assignments were not that easy and required time to be achieved. Enjoyed it !,3
"simple, lucid and organized instruction. great for beginners",3
Meetings is one of the most useful courses for all professionals.,3
Very good information but the videos could be a bit more exciting.,3
Definitely worthwhile for the content-- a bit difficult to follow due to the professor.,3
"Great course, Great Instructor, Definitely Great Knowledge! Thank you so much.",3
Nice approach to manage chronic pain,3
This course presents many alternatives to traditional models of business.,3
good course.,3
Useful and interesting,3
"This is a basic overview of security issues and user input for web sites, etc. It focuses on design, usability and other issues that affect how people interact with security log-in and other issues.It's a good foundation for looking at your or other's work and knowing the best way for the computer to interact with a user.",3
"Great class, I wish there was ""practice it"" with the algorithms to more familiarize yourself.",3
A very good course on Algorithms.,3
Demanding but very enlightening course,3
"A great course! Challenging, relevant, and every concept used is clearly explained.",3
"Very informative and explained in a simple, understandable manner.",3
this program is very intersting and informative to me.,3
A good Introduction to 3D printing.,3
Great overviez on Hardware Security,3
Good course especially for those involved in business strategy. It requires attention and a lot of quizzes to be solved. Nonetheless all information shared by the professor can be useful and a knowledge advantage. This course can be taken by people who aren't familiar with business/finance/economics.,3
Good course for those desiring to develop conception about research design. Students outside the purview of social sciences can find it a bit difficult.A few more examples in each module could perhaps be of further help. Overall an excellent course.,3
Good for the beginners to programming,3
nice things to do and good examples.,3
"Overall, very good course. The only thing keeping this from being a 5-star course is the lack of resources around comparing completed programming assignments.",3
"I enjoyed this course and learning, specifically how to adapt a healthier diet and the evolution of food in the US. The videos were interesting and the information was insightful and applicable to daily life. The only thing I might change in the course is having the professor incorporate definitions to some of the terms (i.e. nutrient dense, , metabolic abnormalities) in the videos, or as a supplemental document.I would recommend this course to others.",3
"Luc de Brabandiere is a highly passionate, motivating speaker, who brought me new perspectives on my job and everyday perceptions.",3
It is a very informative course! Well taught .,3
"Even that I have studied Machine Learning before at college, you can get a little bit lost in the Maths, parameters and matrix sizes.Documentation with some theory and the equations would help a lot",3
Excellent technique to clear up basics of programming and how the code works at the system level.,3
Good start in the PRJ Management world,3
"Good course, comprehensively covering key concepts involved in Web development. Although It does not touch server side development, but provides foundation to pursue advanced courses in web development and design. Thanks Coursera.",3
"I thought the course was very interesting and the videos were great. One criticism I have, though, is that the name of the course is misleading; it really should have been called Educational Reform in the US. I don't think we studied specifically urban issues at all.",3
"I like very much the course, I recommend it. I would have liked learned more MATLAB parallel to the course.",3
Very usefull,3
"This is an excellent introductory course to computer programming. It gives you all the opportunities to learn at your own pace.It is not too difficult to clear the capstone itself, but the course gives you the opportunity to chose your own project which makes it all the more interesting.",3
"Not as good as the first two courses from the specialization, but still good",3
good course,3
good concepts,3
"This was a great course, and I espesially liked the last bonus video. The creaters have grosely underestimateed how much time you are going to use on week 4 though (about scoping). For those of us who does these courses in our work time, that makes it really hard to plan the day.",3
"This course provides a very good introduction to basic linear regression, including simple multiple linear regression, model building and interpretation, model diagnostics, and application in R.",3
A solid but gentle introduction,3
"(Beta-Test review)Status: Still on the first week.The content is an easy follow, though it might seem to be a slight difficulty for those without a heavy background in calculus. So far, all the links (to the downloadable csv's and ipynb files) work well. All the videos have no apparent bugs and/or problems. I would also suggest to have the slides available for download as in the previous module.I don't think writing over the animation is a bad thing as long as it's still understandable.As an aside, I suggest editing out the swallowing sound you might occasionally hear whenever either instructor is speaking. To some, it seems a bit off-putting.Great course, overall.Thanks,Marvin",3
Great course !!!,3
Like the first course of the Game Design and Development specialization. Brian Win teaches nice concept and then let us go in implementation right away. You will learn a lot of Unity stuff addition to the first course.,3
"I am absolutely delighted to have had the opportunity to study the fundamentals of music theory from a prestigious university such as The University of Edinburgh for free online. I extend my most sincere gratitude to Coursera and the professors teaching the course for making this possible. The course makes it very easy to build knowledge going from week to week. The assignments are all challenging. In this way this course encourages studying to understand the concepts. I have attended the course as a beginner in music theory, having encountered only some very elementary concepts earlier. I have found all the teachers to be very pleasant and very clear in their explanations. I have given 4 stars to this course because I would have liked to learn more from the professors on some topics which were very briefly mentioned. Some of the courses have external links to Wikipedia instead of a more clear explanation. This are however the exception and not the rule. The majority of the course is well taught and presented.",3
+: I reached my goal for the course and now I understand a bit about R. I succeeded to pass within much shorter time than anticipated course duration. The course certificate is posted to my Linkedin profile.-: No human mentors on the course discussion forum - all questions answered by other students. Automatic tests in swirl are too restrictive and do not accept perfectly correct student solutions slightly different to those anticipated by the authors. Week 2 assignment is much different from the reading material. Nothing taught about charting in R.Overall comment: I think it is good value for money.,3
Capstone provided an opportunity to make use of various concepts learnt during the specialization. The level of course coverage and difficulty level was moderate,3
Very good course.,3
Good Course! Helps to get the basic concept of Functional Programming.,3
"Great insight into conducting for people at all levels. It's invaluable as a musician to have as many skills up your sleeve as possible and that's what this course helps with. The video lessons are quite long, but the multiple choice quizzes more than make up for that where other courses have little content and lots of complicated technology requests for submitting assignments. Perfect!",3
"Final assignment is targeted at people who have the power and authority to make large decisions or try these methods on projects, which may not always be the case. Otherwise excellent materials and good video lectures. Found the information very useful, and I actively recommend this course to others.",3
An informative and well-run course. I has never really thought about project management in such a concrete and analytical way.,3
It would be better if there was more tests.,3
So much information beautifully presented!,3
This is a great course,3
"excellent course would love to see more on early crocodilians and turtles, I know turtles have a debated history but would be awesome to look at possible origins.",3
"I enjoyed the instructor teaching but the video and interviews, but not those with Guido van Rossum, were not very interesting and had nothing to do with Python.",3
Comes in very handy when you want to improve you English fast.,3
cool,3
The crash course was easy to understand. The classes used good examples to give you visual details about the subject and the instructors were clear and precise.,3
helpful,3
"A good continuation of Think Again I. However, final quiz had lots of bugs in it.",3
"This wasn't as easy to understand as the HTML and CSS classes. I think it's because it wasn't as clear to me what JavaScript was and how it affected the computer. It sort of felt like jumping into something I couldn't wrap my brain around. That said, I still learned a lot and enjoyed the videos.",3
relatively easy,3
Very Simple... Very Interesting... Clear and simple examples...Very good for refreshing with very basics.,3
"I found the information useful, good introductory course. However, not as challenging as I had hoped.",3
Very clear explanations and right to the point.,3
It was a great experience. This course help me understand the components of financial statements,3
One of the better programming classes. Definitely recommended.,3
"IT is a brief course regarding Robotics, but adequate. It leave lots of room to understand. But provide enough to dig deeper into the Areal robotics. I am able to grasp the course work and work along with the pace set by instructor. All in all it was a good 5 weeks worth of lecture and hands on to simulations.",3
investing class with ideas i hadn't considered prior to taking the course.,3
good insights and ways to avoid problems in building and importantly advertising your team,3
Very much explanatory and easily understandable.,3
"More coding exercises, as optional for example, would be nice. Otherwise good course and guide videos.",3
"A very enjoyable introduction to proofs, number theory, and some real analysis.",3
Wonderful course. Got to learn many things.,3
"The metrics introduce is broad, but it helps you with the idea of how businesses function in this modern world. We were also introduced to theoretical business for which an attention to business metrics is important. It is good for those who have a technical quantitative background, but no business background.",3
The assignment grader is not good enough,3
"Great way to learn about subtleties of working with global teams around the world and excel in these environments. As well, the details and how to leverage the power of crow",3
"The Course was well suited for beginners and explained pretty useful concepts, but I think materials of week 3 need to be polished more.",3
"loved it,really helpful for my project",3
pretty good and specific!,3
"The course was great for the most part. The material was more challenging than previous courses in the specialization and really helped me pull everything together and understand everything a bit better. I will say that I felt there was a huge gap between what was taught in the Neo4j course and the Neo4j assignment in the Capstone. I'd learned a lot from the assignment, but it took me loads of time and their were parts I still don't really understand. There are also a some broken hyperlinks to previous course material. I'd also like to see better support for a paid service. There is no interaction from a Coursera employee or course instructor in the forums at all. It would be nice to have someone to clarify some instruction or material that may not be clear at times.",3
Dr Wentzlaff is an excellent instructor and explains the material very well. Homework and tests are well designed: the questions are fair and they help you further your understanding of the material.Only complaint is that some of the lecture video had out-of-sync audio which was distracting.Thank you Dr.Wentzlaff and staff!,3
"Well Done!It was my first mooc in Chinese, content was interesting, and example were useful (I liked the exemples with the dow jones).As I tried to follow using Python 3.6, I had difficulties with GUI compatibility and some evolution in SciPy",3
"This course was informative, light-hearted, and brief. Prof. Barbara Oakley shows enthusiasm and spirit, which livens up the material. Prof. Terrence Sejnowski is less fluid in front of the camera, but his scientific knowledge--the precise explanation of how Oakley's concepts work--is uncanny. I would love to see professors Oakley and Sejnowski produce an even more polished version of this course. I learned a lot and raced through the lectured thru sheer enjoyment.",3
Extremely innovative exercises and guidelines. Really opens one s brain to think creatively. The intructions for assignments need a bit more clarification.A worthy ue of hard earned money.Thanks Coursera,3
Easy and complete,3
I love it!,3
"The material is explained really well, and there are many concepts that are introduced that it helps set a good foundation in OOP. The project is pre-built which is the only thing that I didn't enjoy a lot, I would have preferred starting everything from scratch as I think it would help cement the stuff learnt even more.",3
Great course!Cons: too java oriented.,3
I think it is so useful for everyone who need to improve there productivity,3
Nice course that enhance my skills,3
I enjoyed this course it was fast and easy to do my only complaint is that when you submit your final project it is a little complicated to send but other than that this course is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to learn this skill as well.,3
awesome this only world i have . i have learned great,3
"Good science, great explanations, simple recipes with tips and advice. Strongly recommended to people with little/no cooking and/or science backgrounds - especially new university students and parents. However, I would not consider the professor (she is a doctor though) a skilled chef - while her recipes are great and simple, the techniques she uses are perhaps not the best, given that she is conducting a course that's nearly 20% cooking demonstrations. I would strongly suggest consulting a Jamie Oliver book/video, or Michael Smith to augment this course.TL'DR: Great science and explanations, good recipes, could have used better cooking techniques. Good for uni students/healthy eaters.",3
"A nice one indeed , felt good being challenged ...I will continue to study ,",3
"This course have improve my understanding on auditing, fraud investigation and others.",3
pretty good but very time consuming,3
Punctuation overwights grammar in this course.,3
"The course content covers a lot of topics related to practical cost estimation and cost control and the presenters did a good job in relating theory to real life experience examples and they were very engaging.The downside was with the test and quiz questions, there where several errors to what the questions asked in relation to what the actual answers where intended. All the quiz/test section needs an entire overhauled and a detailed reviewed should be undertaking to correct all the questions in relation to the provided answers.",3
I like the course.,3
I appreciate the video vignettes and e-enactments as part of the instruction. Many are tongue-in-cheek (on purpose) and enliven the learning process.,3
"Great course, but I think It could be more vivid like its predecessor",3
"This course was very knowledgeable but it didn't hads anything to use in practice, no coding and only theory. However it was very good.",3
Very good in setting up for the next courses. I would like to see more on Git though because I could have definitely understood it a bit better,3
well-defined process overview,3
"I did learn a lot from this course, i know where to find the resource to solve my questions.",3
Good one :),3
"This was the most helpful online course that I have ever participated in and I'd like to say that I'm honored and really happy about the new theory, which I have learned throughout the lessons.I really like the fact that you don't have peer assessed assignments, because I find them very time consuming and not helpful. Also every lesson was really well structured and easy to understand. The fact that almost each of them was shot during a real class is another plus for me, because when I have attended other courses most of the tutors just read and you can see their eyes moving while they are doing it and it really destroys my concentration.Something which I would like was to have more part of the book maybe. If you are afraid that a student might afterwards upload it in some torrent site you can build some platform where one wouldn't be able to download but only to read a certain document. I would have liked to receive the whole book like that and more written files.",3
Good chance for learners to indulge more practically than just theoretical work.,3
is good for person who do not have a knowledge about finances,3
"The Broad Fundamental Basics that everyone should know. The course was effective in convening the must know-hows and how to adequately implement them. I was expecting the course to be slightly more challenging, however I already have legal know how, so apart from that, its a worth while investment in ones life that can be applied in and for any organisation.",3
"This course offers very useful tools and topics that would lead you to improve your time management and at the same time introduce you to a more productive work environment.It is a bit short and I think that it could go deeper on its content, offering other tools in time tracking and visualization.I definitely recommend this course.",3
I finished the course and I think the course is a great first view of what engineering mechanics can offer to the students at the university. I am a mechanical engineer newly graduated at UFRGS and the course was a great experience to recall some of the content learned at the university.,3
Overall good class--instructor is lively and engaging,3
"Great course delivery and loved the extra videos, however as an experienced java developer I found the course too basic.",3
Would've liked more on the truth table of the conditional.,3
"The course was great, it was really interesting and fun. But the final exam was somewhat lackluster, writing it was not even close to enjoyable",3
Very informative lecture and Brian explained concepts pretty well. Thanks..,3
"Great course! I wish I could take a regular semester class, but good job with the amount of material included within this class. I'm looking forward to learning more from this specialty.",3
Excellent intro to python. I learned the basics and I believe that future classes can enhance my execution of Python for data science.,3
loved most of the information. totally loved the recipes and really hope that my grandchildren will,3
"There could have been more content and the course been more challenging, otherwise loved it!",3
"the cousre is wonderful and practical. However, would be more practical as soon as you provide a list of tool that are popular for marketer in digital planning either in a template form or in a case study.",3
"A challenging introduction, goes fast but gives you what you need to get through. I learned a lot.",3
Interesting and well presented. I enjoyed it very much!,3
"Great course, well-constructed and very informative.",3
"Short, but pretty good; very clear and concise lessons, understandable for beginners or intermediate learners.",3
very helpful!,3
Great for learning python basics,3
Excellent - but I wish that the course had tougher assignments to really push me to practice on the topic - although I admit this is hard to grade.,3
"I strongly recommend this course, it is very well explained. very engaging.",3
"I would add some ""flexgrid"" to the course, aside bootstrap.",3
"Lots of great reference information available in this course that is constantly being updated. The course forces you to finish your project so at the end of the course you have something done which is a 16 panel comic. Doing a cover for your small comic book is optional.It was fun to do for me. I'd give it 4.5 stars if it would allow such scoring. My only complaint is that the course seemed rushed and too short for all that you need to cover and create in some weeks.I still would not hesitate to recommend this course because it is complete. All that is necessary is some very basic supplies. Photoshop may be needed to complete the final week, but I worked around that issue as I think some others in the course may have done as well.",3
This was a very useful course in the specialization.,3
"Simple and useful ideas and practices. helps you to understand why your learning has NOT always been successful in the past, and provides excellent pointers on how to learn and retain what you have learnt.",3
more or lesss... :( I don't want to pay for pass my quiz,3
"Gives a great foundational overview of what Data Science is, as well as getting your technical environment set up for the future classes in the Data Science Specialization path.",3
Great course. The videos and the reading are very well done.,4
It is a good class!,4
I strongly recommend taking this course! Very informative.,4
"I loved how the courses assumes no previous knowledge, and allows for a slow build of coding know how. I especially enjoyed the examples that I could code along with in IDLE. I don't pretend to understand coding after this course, however think that it is a could foundation for f",4
This course is excellent. I learned English in school but forget it over time. I found this course an excellent source to revise my English writing skills.,4
This course was very important for my work. I learned so much and I want to say thanks to the professors.,4
Great intro to python.,4
Great explanations and very good assignments.,4

Amazing course - very deep and at the same time very general picture of our big history. Thank you very much for this great course,4
A great introduction to Project Management. Clear and concise.,4
An excellent and very well structured course that can significantly improve your improvisation skills. Highly recommended.,4
"Very well made course. The lecture are fun and not boring at all!It's a very good introduction, and the main takeaway is that you'll learn why and how to negotiate fair.For a beginner in negotiation, this course lays a very good foundation, and opens the eyes, broadens the view on what negociation really is meant to be.",4
worth your time and effort. some mathematical background required but professor Larry makes it very easy to understand the intuition behind the fo,4
Absolutely wonderful. I learned a huge amount and Giacomo was a very friendly and helpful teacher.,4
"Really debating between 5 and 3:5 for awesome material and great instructors on the videos3 for lack of slides on all the courses of the series and lack of TAs. All the other courses I've taken on Coursera and other platforms always had tremendous TA assistance, not here! Here there is a good student community as usually, but no feedback from professors and no TAs assigned. This is really a big miss.UPDATE: Thanks to the team dedication!Now slides are added to this course and Influencing people! 5 star course.",4
great course,4
"Great course, interesting and challenging!",4
Good course to familiarize yourself with cancer biology.,4
Great introduction to Python and programming. Very accessible for everybody.,4
Simple and Great! Thank you!,4
"Dr. Everly's lectures are the best in Coursera so far, in my opinion. PFA is a course that will help millions in those first moments in despair, distress or panic around the world. I strongly recommend it.",4
such a great class. The class aim to give beginners a really nice and easy start so the students who are new to programming will not be intimated or frustrated. The professor is very funny and knowledgeable and make the whole class great fun. I really enjoyed the class and ready to finish the class and move on to the 2nd Python serie class.,4
"I have enjoyed Learning this course, its very informative and I will recommend this course, the tutor is very informative.",4
This is my first Coursera course.. The designer makes the course easy to follow and fun to learn. Thanks Dr. Chuck for a great job.,4

Great course!! Easy to understand and learn a lot from it!,4
"Excellent teachers, course and specialization.",4
"If you are surrounded by music, live, breath and love the music business; this course is for you. I write my own material and work with all my music responsibilities and this course helped a lot with the different aspects of music and what goes behind the scenes and beyond the artist. This course clarify lots of questions I had regarding the business side of music. Prof. Kellogg speaks about all the little terms and big words use in the business and breaks them down in small bite of knowledge that become easy to comprehend. Thanks, Berklee College of Music and Coursera for this great course.",4
Best Course for Machine Learning,4
Great nutshell info about all you need to know in most common wireless networks !,4
"It was a very fun and insightful course, would recommend to anyone looking to improve their learning effectiveness",4
thank you,4
Excellent! This course provides a comprehensive overview of the subject matter that is as valuable as it is engaging.,4
Very informational.,4
Very good class,4
Fantastic teacher!,4
Very good course!,4
the way it should be.,4
"The teacher is very comprehensive and very serious. I was starting to learn Java, thanks.",4
"I so much enjoyed this java tutorial class. The design of each clip/module is very humane and best for the learning from scratch. I have finished this class and the one after it (array list one). I feel very confident about learning Java language and I am heading for the next one (software design principal). I plan to finish all of the 5 courses and then buy the certificate so I will be sure I am not waste my tuition. I am leaving the 1st class (CSS, html) for the last one before capstone because it seems not so relevant to SDE training but more frontend/UI.",4

"Great course to introduce non-professionals/beginners into major fields or topics of philosophy. Excellent quality of lessons: teachers were always good to understand, even for non-native speakers, and eager to get across main themes to disciples inexperienced in philosophical studies. Only critique: difficulty levels of exams could have been more evenly balanced.I can only recommend this course to anyone interested in the study of philosophy; great job by the University of Edinburgh and its staff for organizing this on Coursera.",4
"I graduated eight years ago and never took the FE. After some pressure at work I decided to take it, but I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a review course. After completing this course and doing the practice exam, I was able to pass the FE on the first try. This review course is very good because the topics which are discussed are discussed in detail. I would also recommend getting a review manual that goes over all the possible topics. I had a number of questions on engineering economics. Thank you to the professor for providing this wonderful course.",4
