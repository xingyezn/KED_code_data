"waste of time. except for git and github ,nothing much is in it.",0
Professor needs to emphasize on basics before going advance.,0
"Presenter is very bad lecturer. She seems to be reading (badly) from a tele prompt, rather than lecturing. The quality of the slides is very poor. Not the level of a reputable University.",0
"The videos are too short, without enough information about the topics. You have to read a lot, Actually, this course doesn't look like as others Coursera's courses and I don't recommend it.",0
The teachers there do not do what they teach: they rattle down their text as fast as they can speak and do not emphasize the content with movement or even change of expression. I was disappointed.,0
"Disappointing, thought it would be more involved, perhaps with a real presentation graded by other participants in the course. Was interesting to watch the videos, but it was a 10 minute job. The other parts were OK, but after the Capstone I would hesitate to recommend the course.",0
"It is like for kids, I think all courses must mention their target audience. Contents, Videos, talks nothing was value for time.",0
Filled with redundant balderdash and extremely dumbed-down and slow-paced. Offends the learner.,0
"This was not really a course, but a person talking in front of camera some jibber jabber and not much to learn from these talks at all. If this was a way for Kimberley to increase her brand presence it did not go well. Talks were short with no real matter in them fill with jokes just to make time with them. I am sorry I did wait until the last lecture hoping that something will come out of it.",0
To be honest I don't think this is worth the money.,0
"I am afraid this is going to be a rather negative review. Having completed over 10 Coursera courses over the year, and numerous other online classes, this is officially the worst. For me personally, the whole course was a complete waste of time. Put it simply, the presenter can't teach, at least not the MOOCs. There were no structure. The instructions were all over the place, and explanations were inadequate. After drumming how important to actually ""code"", he proceeded to present the whole lecture showing small pieces of codes.... on slides. After touting how cool and useful Sublime is as a developer tool, he didn't even use it. After telling everyone how useful regular expression is but not part of this course (so he won't explain), he went on to use regular expressions for all the sample codes for the rest of the lecture. As mentioned, there was no structure as to how he present Ruby/Rails as a programming platform. It was bits of code here, bits of code there. Beside getting a feel of what Ruby syntax is like, there was no learning. I am aware there are suggested readings, but then why doing this MOOC at all.As I check out other courses from the same Ruby specialization, the student numbers are getting smaller. Hardly everyone post on the forums, I also check the Classmates map. I suspect many simply gave up since the Intro classes were so bad. It's really not hard to find better material to learn Ruby/Rails, even just slightly better, even YouTube videos. I am frustrated at myself for putting in the effort (really try) and wasted days. I am leaving this course and unlikely to sign up any MOOC from the same team again.",0
"The highest video production values of any class I've seen on Coursera so far. Unfortunately, that's the best part of the class; the support is simply nonexistent (a post by someone associated with the staff from a previous run of the course suggests getting help troubleshooting Python from Coursera staff), the instructions for the class software are out of date, the source material for the assignments is sometimes unsuitable to the task you're asked to perform (e.g. statistical analysis on a data set aggregated from disparate sources), and the pretty videos are at times completely unrelated to the actual assignments (the very first week with the literature review). Dropping this specialization like a hot coal; it looked quite promising, but the aggravation over the poor organization and lack of support considerably outweighs anything I could get out of it.",0
"Story telling module, not really useful for IOT purpose.",0
Really not good. I am trying to find out how to un enroll,0
Description of assignment questions is not clear. The expected answer from the questions are confusing.,0
"Disappointing. Just brushed the surface of most of the topics, felt a bit too much like an ad for PWC or story telling about client engagements. Content was lacking",0
"For me, this course was disappointing. Here is why: First, the level, at which the course material is presented, is very low. It might be freshman level, but certainly not more. There are many buzzwords but no real explanations. The programming assignments are only doable because most of the work has been done by the people designing the assignments. There is very little left for the students. Furthermore, the procedures, that are already given, are not very well documented. Hence, a lot of guess work is required to figure out how things should work. Furthermore, little effort has been spent to structure the procedures that are already given. Altogether, this makes doing the programming assignments very unsatisfying.Finally, the professor presenting the materials does not take part in the discussion forums. Contrary to other courses that I have attended at Coursera, this time the discussion forum was no help at all.",0
I'm sorely disappointed. I learned almost nothing valuable and found the content to be so basic that I didn't get a good feel for Tableau. I paid $20 elsewhere (UDEMY) and I'm learning a SHIT TON about Tableau through them. Tableau has great free resources too that are better than what I paid $80 for on Coursera. This class is a joke and not worth $80. As a UCD Alumni I'm embarrassed my school's name is on this.,0
too many grading errors.,0
"Nothing new to learn here, this is very dull in contrast to other courses of this spec. I gave up watching the videos after a while and try to pass anyway. Too bad this is part of this spec, I wish Marco or Matthew taught this course too. This course is very hard to follow and not interactive at all. It should take the students through examples, live examples the student can do too, and things the student builds from scratch. This does nothing like that.DON'T take this course if you aren't after the specialisation certificate. It's not worth the time and effort.Too bad this spec includes this course, it shouldn't be here.",0
It's not a course... this is a very short general introduction to 3D Printing,0
"Uninspiring teacher, repetitive material that could have been consolidated with month 2 altogether.Did most of my learning from the supplemental readings.",0
Not recommend. Very basic and videos are only 2 - 3 minutes.,0
No factual tools !,0
Very bogus and boring content. The monotonous voice gets me!,0
Nothing interesting. Common information about nothing. Sorry,0
"If you didn't like the first few lectures, you won't like the rest. It won't get better. More repetition, clichÃ©s, and advertisement that anything else.",0
This is real boring I just learned that,0
"Not even sure it worth one star, all due respect.",0
Very elementary coursework. Quizzes were too simple while I expected some challenging questions that'll make you think. Please improve the assignment quality.,0
Very disappointing!!!!!!!too much emphasis on mathematical notations....where are the practical applications?lack of examples....it seemed more of a prose than a lecture....would not recommend to a beginner.Period,0
"I do not like this course. There are far too many prejudicial ideas - even in the first unit. A language does not have to be used by a single / unified group to define it as a language. Esperanto is a perfectly valid language, fully capable of expression, and does not belong to a single / unified group. There are no native speakers, either - which does not rob it of the fact that there are winners of the Nobel Prize for literature who write in it. The things you are saying about language are not merely willfully ignorant, they are highly offensive & prejudicial. I cannot conscience supporting a course like this.",0
"This course is actual for Mac machine, all instruction are for Mac only. I use Windows so it unuseful for me.",0
"Although the content is good, the course itself does not reflect in any way what a good asynchronous course should be. Where is the discussion board? How can one communicate with the instructor or with other classmates? Although peer review of an assignment is one aspect of asynchronous and synchronous education, said assignment should also be reviewed by an instructor, especially when said instruction carries so much weight. In addition, I think overall the tests are unfair. I was marked wrong twice for a question that asked my opinion! Also, in the ""check all that apply"" questions, if one misses one of the answers, the whole question is marked wrong. Finally, many of the test questions themselves are irrelevant to the content of the course. One last thing- the course says it's a five week program, but there are only 4 weeks. Something needs to be adjusted.",0
The first three weeks assigments were way too easy and the answers could be found in the material.The last assignment was very poorly described and the material was very limited in explaining OOP. That meant it took a lot of time figuring out what exactly was needed to complete the assignment and how to do it.Disappointing after a great first course. Hoping the next will be better.,0
To be honest I don't think this is worth the money.,0
"Answers to week 2 are wrong, no forum to discuss it, submitted a case over a month ago - still no reply.",0
Less useful than reading an introductory chapter. Being able to reiterate acronyms or idiosyncratic mnemonics does not demonstrate any real understanding of this field. The minimal information provided and low level of the instruction at least clarified that this specialization is not worth pursuing.,0
All assignments giving you more insight on your personality had to be purchased. I did not really feel like a free course .... too,0
"That person should not teach. Nobody. The person is not able to construct a sentence without denial and course has really little information, but lots of empty talking.",0
"It is too hard to understand what he is saying, his accent is impossible to follow. Besides, the lectures are not dynamic, it is just him reading the slides with the most monotonous and boring voice ever. I took the first course of the specialization with David and this is the complete opposite. I would love to see the whole 5 courses with David and not only the first one.",0
starting from week2 the way of explaining the materials isnt good,0
"I love the main lecture of the statistics. The Subject is fun. After couple lecture, my mind was very clear.But most of the time I'm working on the statistics software name R. I think it would be better if require R knowledge. If not, student like me will need more than weeks to get use to R. I don't mean learn another software is bad idea. I will always like to learn something new. That's why I go MOOC. What I mean is R and Basic Statistics should be separated. First R, than Basic Statistic. Or first Basic Statistic than R.I really enjoy the class. but the extra is a bit heavy for me.",0
Not happy about course 5 & 6 got cancelled.,0
"Requires MATLAB. In my view, a university should not be promoting a proprietary product. There have been other Cousera courses which used Octave, the free-software implementation of the programming language implemented by MATLAB.I have seen no good reason why Octave should not have been used for this course.",0
"As a person who actually studied physics and knows a little about data science, I am literally baffled the way information presented and lectures speak. Really don't recommend this cource at all. because Week 1 materals is a imcomprehenisble mess full of incorrect explanation and vague definitions.",0
"I don't know what happened but it seems they had technical or some other problem while preparing this course. Some assignments were more oriented to solving marginal problems then using Spark and distributed and parallel computing. And that is really annoying. Previous 3 courses were great, maybe this one will improve.",0
nothing new,0
"Complete waste of time. This should be a course on its own, and much less be charged for. This should have been the 1st week of an actual class. This only dealt with installing a couple of software tools. Hopefully the following courses will teach something worthwhile.",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE - THE guy who reads (not teaches) the course, Justin-Nicholas Toytama is horrendous. He's too lazy to even type out the codes and has the world's most monotonous voice.He pauses often to read this notes and has 0 enthusiasm teaching this class. If this class is not part of the certificate specialization, i wouldn't even pay for this course. $64 gets you further with Nick Walter or Rob Percival's Udemy course.",0
"I did all four courses - the whole specialization. Each course in itself was aright and I learned new things. However, the course certificate is meaningless. It neither states the content nor the effort (for example the hours). Instead, it even says ""non-credit course"". This is despite the fact that the course equates ""35 PDU's"" and ""counts towards the UCI Project Management Certificate Programm""; as it was described in the FAQ. I feel betrayed. How can I apply with such a meaningless peace of paper anywhere?",0
Hated the course and the content. I truly regret investing my money on this course.,0
not very well organized.,0
The intro video just really put me off. sorry!,0
"The title of this course is Paradoxes of War. One of the paradoxes is how little paradox there is in war, after reviewing and reflecting on the lectures and the reading materials.",0
"This course totally reminds me of some courses back in college: unorganized material and the assignments are unrelated to the tutorial. The assignments themselves seem to be very helpful but the tutorials did no help of achieving these assignments.I had a hard time following the instructor despite that I've completed all the certificate for python from University of Michigan. I'm aware of my background of python is still not strong enough so I thought it's probably just me not able to learn it fast enough.But then I watched the tutorial about SQL. As a data architect / ETL developer, SQL is something I'm familiar with and use it everyday and then I realized that the instructor couldn't explain a nested query well. The reason I was able to understand about the SQL part is because I already know.",0
Use of Duke own specialised librarie ~ not the best way of learning progamming for the real world.,0
"If I can understand all of these derivatives, why shall I attend your course? It is not helpful course, especially for persons looking for some practical econometrics applications rather than focusing on the mathematics side of it.",0
"Very very bad communication from the teachers. The 2nd MOOC was supposed to start I think 2.5 months ago, it did not start at the time of this review.They did not even bother to post some announcement to let the students know : ok course starts in x months.Making things worse, you cannot get a refund if you purchased the entire thing.",0
"Actually i want rate 0, as the instruction for the installation of new tools are quite vague and misleading",0
"Capstone exercises were very ambiguous, the students were left to interpret they way they had to finish and how they rated their peers.The peer reviews were poor with little to no feedback and the focus was on how the material was laid out vs what the content was.I have done other coursers and capstones in Coursera this was one of the poorest. UIUC has to revamp this. More guidance to students in the instructions would be the first step.",0
Completely irrelevant material.,0
it was halful,0
"I have always been appreciative of free courses that are provided by universities, but this course is clearly biased. The sophistry present in the final module is particularly dishonest. A university is meant to teach the whole story, and have a truthful account of facts. I am deeply disappointed that so much fallacious content could be distributed to individuals, on the pretext of unbiased learning. This course clearly has an agenda. I hope those who take it think critically about the subject matter and do their best to weed out what is reasonable and what is not.",0
One could learn as much from any of many texts. This course does not add value,0
"Poor quality and heavily outdated content. Video quizzes were broken more often than not. Module Quizzes questions and answers were vague and poorly constructed resulting in choosing incorrect answers.Reading material was of poor quality with many ""industry professionals"" not being professional enough to perform a simple spelling and grammar check.",0
"The professor teaches by reading the slides and does not even bother to explain the concepts. The course contents might be interesting, but now I'm dropping this course because they are not explaining any concepts but are just giving facts to memorize.",0
This is only theory related to the evolution of the systems. How their features change over the time.I personally think that it is useless because you really do not learn anything.,0
waste of time and money,0
Very boring. Not many real life advices. Mstly theory,0
A poor end to a poor Coursera specializations.,0
No practical knowledge learnd and no clear examples of the topics. Too complex all the course,0
I quit this course as it does not live up to the specialization which it begins. JavaScript is not Java. The course description should clearly state that JavaScript will be taught and that it will be used to draw boxes of different colors. I was extremely let down by this course.,0
WoW awful presentation but great instructor. I expected much more than this but :(Leveraging employer brand is not compelete :\,0
Would have liked to do the assignments if they weren't all locked by payment requirements,0
"Not clear illustrationï¼?many problems are not directly related to the content covered. More importantly, it sucks!",0
Inaccuracies and low level of engagement.,0
The worst Coursera course I have taken. Total waste of time. The lectures are boring and have no real content. The supplementary materials are good though.,0
"Avoid this course like the plague. Terribly taught, no support, problems only vaguely related to the course material, and designed to force you to buy the manual for the course. The next classes in the specialization get even worse, with the student forums full of students who can't get any help though the grueling process of installing Oracle, Pentaho, etc. on a personal laptop. I was fortunate to have experience with the tools, would have never managed to finish the course just based on the terribly taught material.",0
The instructors are not well prepared for the course. The material are not well structured.,0
"The videos are fine. But, It's SIMPLY TERRIBLE to force people to pay to be able to do the quizzes. There was no such a thing in the first two courses (by the way, I gave high rates for both). It is OK to pay for the verified certificate, however, disabling the functions in the course is a wrong way to earn money, because people who want to learn the course might not necessarily want the certificate, and this is unfair to them because it limits the resources available. This whole Specialization thing starts to make me feel like you guys are in urgent need of money, rather benefiting the community. Remember there are tons of free resources on the internet, and this only undermines your strengths. You will lose tons of potential fans. Stop being seemingly arrogant.",0
Not worth wasting your time over: they state that which is blatantly obvious and provide little insight into human factors of security.,0
Too theorical and bold course,0
This course and material does not articulate the 'Google Cloud Platform' offerings. Maybe Google does not want to compete with Microsoft Azure and AWS alike. If Google itself has approved this 'Google Cloud Platform' trainings on Coursera then vola I am out. I am way better off supporting AWS and Azure (at least they have tons of good trainings and stuff to keep folks in the field excited).,0
i dont know why quizzes are locked even though I'm enrolled in this course and already done watching all videos in it.,0
This course mostly about how to use plotting libraries in R.,0
Too theoretical.,0
"If you don't speak Chinese it's a terrible course...The lectures are recorded from lectures at university and the rhythm is very slow and not very well explained (at least the first week). The transcriptions into English are incomplete, so understand this course is very very complicated.I do not recommend it at all.",0
There is a wide gap between the lectures and the practice. Its clear that the video material is completely inadequate and insufficient for the course. A poor introduction to programming.,0
low-level content for people with no teaching background,0
I dislike this course because I have to complete so many assignment in one week. Instructions could have improved and slides could have improved rather than using chalkboard. Sorry there are a number of times I have to rewatch the videos and still dont understand. Hence I even have to place myself in another slot because I could not finish the assignment. Please improve on this module so that it is more enjoyable for learners who really want to learn. Thank you.,0
"The course are fantastic but 3 month HARD WORKING to earn a ""cheap"" certificate that looks false :( I cannot present it to my company",0
The high video production values of this course fail to hide the abysmal lack of content. With approximately 4 mins per week of video charging $49 for this course is a disgrace. Potential students should save their money and read the relevant Wikipedia pages.,0
Too many obvious things.,0
"The lectures are unpolished and hard to follow, especially as the captions are inaccurate. The mathematics in the course are not explained clearly.",0
"Wordy, dirge like. The topic is interesting but the exposition is so boring - the reading of a lecture outline - that I'd rather study on my own 8-(",0
"This course is way too slow and boring. I am disappointed I have paid so much for so few content here. Why a full specialisation cycle when one or two courses would probably have been more than enough ? Too much distraction as well, with ""funny"" videos that I had to pay for...",0
This class is taught a terrible pace and is very old-school in it's thinking. It was pretty painful to get through actually,0
"This was the most arduous undertaking I have ever been through. My frustration is not with professor Wobbrock, who is obviously an expert in his field (though sometimes I felt like he's speaking in ""High Valyrian"" and not English). My disappointment lies with UCSD which included the course of such depth of information and a strong requirement for understanding R, without much thought on whether students will be able to follow. I feel that going through this course was largely pointless, because I'm not going to retain much of the depth of the material in the long run.Based solely on this experience, I'm NOT going to be recommending this specialization to anyone.",0
"The course gives some ideas about time management. However, it takes more time utilising these methods of planning, checking the plans, planning extra work and risks than actually do the work.It is impossible to multitask, let's go back to monotask.",0
I would like the course to be more dynamic.,1
"Personally felt this course have a lot more potential. The explanations in the lectures felt very robotic especially when describing the scripts. At times the lectures slides felt like displaying the subtitles and reading off them. A lot more diagrams could have been illustrated for explanations. I have to watch other videos in youtube to get a better grasp of the concepts.Good thing is that this is an introductory course, and the codes are given.",1
"Very disjointed and no clear progression. While it teaches the basic syntactic rules well enough, the functionality of R is explored in an ad hoc manner where the assignments have little to no relation to the week's lecture.",1
"I felt like the test-candidate for a new course. While the course-work and the presentations itsself were excellent, the ""homework"" was a real pain as very often the Auto-grader didn't work and it took me hours to get a project which was correct, to be accepted as the right solution. Cannot recommend it to be honest unless they improve their systems. Also it was said that the other course specialization start soon but it seems they don't and I paid for the full package....",1
The course was very generic and didn't teach that much. Sorry.,1
"Morely designed on slideshows, not effective.",1
"The programming exercises should not be optional. I still intend to do them, but now I passed the course with a 100% mark but only 10% of knowledge.",1
Poor concepts exposition with a bad teaching method.,1
Does not teach Excel very well while tryng to apply the basic usage instruction to not too difficult problems. The ability to interface with Excel after some knowledge of Python/R or other programming languages would be helpful in the Data Science programming that is increasingly being promoted.,1
"a little propagandist, but interesting with that in mind",1
The weeks 1 and 2 are really good!!!! The weeks 3 and 4 are going to fast and the things that are teached are not connectes with each other well. So its impossible to do the assignment 3 and assignment 4 has nothing to do with what is tought in week 4,1
too easy,1
"Interresting, but too easy to understand. Not much details. Very easy course, but you won't learn a lot.",1
"I liked the content that was presented. There was some really good advice, like the importance of being disciplined in sticking to the algorithm you have designed. Unfortunately there was no detail at all about how to backtest, where to get data for backtesting, where to find research papers upon which to base an algorithm, etc. In other words, everything was kept at a very abstract level, and not enough detail was provided to actually do anything.",1
a bit too simple to be a paid course,1
The videos didn't work correctly (sound and subtitles). I suggest to fix the problems because it is hard to understand the content of the course if the problems reamin.,1
boring assignments,1
"Good video lectures, pointless assignments .",1
"The videos and documents are not balanced with the quizzes. The quiz questions are sometimes verbatim sentences from one book with a missing word - which I find hardly a test of acquired knowledge. The course must rise above only a few definitions and rough concepts. Most of the video's hardly offer insights - they last only 2 minutes and cover a few of those definitions. This course has a lot of potential, but in its current format and content it was a disappointment.",1
"I am not impressed with this course so far. The quizzes and assignments are out of order with the materials being presented - the questions on each come from readings and lecture content that have not been introduced to the audience at that particular point in the course. The first module was a very, very basic outline of a generic analysis process, and really has nothing to do with digital marketing analytics in particular.",1
"While this course might be suitable for somebody new to this topic, it was not very useful for me. I have read numerous articles on the topic, so it brought me nothing new.",1
"The content of the course is extremely useful, however assignments need review as the exercises results have mistakes and they are not explained very well (missing step by step guidance).",1
"The only thing I had to do in this course regarding the required assignments was to change python 2.7 code to 3.4 as that's what I'm using.Presentations didn't add much towards the learning either. Definite downgrade from previous courses, especially from the first three.",1
"This course is ""1-dimensional"" and not of high didactic quality. I have followed several other courses ( also Python in Coursera set up) and this one really disappointed me ( I'm in wk 2 out of 4 now). It is a bit of a pitty that the instructor speaks too rapid ( it is ment to be also for non-native US speakers?). The material is hardly explained step by step. So what I do at the moment: I watch the video and than go to Yuotube to find other videos that deal with the topics in an easier and didactic better way.Examples of good cousres in my opinion are stats and probabilty course/ and the python coursePS ""all of the data toolbox"" course seem to have the same flaws.Of course my knowledge level is low concerning programming ( I am a MD, so hardly scientific educated...). Nevertheless I hope this feedback can be of any good.",1
This course was clearly not ready. The autograder for the final project was.. a complete fail. It was not a fun experience trying to change around my code to figure out what the autograder wanted.,1
Module about codecs was great.The rest was too easy. An equivalent to reading manual on internet. No value added :(.,1
"Excellent lectures, let down by the difficulty of the assignments.While the tutors clearly know their stuff, I found the assignments really quite challenging and of limited educational value due to the mixture of new concepts introduced by the lectures along with new (to me) mathematics or CS that also needed to be grasped.I'm an experienced professional programmer with the EPFL 'FP in Scala' and FRP courses under my belt, so I thought I knew what to expect but this was much more time consuming than I'd thought.",1
"Sweet and short course. However, if you dont have Adobe Ilustrator nor plan to buy the Certification, it is a little bit too short and basic.",1
too many information just to be said.,1
Too far from subject,1
"No material to read, Javascript is way more than just 10 hours. even for a jump start.this course needs more material and more practice.",1
"Too much ppt and theory, while little examples and real code",1
Course lacks real example and full of theory. It lacks steps of what actually needs to be done to achieve SEO.,1
"Too basic, this should just be a read",1
Provides a very summary overview of a very important aspect of data analysis. Expected more!,1
"The project at the end requires actions that data scientists should know but does not actually talk about the items. For example the project ""book"". You hear about it but are not actually taught the right way to make one. At best case you are taking a guess and at worst you are learning bad habits or missing out on what should be in it.",1
"This course is the first one in the Data Science series to lapse in terms of the clarity of the lectures, and the sense of cohesiveness of the material. Brian Caffo's lectures in Statistical Inference were good; in this course they seem to veer left and right rather than get straight to the essence of whatever subject he is lecturing about.A more structured final project would have been helpful. The instructions on this project weren't quite so blunt as to say ""Take this data set, do some regression-y stuff and come back with something about these two variables,"" but that's basically as far as our instructions went. It could have been a great learning experience to have a more detailed guide through the construction of a regression analysis, but instead an assignment which was 40% of our grade was put together as an afterthought. It was the assignment equivalent of stopping in the 7-11 a block away from a birthday party to buy a card.Also, in terms of delivering the content: Mr. Caffo needs to structure his slide/video arrangements so that he is not standing in front of the text. Think of it from the point of view of somebody wanting to listen and read at the same time.",1
Very rushed presentation. Blows right through a lot of fundamental concepts without a deep enough explanation or enough practice material (especially in the last two weeks). I feel like completing this class will require supplementation with better instruction.,1
"Errors in the material made it difficult to get through. All past discussions on the forum are gone, making it difficult to review posts by classmates.",1
The presenter in this course is hard to follow and does not have good slides. She often does not put her bullet points or lists on the slides ( I am a visual learner and she does not provide enough on screen info) She is really uncomfortable and makes it really hard to listen to her talk. She struggles through the entire presentation which is just super distracting. Content is good though.,1
The course is not well constricted to guide students.. it's only fill the gaps.,1
Very basic. Tricky quiz questions. There seems to be multiple right answers.,1
"This course is rather bad, not well rehearsed and hastily delivered. Especially in comparison with other, in-depth course of this Specialization. The course is more of a 'caret' package review then actual Machine Learning. I learned how to use the",1
This course is doable if you have prior knowledge of probability and statistics. This is not for beginners and should therefore by reclassified as intermediate and above. I am sorry I enrolled in this course. I have truly hit a brick wall and can go no further...,1
"Undoubtedly the course instructor is very knowledgeable. However I did not take away as much from this course as I would like to. It is mostly theoretical; very limited examples. I also missed the bio in biostatistics. A title like ""Mathematical Statistical theory boot camp"" would be better suited. I believe having a set of cases that get reused in some form over all lectures would be very beneficial for -at lease mine- understanding the topics. The form of lecturing is not using the benefits that an online platform offers. So instead of short interactive videos, this has slides with lengthy essential spoken word with it; hardly summaries.",1
"Very essential topics, but the instructor's delivery of content is inconsistent, glosses over explanations at time, ""umms and arrrs"" a lot, talks extremely fast at times. Making this course quite hard to follow.Disclosure: English if my first language. Not new to programming. Not new to MOOC courses.",1
I would recommend the coursera online training session need more improvement. Please look at this youtube video. this will give you some fair idea what do i mean.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0AWyzVMf54During the session speaker need to be visible on top corner and they need to present with more examples during learning this will help and learn fast.I struggled a bit following your videos going back-and-forth with the given materials.I also struggled solving the assignment due to confusing questions. Not much clear what is required to solve the problem. it would be helpful to provide some hints for each assignment.,1
Unrelated and incohesive lectures. Disappointed. Lots of random topics talked about .but nothing in depth.,1
"One would learn a thing or two, but the course is very sparse compared to other machine learning courses, and I didn't feel that it was worth the time and the cost.",1
The course is well organized but I don't think it covered all the basics.,1
Not the quality i expected. The capstone project should have been little more challenging and something new.,1
"I found much of the content to be interesting and timely. However, I thought the quizzes were poorly written. There was no feedback, so as a learner it was hard to grow from errors. Also, there were many that required more than one answer, if you missed one, you missed entire question. Without feedback, it was difficult to know which one you missed. The week 4 lesson content was a bit dense for an introductory course. It was dry and could've been more global. Last, the large lesson assignment was only graded by peers with no feedback from the instructor.",1
"I expected more content. The course description says that there is material for 4-8 hours, however the videos are only one hour long.",1
"This course means well but the lectures in the first half of the course are not good. The instructor seems to take a midway between rigorous mathematics, using terms like robust etc while at the same time also trying to keep it easily accessible. RD Peng's courses take a much better approach in that they keep things at one end of the spectrum (simple language). Having a background in theoretical physics and computer science, this duality in this course is very confusing for me. Also, I do not need to see a tiny, grainy video inset of the instructor during the lecture videos.",1
too many videos and texts.,1
Nice course but the peer assignment is awful.,1
"This course (as the previous one) needs some improvements. First learning only relying on videos is not very effective. There are no lecture slides neither consistent addtional resources to grasp seriously the materials. Also the way quizzes are designed is not - in my opinion, very well planned. The videos alone do not give consistent background to approach seriously the quizzes. Also - again in my opinion, I didn't saw a consistent approach to the materials, neither the examples given made any sense. In the last video, there is a mention to the business world and how to apply this savoir relier approach, but in contrast the videos and examples show as examples a situation extreme with an avalanche, use the HEC MBA program as example. I simply don't see how this can relate with the business world as a consistent comparison. I think you should reflect on this.",1
The course was still useful and with new information but I really found it lacking cohesion with the overall specialization and with its own content.,1
"I am not connecting to the instructor at all. The material is well managed and organized but I am not able to really hear or understand. Further, my connection to the site is disturbing. In this and a couple of other courses, the video lectures jump around and begin in the middle of the lecture. Between these two issues, I am not having a good experience with this course. I live in the US and have graduate degrees in public health .",1
"Personally I don't recommend this course. I really need to learn data warehousing for my job and I have no problem with learning by doing. This course gave me basics, but the learning was very stiff. I think it's just to theoretical here.",1
"Its good for the starters but touches very few and very basic concepts. No offense, but the professor could have made it much more interaction by making the better slights he would just read values without even using markers",1
"Many of the problem sets ask you to apply theorems in ways that have not been demonstrated. If a student makes a mistake, no feedback is given other than, ""That is not the right answer"".",1
"Introduced too many tools in a single course. Javascript, CSS, JQuery is very vast and it is not possible to learn everything in one course. They should have been introduced one by one. It took a lot of time for me to capture what the video taught. I had to do a LOT of self learning",1
It could have been more in depth.,1
Good content,1
"I didn't find this module very helpful and some of the assignments were truly confusing. I wish there was more ""meat"" in the sessions and more availability to access the lecturers more readily when there was confusion. I don't like the fact I pay money for other people to ""assess"" my work when half of them don't even read my submissions properly. Or the question. Or both. So if the lectures don't stretch me, I find my money spent unwisely.",1
"The material is useful, but the execution is poor. There were numerous quiz questions that I think they just had coded wrong on their end. I think they need to carefully look at the questions with the most incorrect answers and ask themselves if they've made a mistake. Also, this might be the first time they've tried making a peer-reviewed project part of the course, but they did a poor job. They made it a homework assignment for week 2, but didn't make it clear that it wasn't due until the end of the course, even though Coursera sends you emails saying it's due soon. This caused a great deal of confusion. Some of the required readings also had broken links. It's odd nobody on their end checked those the week the material was taught. They do provide a lot of useful supplemental material (though often pay-walled).",1
Very easy,1
Short of content and engagement,1
Ill give two stars cause lectures are way to boring to follow.,1
I was expecting the capstone to be different than what it ended being. I didn't find it as practical and beneficial as the other courses.,1
"Much work needs to be done on this course to make it friendly to learners. The quizzes and assignments do not align with what is taught in the lessons. Further, the content in the lessons does not even show or explain what is expected from the learning.I spent the majority of my time exploring the discussions to discover what I was supposed to be doing and the rest of it on Google teaching myself the concepts that were not taught in the course.",1
There are no advanced stuff these what is taught are basics any graduate or undergraduate student can easily pickup on his/ her own interest. What a waste of time .,1
"a let down and not up to par with other courses in the series.Huge amount of time is wasted bsically repeating that the API is close to scala collections'. The huge amout of time is wasted again on very simple dataframe APIs including several slides presenting the show() function. Allow me to repeat : several slides presenting the show() function.Finally the assignments are unimaginative and mechanical. The desciption is really confuse and most of the time is spend trying to chase small differences away to please the grader.The sole part of the course that seemed interesting was the shuffling one, that was unfourtunately ignored on the assignmentsNot related to the course but to spark: What utter mess are dataframes and datasets filled with boilerplate type conversions and runtime erros. I shy away in disgust form this untyped IDE-unfriendly monstruosity.",1
"The lectures are good, but in the assignments he asks for tasks that are not at all explained in the videos. For a beginner's course it is way too difficult and time consuming.",1
A basic course but not for the ones who don't know anything about java or android. Not made for the beginners. Also the submitting projects work is complicated and should be made more easier.Not recommended for the starter.,1
final project almost impossible based on lectures,1
"The assignments were tough and they really tested your knowledge of python. That being said, the lectures were absolutely useless. I spent 90% of my time trying to figure out python through stack overflow. The jupyter platform is also very frustrating. For whatever reason, error messages kept coming up as I was trying to complete the assignments. At one point, I lost all my work because of this error.",1
"The course focused so much in interacting with images instead of the HTML, CSS and JS subjects",1
A submission too complicate to learn chinese-Three submission is too reasonable.,1
"This course is just definitions. I will finish the course, but I do not recommend it for someone who needs a technical approach. I was expecting a few more technical examples or exercises (mixed with their accompanying definitions). This course are pure lectures, no practice beyond open-ended questions. I wish it was a blend of lectures and practice. and not so purely academic.",1
"First part (HTML&CSS) are good, but JS is to fast and hard to follow for the beginners.",1
"Using MOOC 2, I was really hoping we would go more in depth on (free) tools like Google Analytics. I would have liked information on how to better utilize the information I get from Twitter, Pinterest, and Facebook's built in analytics tools as well. I know I'm under-utilizing them at present, and there's good stuff there.In spite of claims to the contrary, the Lexalytics and IBM Bluemix videos did feel like extended infomercials. Moreover, I work for a small non-profit, and we have neither the funds or bandwidth to utilize programs like this. I think the time could have been better used doing a deeper dive with Klout and SocialMention. I'm working on the assignment now and feel like we barely scraped the surface with both of these programs.There are just too many tools being introduced in this MOOC, and not enough practical learning. Tools are fantastic, but it's important to be utilizing them properly, otherwise I end up feeling like I'm wasting time.",1
incomplete and not clear. extremely disappointed.,1
Sound is too quiet,1
Leaves out so much of basic stuff. I think this course is for 4th graders.,1
"This class is far too theoretical and abstract. You only have to get 50% to pass the quizzes, which indicates how difficult it is to understand the material.",1
"Some profs are very good, some are terrible. The terrible ones need to improve their teaching skills and even language skills. As a native Chinese speaker, I find some of the lectures very boring.Good lectures are clear, concise, and right to the point.Good teachers make the learning experience effortless and fun, poor teachers make it like a torture.",1
"Too much math! This course was not at all what I was expecting it to be... which could be both good and bad, depending on your own perspective. It concentrates heavily on the logistical side of negotiations via mathematical analysis to figure out ""what's at stake"" in a negotiation (i.e. ""the pie"") and less so on learning actual negotiation techniques. I got halfway through the first week before deciding to un-enroll. That said, Professor Nalebuff has a very engaging teaching style and presents each lecture in a dynamic fashion via animation. If you are a math whiz who excels in algebra and can do complex mathematical equations quickly on the fly, then this course will definitely benefit you. If you are like me, however, and looking for a course that will focus more on artistry and practical real-world application, then this course is not for you.",1
"- Assumptions about the student are not clear, before starting the course.Instructor examples are not practical in all contexts.Jump to dijkstra in very second week, without clarity on major C++ concepts and examples, is too much an expectation from the student switching from C to C++ for the first time.Confusion with deadline for assignments.too many lectures during later week courses, as if the effort is to crunch everything in that week and complete the course.If its spaced properly with examples and problems over few more weeks, it would help.",1
"this is heavy material, and I suggest it be broken down to two separate courses, and the author take his time in explaining the various concepts in much more detail vs. trying to cram them within 5 or 10 minute sessions. I know I wasn't the only one struggling to keep up with the teacher after week 2.",1
The capstone project had nothing to do with the previous three courses.,1
Too little information.,1
"Good course, but NO Statement of Accomplishment certificate",1
"I hate to write a negative review when the designers of the course have clearly put a lot of love and attention to detail into making it. But...The quality of the code is bad. The quality of the testing code is even worse. This endeavours to teach some horrible practices. That's a shame, because the editing quality of the videos is excellent, the use of git and rspec is likewise commendable.Even worse, it's not entirely clear who the target audience is. A lot of the topics introduced are aimed at complete novices, yet not explained in a way novices might understand. The course needs some serious rethinking and refactoring.",1
Definitely a very light course designed for beginners and to promote the Leiden's 3 Years International Studies Program in Safety and Security! Somewhat very disappointing to me! Useful to note the not so realistic 3 peer-reviews awaited in that course... Two of 1000 words and one of 350-550 words! Totally unbalanced!,1
"The course provides fundamentals as advertised, but the delivery was not impressive. For example the lecturer's speech interrupts, changing words and thought-flow. Examples given were not well thought-out, for example HR was said to be hard-set because it was ""outsourced"" which doesn't make sense. Another example would be where the lecturer said that ""stand-up meetings"" mean no body is allowed to sit down?! Generally, seems to me the course was filmed in a hurry and wasn't delivered good enough for a rating above the basic fundamental two stars.",1
Too much theoretical.This course should not be a separate course.It can be a part of other course.,1
"personally speaking, the contents are not helpful. and the multiple-choice quizzes stuck me a lot.",1
Help on topics is very limited. Nothing more than instruction videos. Discussion forums are helpful only to solve assignments. There is hardly any input from instructor about genuine theoretical questions.,1
Very interesting but not practical,2
Would have loved a little more theory.,2
Decent course to get an introduction to portfolio theory. Some work needs to be done to update the pdf slides with what the professor adds in handwriting during the course.,2
Unbelievably difficult for understanding!,2
"This course could have been better in my opinion, if we could have exercise that would deal with the concepts in more detail. I felt myself involved deeply in understanding the problem statement, rather than practicing the concepts explained in the course.",2
"This module took me on an interesting journey with lots of twists and turns. While I love challenges and learning otherwise I wouldn't have taken this course. I'd like to suggest the following: mentor to assist students, review of codes I found lots of glitches, one quiz rather than two, cut back on timeframe. I'd like to give more stars but am being generous with 3 stars.",2
Please show the quiz answers for verification purpose since we have to buy the course to submit answers,2
"I'm not going to recommend this course strongly. I learned from it, not denying that. The reading materials were great. There are critical organization issues to learn. But there are two things I don't like. First, the assignment is not well designed. Article reflection is a convenient way to give an assignment but sometimes off the topics in the course notes. Other courses have along assignments but they are much better designed. Second, the instructor threw a lot of terminologies with much explanations. I don't think people would ever remember or use them correctly. Why bother using them?",2
"Interesting case studies, but very uninteresting professor.",2
A good introduction to data science.,2
Too much stuff is taught without teachings the basics of the language,2
"The course content was slightly repetitive and the information on the Myers-Briggs personality types can be found online. It is such a pity that payment must be made to access the graded coursework, preventing one from completing the course if one chooses not to pay.",2
"I was somewhat disappointed in this course as I expected much more ""practice"". The assignments did not have you actually perform any analytics activities. The course materials seem very out of date considering how much things change in the digital age. Reading Blogger posts from 2006 on a Blogger blog that hasn't been updated since 2012 is not forward thinking in my view. Yes, things don't always change, but the face of analytics changes daily.",2
Good course,2
"I like the sense of Humor of Dr. Charles. His teaches like someone of our age, like a friend, I appreciate that. The course will not be a burden on anyone. It's easy to follow along.The concepts taught are not taught in a structured way (although the way they are taught is good). My advice to the staff is that Structure all the similar things and explain them at one place. Some important and helpful things are left out.Overall, it's a good course for beginners.",2
good course,2
Interesting course! But the lecture videos are too long.,2
"A bit of a deep plunge if you've never coded before, yet too shallow to satisfactorily introduce someone skilled in other languages to the many peculiarities of R. I don't envy instructors trying to balance these two needs in such a short time.",2
Prefer more references/examples shown in lectures.,2
"Concise but too concise I feel. Maybe it's meant for more foundation/beginner level ? Else, need more details. Not just overview.And, need more involvement/engagement from students, need multiple (randomized per attempt) questions in quizzes, need participation from course producers/TAs for questions and clarifications needed by students (in discussion forums).",2
"The beginning sections of the course were interesting as they were descriptive of some pragmatic approaches towards thinking and learning like the POMODORO technique (excuse me if spelling is wrong). The later portions could have been better although they weren't that bad either. Overall, I learned how to learn!",2
"Nice structure although needed more assignments outside just the quizzes, to get you to use the skills",2
Just a basic introduction to computer science.,2
"Extremely useful info, but the material is too shallow to be satisfying.",2
Videos and quizes are too long and too large,2
well organized but need more assignments and practical assignments,2
It should show more how to implement the skills learned in real life.,2
"The course is interesting, but the grading system needs to improve substantially. The grader bugs considerably, and the questions are often not well defined, which requires a lot of unnecessary trial and error to understand what exactly the question was about. Finally, complete the assignments took way long that what it is suggested.",2
This course mainly focus on statistics and statistical parameters and almost nothing about about Understanding Clinical Research - as title anotate,2
"The content was interesting, but it was too much theory, sometimes a bit borring",2
"The interviews were great, and useful to see a real experienced designer, however the contents in the course were almost nonexistent. The homework was well planed but it depends much more in the student to learn something that the contents exposed in the videos. Tips aren't the same as methodologies and content in character design.",2
Took this as part of a Java specialization but would not have taken it otherwise.,2
The first three weeks are really interesting. The 4th and 5th are boring: it explains too many arguments in givin just hint to many of them. Many videos are too long and there are too many.In my opinion they should focus on fewer things and explain them in ore details. Many times the lecture becomes just a list.,2
Course contents are not very well organized.,2
nice but doesnt give you much knowledge,2
"There exist some sort of help for solving programming.However, those bad quiz as well as not so comprehensive courses design totally ruin it.",2
"The content is good, but the way the lectures are given not so much.",2
"descriptions was not enough for me, the BMC concepts could be more elaborated by giving examples and explaining different types of businesses.",2
"The course is very well structured, but the teacher is boring",2
The explaining part could have been better.,2
"knowledge-based, no skill-based work at all which is weird since the capstone is skills-based",2
It is a good course for beginners in Python language.,2
The course is good for getting an overall idea of the main topics of finance but not on getting a deep understanding on them,2
"The course material could have been better....Instructor was just reading out content, more practical example and case studies could be a part of content.",2
"I may have gotten more out of this course if I hadn't already read ""The Genius of Dogs"".I would like to suggest that the slides be subjected to more rigorous proofreading, as I came across several typographical errors. It doesn't look professional.On quizzes, when a student is asked to select the one FALSE answer, please remove any ""all of the above are TRUE"" statements. A mentor replied to another student who pointed out this conumdrum on the Week 7 Forum with: ""I understand where you are coming from Phil, but only one of the answers as an individual answer is incorrect. The answer ""all of the above are correct"" is neither true nor false, as only one of the answers in the 'all' is the exception."" And I say that if I have a bouquet of roses, 11 red ones and 1 yellow and I were to say that ""all of the roses in my bouquet are red"" you would correct me, as one is not, and ""all"" demands 12 out of 12, otherwise, it is not all. Should you still feel a quibble, let me suggest that you contact the Department of Philosophy, ask for someone expert in symbolic logic and run it by him/her.",2
"Standart indutrie DAW, but not my favorite. Good performance from the teach! I had many issue with pro Tools first, be sure to get a full vertion and an iLok key from avid before enrolling, will save much stress and trouble.",2
Not enough students to give review grading and earn a grade.,2
Some parts of the material were very academic and lack enough explanations and examples.,2
Basic stuff.Good choice of subjects.A little too short.,2
"I couldn't finish it without purchasing it, in spite of active participation and high scores on all the assignments I had access to.",2
"Interessante, porÃ©m poderia ser melhor elaborado.This course is interesting, but could be better elaborated.",2
I do not think some quiz questions are covered in the lectures.,2
lectures should be more detailed!,2
"It was quite confusing with unlocking next weeks work, and the filming of the videos were poor. Eventhough everything was understandable",2
"The Teacher was great, but I was behind a month just because nobody will grade assigment on week2.",2
"needed more depth, which still could have been achieved in a 1-week format",2
I knew nothing about Jefferson before this course and nothing about his 'age' - not sure I am much the wiser about the latter after it! I enjoyed the tours round the historic sites and I thought the lecturer came over as warm and enthusiastic but it seemed he was preaching about a saint rather than giving a detached academic assessment of a historical figure and I found that it was hard to see the wood for the trees at times. Hagiographic might be an unkind description but it was certainly very respectful to the great man. I also liked the use of a student in cooperation with the lecturer.- he set the scene well and was a good interviewer.,2
it's hard to understand,2
"While this topic is interesting, and course goes over some examples. I feel course lacked depth, and didn't really answers main question: how to find business model, or gave case studies of business model. Just reiterated obvious examples, which is common knowledge.Topic : 10/10Quality: 4/10Presentation: 5/10",2
"Not much of a course, I understand why it exists, but it's basically just getting setup with the environment. Almost not worthy of course status.",2
please improve hand-out for self study.,2
Too little course material; video's too flashy (noisy) and do not discuss enough information,2
"The lectures weren't always easy to follow but the quizzes were really useful as they meant it was necessary to understand the material. Definitely a useful course, I will be interested to see how it relates to the real world of derivatives pricing.",2
Very basic Course. It involves a lot of GUI Concepts which may not be useful for general programmers.,2
"Great learning overall. The down side I've found is that Peer review assignment, some of the peers don't review my assignments nicely, I tried to make interaction but seems not working.",2
I understood the point that in script writing matters more than theory but I don't think that it's right that all marks I got I received from other with me with zero feedback from lectors and teachers.Definitely I wouldn't pay for sertificate but as first step and making some ready draft for further polishing the script this course was enough. So from one side it helped me to move forward with my idea but on other hand I didn't get any professional feedback and advices from teacher. There were some very useful comments from other students but I also need some help from people who are real professionals in it.,2
"Very useful course for newcomers to Machine Learning.The basic ideas are plain and clear and its cover major aspects.However, the value of the course would be much higher if the real practical examples are used in roll forward manner. For instance, throughout the course we are considering housing pricing from the plain gradient descent algorithm to much more complicated issues.So far, topics are too theoretical. An sometimes it is hard to apply to the practice.Moreover, it is nice to add the course with notes in pdf format because to listen or watch video lectures is not convenient. At least, it would be nice to have the set of outer links to read each topic in details.",2
Is very basic and don't send assignments becose I don't pay the course.,2
"Given the importance of this subject, this course should have been split in two or more or have a longer duration to properly address subjects as GLM or model selection techniques.",2
"Im glad I god new knowledge. My view of the course is that Its very theoretical, but not necessary needs to be be. It could benefit with som illustrations for the achy types, since its already around. With some use of either tv-shows or cartoons it can be clear what it means for the types. However this is only my view and to make it even better. Thanks",2
Good basic course for money management,2
"More visual explanations would help with concept. It is good where there are them, but not so good where there isn't.",2
"Very simple, complete and usefulthanks",2
"Good course, but could be more challenging. For people growing up with the space race it has a lot of interesting video and written material.But there are a lot of simple errors in the material and the assignments. Hopefully that will be addressed. I'd give it 4/5 once it's all sorted.Recommended if you can cope with the odd frustration.",2
"A good course, but not up to par with the first two. The content was far more theoretical and left me looking for applicable information. That said it was still a good course.",2
Not a very good course. The assignments are not very clear. Could have done much more like integrating front-end etc in place of that loopback module. Was really disappointed with this one. Should have given 0 stars but gave 3 stars for Jogesh Muppala as he is my favourite teacher when it comes to MOOC,2
Need to show more stuff on Java instead of focusing on using BlueJ and stuff.,2
"Course is very basic , although contents are compact and informative.",2
Course material reference readings were good but videos were pathetic. It was more like a high school kid reading the slides.,2
Interesting tha,2
"I learned quite a lot that I can use for research, personal projects, and general understanding of neural networks, but unfortunately this course is getting quite out of date at this point. I would recommend to others looking for a first course in neural networks (for machine learning applications) look for a newer course.",2
"Interesting material, but wasn't necessarily of the same depth of knowledge like previous courses in the series",2
"This could probably be better broken into two one week courses ""History of Phone Technology"" and ""Intro to IoT"". Many reviewers say they bail out in first few lectures because content seems too far removed from IoT. I enjoyed the last few lectures with examples of IoT, but could have skipped the rest.",2
"Probably, I wouldn't have a course just about how to hire/build a data team.",2
"brought up some good concept inside, like ""tidy data"", but not in detail, how to grab data from different source shouldn't be difficult. should have more focus on talking about data.table, ""tidy data"" principles etc.",2
"It is a good introductory course, but it could be optional for people with some experience in the field, as it is very basic.",2
"Decent course, except in the last week it felt a bit stitched together from parts of a previous course and a new one. The jump in flow seemed abrupt and the relevance of some of the contents (regarding Future's) was not clear.",2
no one is here for review my work,2
"Pretty simple, the Univ of Michigan Data Science with Python set the bar pretty high.",2
nice to learn:)),2
"For me this kind of teaching is not very useful. I will want to learn more abou grammar so I can make sentences with sense alone. And of course more of phonetics. The teacher was great, she speaks very clear and explain well",2
"It good for beginners who have no idea where to start in creating sites .But, can improve some of the audios are not complete yet the audio has finished and in some of video are not completely organized",2
It's a good class and I learned a lot. The learning curve shoots up exponentially around the fourth week. I could see this course being perfect if broken down into two classes.,2
"There is a lot of self-teaching with these courses because there are no professors present to reach out to with questions. In addition, the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coding. At times the code that were provided in the lecture videos were out of date and a lot of time was spent on googling to find the updated code. This is definitely not a beginner coder course and I do not recommend it to anyone who has not coded before.",2
"The subject is really interesting, and some of the shown approaches really ""close to the edge"".However, there is too much ""cut and paste"" from other courses. this makes this one difficult to follow. It has lost ""coherence"". The cross-references don't make any sense, and the assignments fall too short with regard to the content. I think the remake from the original ""Functional Programming ___ in Scala"" + ""Reactive Programming"" has not been as successful as it should. This new format within Coursera (everything shorter, more expensive and with less people involved) is not as good as the original one. Maybe this is the only way they can make enough money to sustain the whole... but the ""more idealistic"" start was far more pleasant.",2
"Needs way bigger scope and a bit more going into details. The Full Stack Web Development course is somewhat like that. Lectures are good and easy to understand, both visuals and speak are nice and clear. Hopefully next one remains great quality but with more content :)",2
nice course but i did not recieved my certificate yet,2
Its good but found it a little theoretical.,2
Very helpful tips for preparing a professional business document. Hoping the course could have more focused exercises to make sure learners actually master the skills.,2
"I want to give 3.5 stars but there is only option for 3 or 4.Given that it's geared more towards wanna be managers in this field. I would have expected lot of case studies, and links to additional material for individual reading plus a mini write up or a project at the end.For MOOCs to compete with a degree program or an onsite instruction few of the things I think that are needed areInterviews with industry practitioners which is a big plus.interviews/postings from people with similar background as the 90% of the MOOC students of this program who made it... this motivates the students from dropping from the middle of the course/specilization programslinks to additional articles that the students can read at leisurewriteup/project as assignments that the students can pursue and publish (not necessarily for grade but as a mind jogger)One more thing that I think should help (not specific to this course) is that the student with the best grade should be offered one free course and think this will motivate the students to complete the courses.",2
It is a great educational experience that opened the door to the ancient Greek history.,3
"really enjoying the course, good information presented well and access to excellent reading materials",3
A good & fun idea to implement. Would have prefered implementing my own idea though.,3
"I believe the course could go a bit more in detail on the algorithms and the mathematics behind it, but overall it was a great course.",3
Good course,3
"enjoyed this, as well as finding out I dont know as much as what I thought i did",3
There was not as much coding as prior courses but students can learn the knowledge of database.,3
Very basic introduction to Python.,3
A really interesting and relevant course. Replayable and pause-able video lectures are obviously the way to go. The software-driven transcription of the lectures is useful but needs a lot of reformatting and some error correction (this process is not a bad learning tool in its own right!),3
I have learnt so much for doing this course. I have recommended the course to friends and families.,3
Great initial course.,3
"The course material is great, but the assignment is too simple, especially the last(You don't need to write any codes). I think the assignments can be more challenging.",3
"Great course for data preparation for ML which is sometimes neglected in other courses. Great instructor. Useful assignments. Assignments require research on your own which is good. I would recommend to maybe make the course longer and cover more topics (in-depth string processing etc.), because it felt a bit short. Thanks Dr. Brooks for putting this together.",3
Very good introduction! I only miss more examples of urban/regional planning or transportation networks.,3
nice approach...,3
"It is not perfect, but as an open course it is impressive.",3
Great course. Could do with going over things a bit more deeply at times. There is a lot to take in for one course but still very good. I enjoyed it immensely.,3
"The course focused too much on careers in SEO, and the required personality traits. SEO is part of many other career streams, so spending 1/2 of the course on SEO as a career was a complete waste of time for me. Did enjoy the historical walk-through of the GA algorithm, and the point to refocus on. Thanks",3
Really good course but it should be a little more interactive.,3
Very interesting curse. It would be nice if yu can add sme examples from outside the US.,3
Don't be deterred by the use of octave. It's turned out to be a very quick way to get into the algebra of the models. A good course to point you towards the mathematical foundations: if you want more depth the detail is provided.,3
It was good. I give four stars because it was easier than I expected.,3
The course was excellent! The only thing that I would change is to have more instruction in writing for social media.,3
it helped me to be more productive and to stay organised !,3
Contents were short and great but some tools and practicle s/w should be introduced in it.,3
"Interesting course! Gives a good initial notion of how the EU works.Two written peer-graded assignments are cool: it's very interesting to read peers' submissions from all over the world (I got ones from Spain, China and US).A major drawback: the slides are mostly bright pictures. It would be nice to make the slides more informative and available for download.",3
"I thoroughly enjoyed this course. I would highly recommend it to new writers, old authors, editors, and anyone interested in stories. It was a great recap and refreshed the basics.",3
The course is good but the end of unit quiz are not accessible unless you pay.,3
a good class and would love to recommend to my friends.,3
It is simply superb,3
"This was another strong course from Wesleyan, and well produced. However some of the weekly problems were vague and it was not clear exactly what was being sought or how they would be evaluated, as they have been very clear in the previous mini courses in this specialization.",3
"Topics covered are great, but there is a lack of assignments to be done by students completely on themselves.",3
The instructor was hard to understand at times.,3
Very detailed and structured content. Is it possible to get printable content as well along with videos?,3
Good Course material and Assignment.,3
"Great introductory course for the subject. There were some parts, especially at the start of this course, in which the subject matters were being explained too simplistically and very quickly - not a good combination to maximize ones efforts.",3
Good basic knowledge on PM,3
It was a very great experience to have this course. this has given me a lots of things to gain. I thanks to courser and group for p,3
It's everything I needed to keep running with Data Scientist Specialization preparing.Thank you so much for your support!,3
"This course helps in understanding the basic and overall concepts in HTML, CSS and JavaScripts",3
Interesting,3
"Lots of value in the course. If the tutors didn't read from their notes, but instead would speak freely into the camera, it would be even more engaging and personal.",3
"Very good content, very well explained... great course. Classification its a very broad topic but i think this is great introduction.The hands on where kinda on the easy side... but very interesting.",3
Interesting and Interactive,3
had fun with ur studies thank youfor helping,3
Enjoyed Prof. Ayres' lectures and the readings. Definite,3
"The course was great. The videos and assignments were clear, well paced, and the forums were useful in getting questions answered. The lecturer made the material easy to understand. I've taken down one star just because I think potentially more ground could have been covered in the course, and the quiz and assignments were quite easy (in other words, could have been more challenging). Great experience overall though!",3
This is a great course for the beginners of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The contents are quite comprehensive and inspiring. The most important is that all the assignments are delicate and well-designed. Highly recommend!!!,3
"Very interesting crash course in business development, coupled with energy issues and technologies. Suitable for beginners in business development strategies and concepts.",3
Too short,3
I learnt a lot...Kudos to NW University and Randy Helvec,3
"Very interesting course and very well structured. The subjects are handled with the correct depth corresponding to its importance. The indicated time spent by week corresponds accurately to the time needed, if you have some previous experience in web development.The exercises are focused in the important details and very well organized.If you have interest in client side web development and particularly in Angular, this is a very good opportunity to learn.Probably in a near future this course must be updated to cover Angular 2.0.It really worth the time spent!",3
Not so good! There is much water,3
Course was good but I thought more could of been added to the content to make more understandable. For ex. videos,3
Great,3
"Very well designed. Estimated time required to complete the assignments were inappropriate, it took me longer.",3
VERY THEORETHICAL. NEED TO HAVE MORE IMAGES OR MAPS OTHERWISE CAN GET BORED WITH THE GUY SPEAKING.GOOD LENGTH OF VIDEOSGOOD REAL LIFE EXAMPLES,3
Challenging and great!,3
"Pretty solid course for an online format. Solid grader and I enjoy how you can input derived equations in the homeworks that makes it feel more brick and mortar class. This beats other class approaches I have used in other platforms that use peer grading. Very comprehensible introduction and a satisfying course. I wish the course work was a bit more challenging. I know this is difficult in an online format (1st offering?) but when I compare this homework to their actual class websites (for on-campus students), it is obvious this online format was given the ""easier"" problems to solve.",3
Very good course and very pleasant Professor !,3
Good beginner course providing solid basics . Instructor is excellent,3
"Great course. Spectacular support material mainly the YouTube videos ""Multitasking""",3
Exceptional. Recommend it to any business profe,3
"A strong overview of the crisis that balances the depth and breadth of the material well.Strengths:Balance of narrative and data.Logical sequencing gives a nice structure and a more digestible package.Excellent level of detail, neither missing the forest for the trees nor ignoring the trees altogether.Weaknesses:Does not address alternative theories or interpretations of the crisis, even to shoot them down.Several quizzes were poorly-constructed, featuring obvious typos or nonsensical statements.Additional module to update the material (stale since mid-2015) was promised, but not delivered.",3
"I enjoy the humor of the instructor and the ease of his presentation. Now, I just need to become familiar with the vocabulary of this industry. Nice job!",3
The teaching is very clear. It will be better if there are more tests. Exercises are important in coding.,3
A very good course. The good thing about it is the way it is organized.,3
Good introductory course covering a wide range of concepts. I particularly liked the lecturer - good tone and pace.,3
"Straight-forward, basic",3
Some very interesting insights and good analogies,3
"Interesting course but:1) The transcripts for each week are appalling. Here is a copied and pasted example: ""Separatist groups remained active in almost 90% of decapitation cases where only a third of ideologically ideological organizations such as left wing and right wing organizations. Are damaged by it. And then, in general, in 17% of the cases. So 7% of the cases, decapitation led to the collapse of an organization."" How are those that are hearing impaired meant to understand what the course leader is communicating? It took me so long to understand the transcript that I may as well have listened instead. The subtitles option reads the same as the transcript - not much good for anyone with anything but perfect hearing.2) The estimated timings for each activity are somewhat optimistic. '10 minutes' is the recommended reading time for each week's reading content. Within this reading list are, on average, 8 articles, some of which amount to over 70 pages - if each article is roughly 25-40 pages on average, and there are around 8 articles, how will this reading activity take the student only '10 minutes' to complete?Apart from that, I did really enjoy the course!!",3
"way to beginner, felt it could've gone a bit more in depth coming from a known university such as Duke.",3
Very interesting and explained common language. Looking forward for the next modules.,3
I didn't come away with much understanding of how dogs think - I don't have much experience with dogs and I was hoping to learn about how to have a good relationship with a dog before I decide whether to get one - but the science is fascinating and I am glad I took the class anyway.,3
simple and useful,3
Background details missing but overall fantastic experience.... :),3
Useful for business risk analysis and modeling complex problem.,3
Interesting,3
"A good course, please provide more practice quiz in depth.",3
This would be very effective for my personal skill enhancement.,3
"I like the balance between learning the principles involved in creating effective visualizations and practicing them while learning to use Tableau. I was happy with the visualization I created for my final assignment. It would NOT have been as good had I not taken this course and learned to make use of pre Gestalt principles, attentive attributes and decluttering techniques to reduce the cognitive load involved in viewing my visualization.",3
Well presented content.It was a little bit weird for me to jump straight to jQuery and spending so little time on Javascript but it works out for the course. I would suggest a couple of more examples and explanation of general programming concepts with providing relevant pdf.Generally a very good and content-rich course.,3
Great and effective,3
Course only gives an overview.,3
"The best thing about the course was the acknowledgment that this is a highly interdisciplinary area and the emphasis on future research directions. The topics are covered by providing plenty of background explanation, though I found the repetition way too much at times. I would have liked to see the English in the slides, transcription of the videos, and most importantly, in the quizzes, proofread - at times, the seemingly small errors made it hard to understand what the quiz questions were about. A good introductory course all around. Thanks for your efforts!",3
"The assignments are extremely challenging and enjoyable. The videos can get a bit confusing, but overall a great course.",3
A decent overview of regression,3
"This is an excellent course about beginning of python programming, I recommend to take it, the material is clear and you can repeat the videos every time that you need.",3
"I enjoyed taking this course very much. The classes were well thought-out and laid a good foundation for understanding Python Data structures. While prior experience is helpful, I think the lectures were clear enough for even someone new to Python to grasp. I would recommend this course to anyone looking to build on the basic knowledge of Python.",3
A great introductory course to Swift!,3
a clear intro to some basic-moderate user level functions in Excel. Good for those who have yet to use functions and graphing capabilities of the software.,3
"I have one issue about week 4 ""Append"" tree. I did not get how Append correlates with binary digits. I would like to have some step by step example how will we create a tree like s1 = Single(1) appendLeaf Single(2), s2 = s1 appendLeaf Single(3), s3 = s2 appendLeaf Single(4), s4 = s4 appendLeaf Single(5) using binary digits?",3
"A good course! The assignments were fun to write. Some videos were redundant, but overall I enjoyed it greatly.",3
"Great Course, explores the war in its different facets.",3
Very good course. Entertaining videos that keep your attention throughout and clearly outline and explain good practices for mentoring teachers. Highly recommended.,3

Good course.,4
"As an experienced vocational education teacher, this course has highlighted many concepts and ideas that I can pass on to my students to help them pass the course I am teaching. It has also opened my eyes to misconceptions and mistakes I am making in my own studies towards a Master of Education.",4
"This is something really great and I appreciate all the efforts of the creators of that course, especially Dr. Charles Severance, who has an amazing ability of imparting his knowledge in a very colourful and enjoyable way, while fully substantively and clearly.This is my first ever on-line course, and if the remaining parts are conducted in similar way, I am more than impatient to start it immediately. It is a pity, it is 3:54 AM... :)And one more thing - this course as well as the book is indeed for the very beginners however with some ability of logical thinking (if you are not such a very beginner it will take just couple of days to finish it, as it was in my case).So listen carefully what Dr. Chuck is saying, read the book, take look at the slides, and other available stuff and don't hesitate to start and don't give up if something goes wrong.",4
"A good pace for someone like myself who had not ""programmed"" since learning PASCAL back in 1983. I look forward to taking the entire series of Python classes.",4

I am from biology background and used to have least interest in programming. But the Course is very good. The best instructors ever I can have. They started from scratch so that even a new one can understand. Gradually I got good hands in programming at least in MATLAB.The best part is the assignment. Brain storming assignments which were very helpful to learn the language. Also the mentors and instructors were great who were quick in responses to our queries. All that was very helpful. Thank you so much. I would appreciate if you can make such a great course with python also.Thank you.RegardsMegha Malhotra,4
