teacher:I am going to ask Kayla to share her reasoning;student:No,0
teacher:Why can we not use twofourths based on what their directions say,0
teacher:Why cant I just add oneninth plus oneninth plus oneninth plus oneninth,0
teacher:why is that problem,0
teacher:Why cant I do that,0
teacher:So why cant I do it,0
teacher:So why is that wrong based on what the directions tell us to do Grace,0
teacher:Why is that wrong,0
teacher:Why can we not use this,0
teacher:Why cant we use it,0
teacher:So why cant we use it,0
teacher:So why cant I use it,0
teacher:Kye why cant we do it,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why didnt you just leave it this way,0
teacher:Why didnt you leave it this way,0
teacher:Why did you change it,0
teacher:Why do I say this ones a little easier,0
teacher:Because;student:Um you divide five by five,0
teacher:Why;student:Its half,0
teacher:So when you had your sample size how did you come up with your final number based on your sample size,0
teacher:What was the pattern;student:Well I used a pattern,0
teacher:Alright Aria coming up let us know what your thinking is,0
teacher:Why not;student:No,0
teacher:Why can we not twofourths based on their directions,0
teacher:So why isnt it twofourths,0
teacher:And why would we have missed the problem,0
teacher:Why are you going to do 60 time five;student:Im going to do 60 times five,0
teacher:Why did you choose addition Ember,0
teacher:I think addition is a great place to start but why did you choose it,0
teacher:Why did there have to be at least two clues,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:So why do we need at least two clues,0
teacher:Aliza what do you think,0
teacher:Alani what do you think,0
teacher:Why do you think we have to have two clues,0
teacher:Why;student:I think we have to have two clues because  you will have to go to the second clue,0
teacher:Youre absolutely right but why,0
teacher:Can you try to explain it,0
teacher:Why will I never need to show more than 20 people for this,0
teacher:Why cant we have two options;student:Yeah,0
teacher:Why do you think Im picking zeros,0
teacher:Why would we talk about multiplying by zeros,0
teacher:Well why not;student:No,0
teacher:Ezra why do you think Im not right,0
teacher:Why not;student:No,0
teacher:How come;student:80 times five,0
teacher:Why not,0
teacher:Why are you raising your hands he just proved Im right,0
teacher:Jamie can you explain to us why that doesnt work,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Youre absolutely right but why,0
teacher:Why do you think Im going to teach you today how to multiply numbers with zeros,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Anybody figure out why,0
teacher:Why will I never need to show more than 20 people in my sample of 20 lockers,0
teacher:And why did you to two times two;student:So I did two times two,0
teacher:Why is the multiplication hard;student:Yeah,0
teacher:Okay why do you think that;student:What I think is I think that were going to do five times six or 10 times six,0
teacher:Why four times seven,0
teacher:Why 12 times four Lucy;student:What I did first is 12 times four,0
teacher:Why 48 times 12;student:You can do 48 times 12,0
teacher:Why do you say that,0
teacher:Why;student:I think its,0
teacher:Nine10ths because,0
teacher:Why;student:Nine10ths,0
teacher:One10th why is that my smallest fraction;student:One10th,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Six13ths because my bigger denominator means;student:Six13,0
teacher:Why are you doing what times 50 equals 350;student:figure out how to  equals 350,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why do you think that this is our starting point,0
teacher:Why;student:I subtracted 16000 with 11716,0
teacher:Why are you doing that,0
teacher:Why 16000 by 13;student:Division Im trying to divide 16000 by 13,0
teacher:Why;student:But Im starting to regret that,0
teacher:Why;student:I have to subtract 11716 from 16000,0
teacher:Okay why;student:First I subtracted the thing but then I divided the number I got so its 13,0
teacher:Why would you divide;student:Im pretty sure you divide 4000 by 13,0
teacher:Okay why do you say 91 and 53;student:91 and 53,0
teacher:Why did you add nine plus eight,0
teacher:Why did you choose to count by 10,0
teacher:Why did you count by twos,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why has 12 been touched,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why is 12 the only locker so far that has been touched by every single person,0
teacher:Jordan what do you think,0
teacher:Why is 12 touched by every single person so far,0
teacher:Why do you think,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Riley what do you think,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Do you know why Emerson,0
teacher:Mia what do you think,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why do you think its called a pass through point,0
teacher:Why do you think its called a pass through point,0
teacher:Why do we care about these,0
teacher:Why would I ever need to know,0
teacher:So heres my question why did I put small on the top and large on the bottom,0
teacher:Why didnt I put small on the bottom large on the top,0
teacher:Carrington why,0
teacher:How do you know,0
teacher:Why would we add those,0
teacher:Why do you say that,0
teacher:Why James;student:And then that would be,0
teacher:You know why Lucy,0
teacher:Why Julia;student:Divide it by five,0
teacher:Why;student:Thatd be easier to divide,0
teacher:Why would I want to use clue number two first,0
teacher:Okay so actually tell me why,0
teacher:Why do you think Ella ate more,0
teacher:How do you know;student:1000000,0
teacher:How do you know,0
teacher:How do you know,0
teacher:How do you know the tenths place Natalie,0
teacher:Why;student:You round up,0
teacher:Why else do think we would round up at five,0
teacher:Why else,0
teacher:Why else do you think you would round up if its at five,0
teacher:How do you know;student:Three tenths,0
teacher:And how do you know,0
teacher:So who thinks they can explain their thinking well for which benchmark franction it is,0
teacher:Why do you think its two,0
teacher:Okay why,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why do you think they take videos of you;student:If you were at cheer they take videos of us so we can take a look at it and fix our work,0
teacher:Why do you think theyre taking videos,0
teacher:Why is it quick to do a unit fraction for a rule;student:Thats good T,0
teacher:Why was this quick,0
teacher:Why Brendan,0
teacher:Okay but the problem is do you understand why your answer is three eighths;student:Three eighths,0
teacher:How do you know it has two zeros;student:Because it has two zeros,0
teacher:How do you know;student:A hundred,0
teacher:And we know that group B ate threefourths of that so why is the answer threetwelfths,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why is that true,0
teacher:Anybody having an idea of why that might be true,0
teacher:And why does that work,0
teacher:Why does that work,0
teacher:Why does that give you three fifths of of the number,0
teacher:Why does it makes sense that two thirds of two thirds would be less than two thirds,0
teacher:Why does it make sense that the product of two thirds of two thirds would be less than the factor of two thirds;student:Yeah,0
teacher:Why does it make sense,0
teacher:Why the product is smaller;student:I agree with Caleb because one third and now also youre doubling a numerator so that is four thirds then also you have triple the denominator so that might be why you are,0
teacher:So why would the product of two thirds of two thirds be less than two thirds,0
teacher:And how do you know,0
teacher:Why were we trying to find half of the fruit bar at the beginning;student:We were trying to find the half of the half,0
teacher:And how do you know,0
teacher:How do you know,0
teacher:How do we know that there are going to be 30 squares,0
teacher:Why 10 would be the numerator;student:Kind of explain what the answer of the five sixths,0
teacher:Tell your partner what you think the answer would be and how you know,0
teacher:And how do you know,0
teacher:Why would they just focus on that group,0
teacher:Why would they just focus on this row,0
teacher:Why would they just be focused on the first row Logan,0
teacher:Why;student:You just need to worry about group B because its easier,0
teacher:Were just making sense of this picture and why would they use  Why would they have this threefourths here for,0
teacher:So why onefourth twofourths threefourths,0
teacher:Why is it 12,0
teacher:Elliot what do you think that reason might be,0
teacher:Why were we trying to find half of the fruit bar at the beginning,0
teacher:And then why did we have to fold it in half again,0
teacher:Whats your reasoning,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why Jamie,0
teacher:What operation could we use to solve this number story and how do you know,0
teacher:How do you know,0
teacher:How do you know,0
teacher:How do you know;student:No,0
teacher:How do you know,0
teacher:So really are we going to have something greater than twothirds and how do you know,0
teacher:Why;student:No,0
teacher:Why three divided by 13,0
teacher:Why not 12 divided by three,0
teacher:Why does the Lillians picture work,0
teacher:Why is it wrong;student:No wrong,0
teacher:Why do we use benchmark fractions,0
teacher:Why do we use benchmark fractions,0
teacher:Kingsley why do we use benchmark fractions,0
teacher:Why did you do that,0
teacher:Because;student:Yeah,0
teacher:more complete sentence I agree with him because;student:I agree inauidble,0
teacher:Because;student:I agree with your answer very much,0
teacher:Can someone else explain for lane why the answer is Argo,0
teacher:Does anybody know why Im picking clue number two first,0
teacher:Okay but why;student:Because if you have,0
teacher:Why;student:Mmhmm,0
teacher:If this one is because its less than one why would this one be greater,0
teacher:Why do you think,0
teacher:Why did our answer end up being one fourth,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why isnt this going to work,0
teacher:Why is this not going to work for fourths,0
teacher:Why is this not going to work for one fourth,0
teacher:So why is this not going to work,0
teacher:Who can explain why this is true,0
teacher:Who can explain why this is true,0
teacher:Turn and talk to your partner explaining why this is true,0
teacher:That one why,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why did we start by folding our paper in half at the beginning;student:So we could split it in two,0
teacher:How do we know,0
teacher:How do I know this is going vertically,0
teacher:And how do you know,0
teacher:Why by fourths,0
teacher:And over and over and over and over okay why,0
teacher:Why can I can keep going 22 3  3 44,0
teacher:So why does this rule work,0
teacher:Why does when I multiply 25 times 33 make an equivalent fraction,0
teacher:Why does that work,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:How do I know this is vertical,0
teacher:Why did you do that,0
teacher:Why wont this work,0
teacher:Why would we divide;student:I think we should divide,0
teacher:Blake tell me why it is not;student:No,0
teacher:John why are you saying no;student:No,0
teacher:Why not Austin;student:No,0
teacher:How would you know;student:Oh,0
teacher:Why did you take six ninths and divide it by three or multiply it by three,0
teacher:Why did you do that,0
teacher:What made you do that;student:So I wrote here I did one third times nine because its 9 to get three and then six is two thirds of nine then I did the two thirds times nine and the three times two is six,0
teacher:Why;student:I dont know,0
teacher:Explain why it matches,0
teacher:How do you know that;student:Four times  Thats the ones we count,0
teacher:Why cant you just change that,0
teacher:to come  up here and Im going to ask you to share what you did and explain why you did it,0
teacher:Okay why did you do that,0
teacher:Explain why you did that,0
teacher:Explain what one is greater than less than and how do you  know,0
teacher:Why do you say that;student:I think the largest one is going to be 15  times 10 to the power of two,0
teacher:Austin whey do you think the orangutan is larger,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:I dont want just taller or shorter I want why,0
teacher:I want why,0
teacher:Okay tell me why James,0
teacher:Tell me why you think that,0
teacher:Connor tell me why,0
teacher:How come;student:I said greater than,0
teacher:Why would they have taken zero,0
teacher:Why do you think thats going to challenge you;student:So they kind of challenge you,0
teacher:How come you know its false,0
teacher:Explain it to me,0
teacher:How come;student:I think thats false,0
teacher:Explain to me why thats false,0
teacher:Explain to me why this is false;student:I,0
teacher:Tell me why,0
teacher:Why do you think this is called an area model,0
teacher:Why would I why am I multiplying 3 times 3,0
teacher:Because its called the what;student:Because of the d,0
teacher:Why is it in fourths Michael uh I mean Mason,0
teacher:Why is it three sixteenths explain it to me,0
teacher:Why would I have to minus anything;student:Then three plus one to make that four,0
teacher:Why do you disagree Charlotte,0
teacher:Can you explain that to Connor,0
teacher:The eight and why did you go to the eight;student:The eight,0
teacher:How come you wrote yours three fourths and two thirds and she wrote hers one third and three fourths,0
teacher:Tell me why you did what you did,0
teacher:Why did you put three fourths down here and two thirds up here,0
teacher:Why did you not do it backwards;student:I did it backward,0
teacher:Why are you not writing Just multiply the numerator and the denominator,0
teacher:Why are you not writing that,0
teacher:Explain to me why you are not writing that method,0
teacher:You got it you got exactly what I wanted you to have but why did you write it the other way,0
teacher:Why would you pick seven ninths and two twelfths;student:Okay now we have to explain this,0
teacher:Why did you do six tenths instead of five tenths,0
teacher:And why would you have used numerator and denominator;student:Numerator and denominator,0
teacher:Why do I have to minus anything,0
teacher:Oh why do I add five plus three;student:You add five plus three,0
teacher:So when you explain you need to justify,0
teacher:Oh why do you disagreeNow Leah;student:I disagree now,0
teacher:Do you see why one is bigger than the other,0
teacher:Okay so were going to restate and say I know my answer is reasonable because,0
teacher:Why did you say Ah Desmond,0
teacher:Okay and how do you justify your answer,0
teacher:And why,0
teacher:And so were going to have a discussion about what you think the biggest fraction is and why,0
teacher:And why,0
teacher:What is the biggest fraction and why,0
teacher:And why do you think seven eighths;student:Im thinking maybe seven eighths,0
teacher:Which one of these is closest to a whole and why,0
teacher:Which one of these fractions is close to a whole and why,0
teacher:Which one is closest to a whole and why,0
teacher:Which one did you figure out was the biggest and why,0
teacher:Think about which fraction is closest to a whole and why;student:Yeah,0
teacher:Does anybody else agree and why,0
teacher:What do you guys think and why,0
teacher:Why do you think four fifths,0
teacher:Why is seven eighths the biggest,0
teacher:Im going to actually call us by Max what did you get for number one and why do you think its the biggest,0
teacher:How did you realize it was wrong,0
teacher:Okay why is that the right answer,0
teacher:Explain why you think his answer is correct or incorrect,0
teacher:And why would it be easier,0
teacher:David why does this one look different,0
teacher:Why is it different,0
teacher:Why did you do four plus two and divided it by two;student:We did  four plus two divided it by 2,0
teacher:Why would I divide it by two;student:Divide it by two,0
teacher:Why five;student:Five  times,0
teacher:Why is this not working,0
teacher:I want you to look at the emperors penguin and why does it start with that,0
teacher:How do you know;student:48 and a half inches,0
teacher:Explain why;student:I was thinking but now that Im saying it,0
teacher:Why would we have multiplied;student:I just didnt know if you were supposed to multiply it but now I do so its,0
teacher:So based  on your first look at these animal line plots do you think a typical chimpanzee and red kangaroo would be taller or shorter than a fifth grader in your class and why,0
teacher:Why do you think its taller,0
teacher:Why would you add them and not multiply them;student:93 plus 81  1008 and divide it by Im not very good at divisions divide it by what,0
teacher:But  why do I have to subtract anything;student:To get equal towers,0
teacher:Okay and how do you know its bigger;student:What I said it will work because zero point 95 is bigger than 03,0
teacher:How do you know 9500ths is bigger,0
teacher:What do you think,0
teacher:How can you justify that,0
teacher:Why or Why not,0
teacher:And Carter do you have an example to justify why it wont work that way,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:How can you justify who used more,0
teacher:How can you be prepared to justify your answer,0
teacher:How did you justify,0
teacher:and then how did you justify it,0
teacher:And how do you know its bigger,0
teacher:Why does it not work that way;student:Hold on,0
teacher:Why did we do it that way,0
teacher:Heres what I noticed walking around the room is that the majority of you did number one first or number two first because why,0
teacher:explain to the kids,0
teacher:Why did you do eight divided by two buddy;student:So first I did 8 divided by two plus three,0
teacher:How come you cut it into thirds;student:I solved this what I did a pizza and I cut it into thirds,0
teacher:Why halves darling;student:Halfs,0
teacher:Why third;student:Thirds,0
teacher:Why fifths;student:Fifths,0
teacher:Adam why 15ths;student:Three fifteenths,0
teacher:I need you to explain how you know,0
teacher:so if you jump to eight How did you know that the the numerator had to be four;student:Um four eighths,0
teacher:How did you know that,0
teacher:How do I know Zoe,0
teacher:And how do you know,0
teacher:Okay so why only five Sixths;student:Maybe first we could estimate five sixth to a whole,0
teacher:Why did you use 15 Remy;student:What I did was I used 15,0
teacher:Okay and how did you know that was correct;student:for six divided by three I got two,0
teacher:And how did you come up How did you verify that;student:I got 20,0
teacher:Explain to me what expression you wrote And why;student:Yes,0
teacher:Why did you do eight divided by two buddy;student:So first I did 8 divided by two plus three,0
teacher:How come you cut it into thirds;student:I solved this what I did a pizza and I cut it into thirds,0
teacher:Why halves darling;student:Halfs,0
teacher:Why third;student:Thirds,0
teacher:Why fifths;student:Fifths,0
teacher:Adam why 15ths;student:Three fifteenths,0
teacher:Explain to me what expression you wrote And why;student:Yes,0
teacher:Explain why it makes better sense now;student:Yes,0
teacher:Why did you know to put the decimal after the four Julia,0
teacher:Explain the reasoning that youre missing on this okay,0
teacher:Why is it wrong;student:The second one is wrong,0
teacher:Why would I say proud;student:Whatd we do,0
teacher:Why doesnt it make sense to have a remainder,0
teacher:Why do I need the year were in right now;student:The year were in right now,0
teacher:Why am I using this though;student:Then you can just minus 21 and then 2000 year 20 and then if you minus 20 you get 19,0
teacher:Why did you count by twos,0
teacher:Why did you choose to count by 10,0
teacher:How come 11 Josh,0
teacher:Tell me why 10 to the power of seven;student:10 to the power of seven,0
teacher:Why 3000 versus 1000;student:3000,0
teacher:Why do you think problems like five times 40 are called extended multiplication facts,0
teacher:Explain how you did it and why you did what you did,0
teacher:Why do you think problems like five times 40 are called extended multiplication facts,0
teacher:Why 2000,0
teacher:Because I have two zeros though why is it not just 200 Landon,0
teacher:Why one;student:One,0
teacher:Why did you put the 20 and the 6 there;student:I started by putting the 20 and the 6 right there,0
teacher:Why did you draw a line here,0
teacher:Why dont you draw a line there,0
teacher:But the funny part about this is I never knew until I started teaching math why put the zero there,0
teacher:And then Im going to go to Zoe and then Im going to go to Maddy and your job is to explain your thinking and reasoning for doing what you did on your paper,0
teacher:How did you know that your top was a whole,0
teacher:How did you know,0
teacher:Explain that please,0
teacher:And why,0
teacher:So why did you pick four fourths to start;student:I said four fourths but I think its one fourth because each person would get one,0
teacher:Okay and why did you do 112 kiddo;student:112,0
teacher:Because where why would I use three as my numerator and my denominator,0
teacher:Why are you using a check mark;student:Check marks,0
teacher:Why would you do three;student:How would you do two on this side,0
teacher:Why;student:I agree with him,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:Why would two zero be zero zero,0
teacher:Tell your shoulder partner what you did what you wrote and how you knew you needed to write that,0
teacher:Why did you use the word grid,0
teacher:Why;student:I,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why did you not change it;student:It is,0
teacher:Why is it ninefourths,0
teacher:Why could I do easy subtraction in problem one;student:But in problem two,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:So how come you carried the one,0
teacher:How come you carried the one,0
teacher:How come you carried the one,0
teacher:Okay so explain why you carried that one Austin,0
teacher:But also how come thats wrong,0
teacher:Michael why do you disagree with that,0
teacher:All right and why did you get 32,0
teacher:Discuss what you did with your partner and why,0
teacher:How did you know to divide when it said multiply here;student:Yes,0
teacher:How did you know to divide,0
teacher:explain to me why I cant just subtract this,0
teacher:Why do you think,0
teacher:Okay so explain why you thought it was closest to;student:Because I thought it was closest,0
teacher:But why couldnt you have just gone;student:But you werent,0
teacher:Why;student:He said he used ten as the denominator,0
teacher:Why would I put two;student:And then another way is,0
teacher:Why is it two,0
teacher:How do you know,0
teacher:Explain to me why Dans is taller,0
teacher:So Jackson Why is the first one between one and two,0
teacher:Why is it two and one half,0
teacher:He had it but then he forgot the other one Explain to him why its two and one half,0
teacher:why not;student:No,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:And why,0
teacher:So why did you say that was a half,0
teacher:So why did you say no;student:I got the same answer as her,0
teacher:Why 3;student:Okay so what I did is I would draw three squares,0
teacher:Okay now why cant you figure out what fraction this represents by just counting the pieces,0
teacher:Why am I adding 15;student:I said add 15,0
teacher:Why three tenths;student:Three tenths,0
teacher:Hey guys why are you done with this one and my friend here is not,0
teacher:Explain how you knew that;student:I said closest to one,0
teacher:Explain how you knew that;student:One and a half,0
teacher:Why;student:is maybe Dans a little bit,0
teacher:Why did that not work the way that I thought it was going to,0
teacher:So why wouldnt this have been,0
teacher:When we went this way why cant we go that way,0
teacher:Okay so why did you not just put 11 fourths down there;student:I got 114ths ofr my mixed number,0
teacher:How come,0
teacher:Okay so why did you do fourfour;student:Leave it alone,0
teacher:No because why Anna,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:How do you know,0
teacher:Yes is Suma correct that angle B is larger than A or no and why do you think that is,0
teacher:Mia why,0
teacher:Write the name on your dry erase boards what kind of angle is this and how do you know,0
teacher:How do you know,0
teacher:What kind of angle is it and how do you know,0
teacher:What kind of angle is this and how do you know,0
teacher:Can anyone explain why,0
teacher:Who can explain why using that wedge,0
teacher:And how do you know its more than 90 degrees;student:He said the other one is also obtuse because its more than 90 degrees,0
teacher:What are you learning and why,0
teacher:I want a reason why,0
teacher:Stand up if you think that you get the same answer both ways and I want to know a why,0
teacher:Its true Logan why would I get the same answer doing it this way or this way,0
teacher:Why would that make it easy in your head Dan,0
teacher:Why did you change it to subtraction;student:Yes,0
teacher:Why;student:Agree,0
teacher:How can you see that in the graph,0
teacher:Okay why do you think they hit their growth spurt earlier;student:I said they hit their growth spurt earlier,0
teacher:Why are you saying that,0
teacher:Why do you think this years class is taller,0
teacher:Why are they different,0
teacher:Mia why;student:You get 6 x,0
teacher:Why not;student:No,0
teacher:Why did you change it to hundredths,0
teacher:How did you know it was three and fourfifths,0
teacher:Why do I have a line going this way and that way,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why did you miss that,0
teacher:When we multiply a whole number by a fraction less than one such as 6  23 was the product greater than or less than the whole number and why,0
teacher:Is it going to be Why less than,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:How come;student:It will be greater than,0
teacher:Why would you do 20,0
teacher:Why are you not using 10s to estimate;student:Yes,0
teacher:Why wouldnt you have just done 41;student:We did 1  41  41 because we rounded,0
teacher:Why do you think that less than two out of every three high school juniors got that question right and you guys were all like,0
teacher:Judy tell me what one you are able to estimate very quickly to determine what equal 308 and why,0
teacher:Why did you place your decimal over here,0
teacher:Explain why you knew that,0
teacher:Go ahead Roberto show us what you did and explain why you did what you did,0
teacher:All right so Im going to have Martin come first and explain what he chose for number two and why,0
teacher:Why dont you put a zero in front of that one;student:Yes because seventh,0
teacher:Why would I do a 4 there,0
teacher:How do you know that,0
teacher:Why did you do 42x3,0
teacher:Why did you star that;student:What I starred was I meant most about this part I starred there,0
teacher:Why did he do 18   2;student:James did 18   9  2,0
teacher:How did you know theres two wholes;student:I did two wholes and onefourth,0
teacher:First of all how you did it and why you knew it,0
teacher:Marco why;student:No,0
teacher:Why do fractions in which the bottom wins does this happen to the graph,0
teacher:You dont have to say what the equation of that is just why does that sort of behavior happen,0
teacher:Okay so why,0
teacher:why is whichever way we do it They The answer is the same,0
teacher:Jessie How do you know that,0
teacher:Why do you think I start with that,0
teacher:Why do you think I start with my largest place value to figure out what I am putting into each person,0
teacher:Finely what do you what do you think,0
teacher:Why do you think this isnt a wrong but you really cant be wrong with this answer,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Becky I wonder if you can explain why you say three,0
teacher:Why does each person get three pieces,0
teacher:eight pieces Why;student:eight,0
teacher:Ah the numerator is two why is the numerator two;student:So you would divide them by three and on the denominator for that is two on the I mean the numerator,0
teacher:How do you know that,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why;student:Onetwelfth,0
teacher:Why;student:Onethird,0
teacher:Why;student:Mmhmm,0
teacher:Why;student:So the leastest is twohundredths,0
teacher:How do I know that three over two is more than one,0
teacher:How do I know that three over two is more than one,0
teacher:How do you know that three over two is more than one whole,0
teacher:Why is it mixed number,0
teacher:Why not;student:And youre not going to get the um Youre not going to get a different answer,0
teacher:Why;student:nine,0
teacher:Michael Why is it nine;student:Me,0
teacher:June how do you know that,0
teacher:Why;student:For this one when the denominator is bigger than the top we realize that when thing is divided is getting really closer and closer to zero but its never going to meet,0
teacher:Tell me why you narrowed it down from A and B;student:I knew it couldnt be A and it couldn t be B so I said it was D,0
teacher:Why does the butterfly wing has to be in that quadrant,0
teacher:Okay why,0
teacher:No why cant it be there,0
teacher:Why would those change but not those,0
teacher:Why would I waste your time with this,0
teacher:Why does that have to be equal to one,0
teacher:Then you go and you look for your multiple choice answers and you dont see it why,0
teacher:Yes or no and why;student:Yes it does,0
teacher:Why does the cosine of theta equal to negative cosine of 180 plus theta,0
teacher:Why when the top of the bottom of the fraction have the same growth rate because this happened and you three groups are incharge of why does this happen,0
teacher:Who wants to come up and say why this one has to be true,0
teacher:Ah okay Royce can you explain to me why its to 320 and not 360;student:I mean 320,0
teacher:Oh 2400 How do you know that River,0
teacher:Why did you come up with 540 divided by 9,0
teacher:Can you tell me why;student:I agree with Camille,0
teacher:Why does it surprise you Dakota;student:It surprises me,0
teacher:Miriam can you explain why you agree,0
teacher:Why do you say no,0
teacher:Mason tell me why you disagree;student:I disagree,0
teacher:Haven why can we not do that,0
teacher:Okay so do we know how to do this now,0
teacher:30 times 20 and 30 times five,0
teacher:How do you know,0
teacher:Who can support an answer for why they think we will clap on the same beat or why you think we wont clap on the same beat,0
teacher:Do you understand why;student:Yes,0
teacher:Why would I not be able to do this;student:Because of those,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:Why 16 grids;student:16 grids,0
teacher:I have a question why did you put a zero there;student:We first wrote the numbers and then we started off with  it cant be zero minus one so we,0
teacher:There was no zero in the problem why do you put a zero there,0
teacher:Why couldnt I then have just written the problem out if it was 948,0
teacher:Why couldnt I have just subtracted 7291 from 9408,0
teacher:Why did you change your answer,0
teacher:Why am I crossing that out,0
teacher:Why did you make that six a three,0
teacher:Honey why did you  all the way over to the six,0
teacher:Why do I have to have a common denominator Clay in order to add and subtract fractions,0
teacher:How come;student:We were finding that  that our answers werent the same,0
teacher:Explain to me why you said half,0
teacher:Why;student:Yes,0
teacher:One person do one one person do two one person do three so on and then talk about which one was the easiest to do mentally and why,0
teacher:Becca show me what you thought was the easiest and why,0
teacher:Kellen which one did you think was easiest and come and show us why,0
teacher:Why;student:Whole,0
teacher:Explain to me why,0
teacher:Explain to me why you said seven Alexandria,0
teacher:Why 10th;student:10th,0
teacher:Why six times three;student:There is going to be six times three,0
teacher:Why did you do two plus nine Clay,0
teacher:Why would you round it to eight;student:899,0
teacher:Tell me why you did it,0
teacher:Why didnt you carry your one on that side,0
teacher:How do we know what the size of the pieces are,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:Why not;student:No,0
teacher:Why;student:You would have to do more than double eight,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why would I add the X coordinate and the Y coordinate;student:Now  multiply by,0
teacher:Why not,0
teacher:Why would it have been harder Finn;student:Harder,0
teacher:How come I could not Bruce,0
teacher:Why are you using check marks;student:Yes Im on,0
teacher:If thats Thats  why would you have gone  there,0
teacher:Why cant you;student:I cant do minus 23,0
teacher:You know why;student:Not exactly,0
teacher:Explain to her why,0
teacher:Can you explain to her why she was,0
teacher:Help her to understand why she shouldnt;student:We could do it on this side,0
teacher:If Im subtracting and I color and then I color over why did I color over;student:Give,0
teacher:Missy what numbers are you using and why are you making boxes,0
teacher:Why would you write one;student:Ones,0
teacher:Why is it not hundredths and not tens;student:That one two and 49 hundredth,0
teacher:Why is it 100 honey,0
teacher:Okay so why did you put the decimal when you added 4  2  6;student:The I did 3  8 which is eleven and then 5  1 which is 9 and then  right here,0
teacher:Why did you put a decimal,0
teacher:Why am I keeping it Georgia;student:You could keep it,0
teacher:Grocery shopping why do you revise things grocery shopping;student:Grocery shopping,0
teacher:Why couldnt I do this,0
teacher:Okay explain to me why;student:The first one was easy,0
teacher:WInnie why is it only going to become a six;student:Sissixths plus twosixths,0
teacher:Why am I changing that Gerald;student:3x4,0
teacher:Okay pick someone Frankie to explain why,0
teacher:Why not;student:No,0
teacher:What operation will you use why and what will your answer be,0
teacher:I need to know what mathematical process you would use why and how much of his allowance did he spend;student:We said it was three because three,0
teacher:This is what I was just waiting to see explain why it works now Nivea,0
teacher:Okay Kayla Im going to ask you to explain why you had a thumbs down;student:I had a thumbs down,0
teacher:Gabby Im going to ask you to explain why you had a thumbs up,0
teacher:How come 33;student:Normally in my head I would think of so its a whole so I will think of 78 x 33,0
teacher:Explain that to me,0
teacher:Explain why you thought it was down go over to the board if you need to;student:I thought it was up,0
teacher:How come;student:I thought it was less than because of 23 you multiply the denominator by the denominator which is 24 and then the numerator by the numerator which is 14 and 1424 is less than 78,0
teacher:How come its less than 78,0
teacher:What would you do differently,0
teacher:Why 8   14 and you can call on someone if youre not sure why 8   14 versus 14   8;student:Eight,0
teacher:Why would I do 2 14,0
teacher:Come back write down what you think because you have to talk to one another now what numbers would you use and why,0
teacher:Why would you use those numbers to make this line plot,0
teacher:Why does it make sense to use those numbers,0
teacher:Then you need to be discussing what numbers would you use and why do you think you would use those,0
teacher:Each of you are now coming up with numbers you would use in a line plot and why would you use those numbers,0
teacher:Why 14;student:4 14,0
teacher:Why wouldnt I just be able to go 34,0
teacher:Why is it not a bad thing,0
teacher:Why did you do eight fifths,0
teacher:Why that,0
teacher:Why;student:The numerator and the denominator have to be the same,0
teacher:45 why did we get 445,0
teacher:Why if I times two;student:It was 23 instead of 13 so you have to divide it by two,0
teacher:Why if I times 2 and 25 by 2 am I not just going to come out with 425,0
teacher:Clay you showed me what you were going to do why did you do it wrong,0
teacher:You said Im going to fold it like this thats the long way so why would you not fold it in that way;student:No because now it looks like a book,0
teacher:Why would I fold it into fourths when shes only eating 23 of it;student:Fourths,0
teacher:Why would I do it in fourths shes only eating 23 of it,0
teacher:Why am I coloring in two,0
teacher:Explain why I would do a half first;student:a half,0
teacher:Why 16;student:16,0
teacher:Why do you keep changing it;student:46,0
teacher:Okay so I am agreeing 100 with what youre saying at zero Im agreeing but Im questioning why;student:Our group disagreed because some of us did 110 and then Tony had gotten 010 and then Becky got 210,0
teacher:Why is 57 in there,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:What do you think,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why do you think they will be the same,0
teacher:Why did you have to do 3 x 3;student:5   15 is thee and 3 x 3 is nine,0
teacher:Why do mathematicFrancs use models to solve problems and answer questions,0
teacher:Why does it make sense that a fraction with the same numerator and denominator equal one;student:Same both,0
teacher:Why does that make sense,0
teacher:Why does that make sense,0
teacher:Why does that make sense,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:Why you think we will or why you think we wont,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:Why you think this is LCM,0
teacher:Can I get somebody to explain how you knew,0
teacher:And how did you know Anna,0
teacher:So why how do you know that its closer to zero,0
teacher:Would anybody like to show the thinking,0
teacher:Okay why;student:After you after you get your answer,0
teacher:Okay so Im asking to justify how do you know its closer to zero,0
teacher:So how are you going to explain that,0
teacher:How did you know its between two and three,0
teacher:Sophia and you tell us why,0
teacher:How do we know that,0
teacher:How do you know the 7 is 7000;student:Because I know that the eight is worth 800 and the 9 is worth 90 and the zeros worth 0 and the seven is 7000,0
teacher:Okay so Caleb would you mind explaining why do you think it is,0
teacher:And then you you can add the fractions once Why would we need equivalent fractions to add fractions,0
teacher:Any ideas,0
teacher:Why do we need to know how to make equivalent fractions if were adding fractions,0
teacher:Could you explain to us why how do you know that three fourths is bigger than one half,0
teacher:How did you know two fourths was a half;student:Because two fourths is a half so,0
teacher:And how do you do How did you know how to figure,0
teacher:Landon can you explain to us how you know two thirds is greater than a half,0
teacher:Hey Joey can you tell us how you knew that 14 plus two fourths was bigger than a half;student:I figures out to  down because I was doing this,0
teacher:How do you know that;student:One fourth plus two fourths is three fourths equals bigger than one half,0
teacher:Chase do you feel like telling us why,0
teacher:Howd you know,0
teacher:How come,0
teacher:Okay so tell me tell me where you come up here and point to it and then who can explain how they knew,0
teacher:Why;student:No,0
teacher:Why cant we add these and these parts,0
teacher:And why do they have to have a common denominator,0
teacher:So why would this Why did that work,0
teacher:Why did that work,0
teacher:Why do you think that works,0
teacher:Why would that not create the largest quotient,0
teacher:Why doesnt it work,0
teacher:Why;student:I solved 96 divided by 3 its 63 divided by 9 is 7,0
teacher:Why would we make a rule that says that,0
teacher:Why;student:My rule would be that the largest number in the dividend,0
teacher:Yeah why;student:and the smaller numbers in the divisor,0
teacher:Why would you want the smallest divisor,0
teacher:Okay Aiden do you want to tell us,0
teacher:Why did you do that,0
teacher:We need to tell why why does it work,0
teacher:So just like an answer in the homework why does it work,0
teacher:Why does it work,0
teacher:Why do you think its important;student:Yes,0
teacher:Why do you think its important,0
teacher:On so that why;student:Test us,0
teacher:So if you gave me that that explanation Id be like How do you know,0
teacher:If I was a second grader and I was precocious Id be like how do you know,0
teacher:Does anybody agree with her and can somebody else give us a reason why,0
teacher:Okay so why how do you know you can add the numerators;student:Id start with adding,0
teacher:Why not,0
teacher:Explain why the rule works,0
teacher:How did you know that one was greater than a half plus a third,0
teacher:Anybody want to explain why,0
teacher:How do you know what a fourth is,0
teacher:Josh how come,0
teacher:How do you know,0
teacher:How do you know Julian,0
teacher:All right Austin how do you know,0
teacher:So what happened when you did you ever double the second one,0
teacher:So what happened to sailboat number two,0
teacher:So if you double the first coordinate what do you think its going to look like,0
teacher:And remember you did those sailboats where you doubled the first coordinate what did that look like,0
teacher:How did that change it,0
teacher:So if you just double the first coordinate what do you think is going to happen to the sailboat,0
teacher:Then what is it going to do to it,0
teacher:How do you know Ethan,0
teacher:So what was your guess about what the new trapezoid is going to be,0
teacher:Why did you think that,0
teacher:So how did you know for sure that the new trapezoid was different in that way,0
teacher:What would happen to the shape of it,0
teacher:Whats going to happen to the trapezoid if we triple the second coordinate and leave the first one the same,0
teacher:How did you know it was correct,0
teacher:What were the steps that you took to figure out what the trapezoid would look like and how did you prove it,0
teacher:Why did that one come over there,0
teacher:So can anybody tell me why those of you why do you disagree with me Eli,0
teacher:Landon why dont you agree with me,0
teacher:Why do you agree that this is an LCM problem;student:I agree,0
teacher:Why;student:And it has to be over here,0
teacher:What was your guess,0
teacher:Why do we need to find common denominators,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:So what you should have noticed is that you could draw a straight line through Lilith and Noahs ages and why is there a straight line relationship Fletcher,0
teacher:How do you know what a fourth is,0
teacher:Okay tell me how you know for sure what a fourth is;student:Because,0
teacher:And someone who is willing to explain how they know their sum is correct,0
teacher:How do you know youre correct;student:What I did was 5 sixths plus 2 sixths equals 7 sixths,0
teacher:And how do you know its true,0
teacher:How do you know that thats correct,0
teacher:Sonotice how we know that this number one person gets this piece and this piece and two gets this piece in this piece,0
teacher:Lets see Sophia why do you think its two,0
teacher:So Caleb can you explain why its 90,0
teacher:Howd you know,0
teacher:And do you want to show us how you know,0
teacher:Caleb can you tell us how you knew,0
teacher:Or do you want to just tell us,0
teacher:Why would that ended up being 11 no matter what,0
teacher:Because on the grid this will be 11 no matter what because on the grid what,0
teacher:Okay who can find why,0
teacher:Whats your explanation,0
teacher:And how did you know,0
teacher:Who would like to explain that one,0
teacher:Anybody want to try and justify that,0
teacher:anybody feel strongly that it should be a half,0
teacher:So why are those skills relevant,0
teacher:The answer is no but why,0
teacher:Nope why did you put that,0
teacher:Because;student:What I see is 00 and these add this was six and five is eleven,0
teacher:Okay so the first one why do we need to find common denominators,0
teacher:What is the explanation for it being 11 no matter what no matter what route,0
teacher:Why can we do that,0
teacher:Can you tell us why you think its false;student:Yes,0
teacher:Can you tell us why you think the first one might be true,0
teacher:Okay tell us why you think this one is true;student:The third one that one,0
teacher:Why did you pick four;student:You can get 25 you can get hundred divided by four,0
teacher:I would like for somebody to expand a little bit on how we know that a quarter is 14 of a dollar,0
teacher:Now why are we going to use a ratio table this time around instead of long division,0
teacher:Why would that be our preferred strategy,0
teacher:Gray what are your thoughts,0
teacher:Archer what are your thoughts,0
teacher:Tell us why;student:Would it be part to part to whole,0
teacher:Why are you thinking its part to part to whole,0
teacher:So can you tell us one more time why you think that Mai got the better workout,0
teacher:Does someone want to tell us why we can do 25 over 100,0
teacher:How do you know that its 34s,0
teacher:For the green one what percent is shaded in and how do you know,0
teacher:How did you know that it was 50;student:I said 50,0
teacher:Why do you say ten,0
teacher:Right that is a great strategy why did you do 9 times 4;student:Yeah I did 9 times 4,0
teacher:I want you to think to yourself why do we have to find a common denominator when we add fractions,0
teacher:Please tell your partner why we need to find a common denominator when we And itll be real fast you have one minute,0
teacher:Why do we need to find a common denominator when we add fractions,0
teacher:How come you agree;student:I agree,0
teacher:How come you agree;student:I agree,0
teacher:Well how do you know thats correct;student:I agree,0
teacher:How do you know thats right;student:I agree,0
teacher:Do you want so support your answer,0
teacher:I feel like 30 miles isnt going to make sense because Sophie why do you think that 30 miles wouldnt make sense,0
teacher:How come;student:Probably the cat,0
teacher:Adriana why did you think this LCM,0
teacher:Or why did you think it was GCF,0
teacher:Why;student:thats what Im trying to do is change the denominator into a 6,0
teacher:Do you want to add anything for why you thought it was GCF,0
teacher:And why did you think this was LCM,0
teacher:Oh tell us why;student:I actually think its GCF now,0
teacher:Abrahm can you tell us why you think that the two and the four are switched in the first two ratio statements,0
teacher:How do you know that thats true,0
teacher:Edith how do you know that that ones true;student:I love school,0
teacher:How come you disagree,0
teacher:Tell us why you agree,0
teacher:How come the dog gets more treats,0
teacher:How come,0
teacher:How do you know;student:Four,0
teacher:So we could go back to the first column and why did you pick six;student:You could multiply one and eight times by six,0
teacher:How do you know that thats correct;student:I agree,0
teacher:How do we know that thats true Jericho,0
teacher:I want you to think about which koolaid you would like to have and why,0
teacher:Which koolaid mixture you would like to have and why,0
teacher:Angelina would you prefer mixture A or mixture B and why,0
teacher:How do you know that theyre equal,0
teacher:And why would you do that;student:Like double it,0
teacher:How come;student:I think 25 is too high,0
teacher:Well how come you need a little more than 10;student:You need a little bit more than 10 to buy them,0
teacher:How do you know;student:Thats true,0
teacher:Because;student:I was thinking maybe it would be 23,0
teacher:How come;student:Mixture B,0
teacher:Looking at this model how do you guys know those of you who are really interested in the multiplication piece how would you know that you can use nine times three,0
teacher:What do you think Rylee,0
teacher:Why did you say this was not a function,0
teacher:And Im going to want someone to explain why it is or is not a function,0
teacher:Okay so why are we doing this,0
teacher:Why Why are we bothering to learn this in a geometry class,0
teacher:So for these four examples were going to talk about how do we know that theyre the same,0
teacher:Or how do we know that theyre not the same,0
teacher:Whats our reason,0
teacher:And whats your reason,0
teacher:And same three sides whats our reason,0
teacher:How do you know that Diego,0
teacher:Anybody feeling brave and want to explain why this is or is not a function,0
teacher:How come,0
teacher:If they are we need to explain why,0
teacher:For what reason Are they similar,0
teacher:Why did we even do this,0
teacher:How do you know,0
teacher:How do you know,0
teacher:Okay so Why did you say less than,0
teacher:So does anybody have the fancy reason why you know that its equal,0
teacher:Because;student:Yes,0
teacher:How come nine times three would work;student:Couldnt you just do nine times three because its 13 so you would multiply nine times three,0
teacher:All right do I have any brave so who want to explain why they answered the way they did,0
teacher:So why is that bigger,0
teacher:When I draw this line line,0
teacher:Tell us why it doesnt just go down by one every time,0
teacher:Okay Whats another reason,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Do you know why that works,0
teacher:Stetson what are you thinking,0
teacher:How do you know that its half;student:I was just going to say that its half,0
teacher:Why is always three,0
teacher:Why does that make sense in this situation,0
teacher:Did you think more about why the multiplication piece makes sense;student:Sorry,0
teacher:Did you think more about why the division works,0
teacher:Why do you think the division works,0
teacher:Did you think more about why multiplying and then dividing would work,0
teacher:Why did you divide it in half,0
teacher:How come,0
teacher:Dallas is a faster runner because,0
teacher:Did you think more about why multiplying and then dividing would work;student:Hmm,0
teacher:Dallas is the faster runner because,0
teacher:Explain your  reasoning,0
teacher:And why is this an undefined slope with what we talked about on Tuesday,0
teacher:Tell me why you picked three;student:When I came up with this I just thought of for Diegos you just multiple 47 and three times three and the tickets nine and the cost is 141,0
teacher:They paid the same rate because;student:Put four,0
teacher:They paid the same rate because,0
teacher:How do you know they have the same rate,0
teacher:So what I want to talk about on this one is why is this a slope of zero,0
teacher:So crew under question number two in your packet I want you to answer Dallas is the faster runner because,0
teacher:And Ill let people take a look at that and see if they understand why are we replacing s instead of n in this problem,0
teacher:Right Florian,1
teacher:Annabelle,1
teacher:Amoura,1
teacher:I have 56 correct,1
teacher:Eight piles with seven little cubes in each of them there would be 56 little cubes correct,1
teacher:So if we were to count up we would get a different number right,1
teacher:Id have seven of these right;student:Seven,1
teacher:Bruno,1
teacher:Instead of seven of these,1
teacher:Angelina,1
teacher:So I would have seven cubes in my hand right,1
teacher:Do we have the same number of piles in both questions,1
teacher:Right Francis,1
teacher:Who havent I heard from yet,1
teacher:We have seven little cubes right;student:Seven,1
teacher:Florian,1
teacher:How many of you think number two is right the way Ive written it,1
teacher:TWO,1
teacher:How many of you knew what seven times eight was raise your hand,1
teacher:HUH,1
teacher:Okay how many of you think you got the right answer,1
teacher:So thats what this would look like right,1
teacher:56 plus zero right,1
teacher:The answers just 56 isnt it,1
teacher:Now if we think about base ten blockswhat were talking about is the difference in these correct,1
teacher:We said seven times eight is 56 right,1
teacher:Huh;student:So you just take the zero and add it to the end of the number,1
teacher:Carrington,1
teacher:Clark,1
teacher:Am I right,1
teacher:I just put a zero on it just because you said to put a zero on it;student:You just put it after and dont put any single,1
teacher:Mr Clyde,1
teacher:Anybody think number ones wrong,1
teacher:So Im right,1
teacher:That one pile is bigger than our entire answer in the first problem right,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:56 right,1
teacher:Were good now right,1
teacher:Arabella,1
teacher:All right so ladies and gentlemen does that make sense now,1
teacher:That is a complete sentence right,1
teacher:40 but she only added one zero in right,1
teacher:Yes Florian,1
teacher:Are there any questions,1
teacher:Hadley and I are now ready to play okay,1
teacher:Does your sheet look just like what Ive written on the board,1
teacher:Remember I said its important were going be focused today,1
teacher:Does the board look exactly like whats on your sheet,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you got the answer;student:So super duper easy,1
teacher:Hudson you ready,1
teacher:If you think Hadley is going to win you will copy what Hadley has okay,1
teacher:In real life if Fox was going against Avah Avah has her sheet Fox has her sheet okay,1
teacher:Clark,1
teacher:Thank youHow many of you like my sentence,1
teacher:80 times;student:I kept counting up by five,1
teacher:Talk to them;student:Im gonna start with 80 times five,1
teacher:Were gonna have a five and a six right,1
teacher:Finely,1
teacher:Caspien,1
teacher:For partial products yes what were gonna do is break them into their place values which means their all gonna have zeros added to the end of them kay,1
teacher:This is only for problems that are just single digit by single digit other than zeros does that make sense,1
teacher:Any other questions,1
teacher:So this is called multiplication puzzles and what I would like you to do is try to you know how weve been looking for patterns lately in everything,1
teacher:So you know how we counted up by sevens here,1
teacher:Crosby,1
teacher:Finely,1
teacher:Thats exactly what your question says correct,1
teacher:And we get the same thing we had up on the board earlier right;student:Ohhhh,1
teacher:Analies,1
teacher:Finely,1
teacher:Caspien,1
teacher:Any questions about how I got any of those,1
teacher:Good so its the exact same thing right;student:In the  box it counts up by 2000,1
teacher:So shall we begin,1
teacher:Its the same unknown,1
teacher:Finely,1
teacher:So the question Mark yesterday represented our unknown right,1
teacher:In this case its a number right,1
teacher:So were assuming its a person right,1
teacher:Doesnt make sense right,1
teacher:The second number we add together to make our total right,1
teacher:Yeah because all I did was a fact family right,1
teacher:Aisha you cant figure out that unknown,1
teacher:Alani you cant figure out that unknown;student:No,1
teacher:Huh,1
teacher:So six is going into our robots head right,1
teacher:Elliot,1
teacher:It wants to say 12 right,1
teacher:So we have four possible operations right,1
teacher:Its getting bigger right;student:Bigger,1
teacher:Well unfortunately we dont yet because can we use both addition and subtraction to make a six into a 12,1
teacher:So what were looking for here is remember how we did this in yesterdays lesson,1
teacher:If were going to add were going to add six right,1
teacher:We already know that because its right here right,1
teacher:Remember I told you replacing numbers with letters and symbols,1
teacher:So I want you to take these minute and 50 seconds now and I want you to use it to work on number six okay,1
teacher:and go,1
teacher:Does that make sense to everybody what we have done so far,1
teacher:Argo,1
teacher:And oh and 13 am I wrong,1
teacher:Would you guys agree with that,1
teacher:You with me,1
teacher:Give me a thumbs up if that makes sense,1
teacher:Did you guys see what you did;student:I knew I was missing something because I just realized that as soon as you put the as soon as you did the denominators I knew what I did wrong,1
teacher:Did you have a question Duke;student:I cant see,1
teacher:But you see what you did wrong;student:No Im not inauidble,1
teacher:How about you since youre the one who was just confused,1
teacher:So did you hear that Duke;student:and then you have to  take the whole and then make it to eight and then subtract it,1
teacher:So Adeline if I put that problem on the board could you solve it,1
teacher:Two right;student:Equals two,1
teacher:But more importantly all Im trying to get to is the simple fact of you all knew that the answer to this was two but isnt the answer to this four,1
teacher:So both of those will give us the answer we are looking for right,1
teacher:Can we multiply by two,1
teacher:Can we multiply by two,1
teacher:Does it work;student:Its times 12,1
teacher:Because could we add six plus 12,1
teacher:Could we add seven plus 12,1
teacher:Will we get answers,1
teacher:Can we use fourth grade terminology;student:Times five,1
teacher:Are you guys starting to understand why I say how important it is for you to understand your multiplication facts,1
teacher:So any questions about in and out boxes before we move on to some practice today,1
teacher:Good but basic right;student:Uh factors multiples,1
teacher:Carrington,1
teacher:Van,1
teacher:Cade,1
teacher:Caspien,1
teacher:So does it matter what place value its in,1
teacher:Are you sure,1
teacher:Is it even a number;student:Is that even a number,1
teacher:Alexia,1
teacher:Itd be cool if all this just stuck right in your brain without you having to do anything any light bulbs going off over brains right now after you finish those two questions,1
teacher:Is that going to work,1
teacher:So weve already got our first number figured out right,1
teacher:Huh,1
teacher:Raise your hand Aliza,1
teacher:Emmerson,1
teacher:If we put three into the ear and we add six will it give us nine,1
teacher:And we have those two rows right there that are completed correct,1
teacher:Theyre getting smaller right;student:Smaller,1
teacher:Ace,1
teacher:Are you serious;student:Zero,1
teacher:So if we divide 20 by four itll give us five correct,1
teacher:Does it work,1
teacher:So now the question is do you know your facts,1
teacher:Well lets try to do them anyway shall we,1
teacher:Alvin,1
teacher:Because that is the out right;student:In his mouth,1
teacher:Everybody got it,1
teacher:Theres one more clue right,1
teacher:If I put 12 into the ear and I subtract 15 am I going to get three,1
teacher:She took her nine and her six and made 96 okay,1
teacher:Huh;student:Right,1
teacher:Huh,1
teacher:Its onefourth plus onefourth plus onefourth plus onefourth equals fourfourths right,1
teacher:Three people in here can make any sense of that,1
teacher:Its half of the whole right;student:Because its half of the rectangle,1
teacher:When we have onefourth and onefourth do we get onehalf,1
teacher:Leon,1
teacher:It would be twofourths right;student:Twofourths,1
teacher:Knox,1
teacher:Jules,1
teacher:Any questions about that,1
teacher:Kameron,1
teacher:Oneninth plus oneninth plus oneninth I could cut that into nine pieces and I could take four of them right,1
teacher:Helena,1
teacher:Threeninths right;student:Threeninths,1
teacher:We want the amount of threeninths right,1
teacher:Threeninths is shaded in a different color than oneninth right,1
teacher:They take their rectangle and it is broken into four pieces correct,1
teacher:Does oneninth plus onethird equal four ninths,1
teacher:Any questions about last nights homework,1
teacher:Huh;student:A rhombus,1
teacher:I dont believe its teaching math currently but I could be wrong Eliza,1
teacher:Theres the one whole right;student:onefourth and then,1
teacher:Two squares one on top of each other right;student:It looks like two squares,1
teacher:Or you could do side by side but it looks like that right,1
teacher:Yeah its just two of the original ones right;student:Its just two big squares with four of each,1
teacher:Kye,1
teacher:A trapezoid because one whole equals threethirds right;student:Trapezoid,1
teacher:Well fourthirds is the same thing as having a whole one right,1
teacher:Kane,1
teacher:Any questions about that,1
teacher:Guess what,1
teacher:Is it any different than the last question,1
teacher:Yes it was a trapezoid right,1
teacher:Who havent I heard from yet,1
teacher:Johnny,1
teacher:Did you do your homework,1
teacher:And guys look the proof is already up here on the board isnt it,1
teacher:Threeninths right,1
teacher:So if this was threeninths instead of onethird would it work;student:Yes,1
teacher:So Hello,1
teacher:Would everybody agree,1
teacher:Any questions about that one before we move on,1
teacher:Johnny,1
teacher:Can odd numbers be divided by two evenly;student:Its not a question exactly about this but what if you have an odd number and you try to,1
teacher:Mmhmm;student:So you decided to start with three right,1
teacher:Only one person did it different than this,1
teacher:How many of you started with 112,1
teacher:So when I say did you do it different how come your hands werent in the air,1
teacher:One out of six is an equivalent fraction to 212 right,1
teacher:Because we still have a problem right;student:Then I,1
teacher:We cant have three right,1
teacher:All right whats your question Johnny,1
teacher:Ill give you here know what;student:Yes,1
teacher:Remember what I asked who started with 112,1
teacher:It combines them right,1
teacher:When you divide by two normally a whole number it cuts it in half right,1
teacher:We cant have the two in the numerator right;student:The two,1
teacher:Divide my hair down the middle,1
teacher:Now we know that we have to find a common denominator before we add but if we did that it would look just like this wouldnt it,1
teacher:Are we changing the amount,1
teacher:Right theyre equivalent fractions right,1
teacher:Its the same amount right,1
teacher:But are they the same thing,1
teacher:Is onethird the same thing as threeninths,1
teacher:Youre going to add something plus oneeighth because your first little spot there is going to be worth oneeighth right,1
teacher:Jessie,1
teacher:Raise your hand when you think you got it,1
teacher:Two;student:Two,1
teacher:Okay so you did this one,1
teacher:So you colored in the third one now;student:And then I put dots in the third one to represent oneeighth,1
teacher:Okay so just like I have over here;student:Down below I wrote twoeighths and for the third one I wrote oneeighth,1
teacher:Please Kameron,1
teacher:Grace you think you can save us,1
teacher:Divide our class into two,1
teacher:Okay Miss Genevieve,1
teacher:Armani,1
teacher:How many of you think that if I rewrote them neatly Jalen could get it right,1
teacher:How many think our issue is in our multiplication,1
teacher:Remember what we practiced yesterday multiplying by extended facts,1
teacher:Honour are you solving this or are you just going to sit there and hope I did it right,1
teacher:How many of you think I got it right,1
teacher:Avah,1
teacher:See how I made sure everything was lined up in my ones place by drawing that line there,1
teacher:Now could I go even further to make sure I did it right by lining up my place values with lines,1
teacher:Any questions on how any of this works,1
teacher:How many of you think we should probably do another example before you try to do it on your own,1
teacher:Mr Harry you think you can do this on your own right now,1
teacher:Does it matter what order theyre in,1
teacher:Did you do me or Haven,1
teacher:You did Haven,1
teacher:Who did me,1
teacher:Foxs the only one really,1
teacher:Two right;student:Two,1
teacher:Its been used twice see,1
teacher:Are these numbers on the left side of the wall,1
teacher:Huh,1
teacher:Have we done it,1
teacher:Good its worth 60 because it is in the tens place right;student:I would say its worth 60,1
teacher:Haven,1
teacher:Its in the ones place right,1
teacher:Hunter,1
teacher:Donna,1
teacher:Ive already done by tens times my tens right,1
teacher:Avah,1
teacher:Does everybody understand what we just did,1
teacher:Really;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:Theres no question about that,1
teacher:Dash,1
teacher:See your multiplication symbol in the middle,1
teacher:My first is 60 times 60 right,1
teacher:Is everybody seeing that,1
teacher:Now heres the question have we multiplied this 60 by both of our possible numbers over here,1
teacher:Yes right,1
teacher:Are these numbers all on the right side of the wall,1
teacher:Tens ones tens ones right,1
teacher:Daniela does yours look right,1
teacher:Will those be multiples;student:Now were going to write the multiple,1
teacher:Jairo,1
teacher:Jalen,1
teacher:Jimmy switch;student:Im going to take the six again 60 again and then multiply it by five,1
teacher:Youre going to multiply them all together;student:Im going to multiply all of them together but starting with the first one,1
teacher:200 times five times 60 times 40 times 60 times five times five times 40 times five times five,1
teacher:So please proceed Sir,1
teacher:Jairo switch,1
teacher:Jean take over;student:And then that equals 30 and then I add in the one zero,1
teacher:Mr Jean,1
teacher:Jalen,1
teacher:You think its a seven,1
teacher:Because it what;student:Because,1
teacher:See how it starts to get a little crooked,1
teacher:Class,1
teacher:Before we do that remember;student:We write 200,1
teacher:We do our horns;student:Uhmm,1
teacher:Is that going to work on this problem,1
teacher:I will leave this one up as an example for you to see up on the big board okay,1
teacher:Did you follow me or Haven,1
teacher:Does yours look exactly like hers;student:Haven,1
teacher:Dash does yours,1
teacher:Is it okay to rewrite your numbers somewhere else to make sure theyre neat and organized,1
teacher:Did you already add them up,1
teacher:How many of you chose me this time,1
teacher:How many of you chose Haven,1
teacher:How many of you think our issue is in our adding,1
teacher:You think you got it,1
teacher:How many of you came up with the same answer as me,1
teacher:None of you,1
teacher:Harry is four plus zero plus zero plus zero four,1
teacher:Harry is seven plus two plus zero nine,1
teacher:Is six plus three plus one 10,1
teacher:How many of you think youre ready to try it,1
teacher:Are there any questions about how this works,1
teacher:How many of you did mine,1
teacher:Do you guys need more time;student:for number five I got close to 3,1
teacher:So is this a multiplication problem,1
teacher:to get your common denominator;student:So you can either do four goes into three equals 12 or you could multiply them and do well,1
teacher:So basically is our product going to be greater than one,1
teacher:Christina,1
teacher:Stand up and sit down when youre done,1
teacher:Ollie,1
teacher:Bryson,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Bum bum bum,1
teacher:Christina;student:I will,1
teacher:Harold,1
teacher:Kellen,1
teacher:Alaina,1
teacher:Lance,1
teacher:Megan,1
teacher:Remember our last problem was in that pizza example,1
teacher:Classity class;student:One times three is three,1
teacher:So its saying will the product be greater than twothirds;student:Wait,1
teacher:Grant,1
teacher:When we multiply nine times twothirds are we going to get a product thats less than one,1
teacher:Nine times twothirds is going to be greater than twothirds;student:Yes,1
teacher:Classity class,1
teacher:Grant,1
teacher:Grayson,1
teacher:Harold,1
teacher:Right,1
teacher:Madeline;student:I know its not better organized,1
teacher:What;student:T,1
teacher:So can we use multiplication for this number story,1
teacher:Merrill,1
teacher:So if he spent twothirds of his allowance on comic books would that be a multiplication problem;student:So we could figure out what nine divided by half equals what,1
teacher:So will a product be greater than nine,1
teacher:If we do nine times twothirds are we going to get a product that is greater than nine,1
teacher:So if we do nine times twothirds are we going to get a product that is greater than nine,1
teacher:Ollie,1
teacher:Less than  will the product be greater than twothirds,1
teacher:Merrill,1
teacher:Madeline,1
teacher:Harold,1
teacher:Chase,1
teacher:Karla,1
teacher:Mustafa,1
teacher:Karla,1
teacher:Nathaniel,1
teacher:For this problem do we need to know how long 12 yard is,1
teacher:Thats not what the question is asking is it;student:Its not the question,1
teacher:Karla,1
teacher:Classityclass,1
teacher:Oscar,1
teacher:Malcome,1
teacher:Do we need to draw a yard,1
teacher:A perfectly yard long string,1
teacher:Classity class,1
teacher:Peter,1
teacher:Six frogs;student:Six,1
teacher:Who would like to read this problem aloud,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Did you draw two pieces of pita bread,1
teacher:Classityclass,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Where did I get 16 from;student:Wait Ms Koski where did you get the 16 from,1
teacher:Malcome call on someone please,1
teacher:1424;student:1424,1
teacher:Jackie,1
teacher:Karla,1
teacher:This is also an equivalent fraction and its multiplicative identity property;student:78,1
teacher:Classity class,1
teacher:4256;student:4256,1
teacher:Turn and talk to your kneetoknee partner,1
teacher:Katelyn or Laurel,1
teacher:I think Laurel might be able to help;student:So that doesnt make sense,1
teacher:Harmony,1
teacher:Alana;student:And sometimes theres like a hole in the top of the bread where you can put stuff in it,1
teacher:Its what,1
teacher:What did you say,1
teacher:Hunter,1
teacher:Six;student:Six yards of string,1
teacher:Bum bum bum;student:slices of pizza did Leon eat,1
teacher:Huh,1
teacher:Miles;student:8687 is not equal to one so it wouldnt be five if you did it,1
teacher:Its barely lower right;student:I believe that the five would be greater because it is onethe other five times 8687 86 is still one lower than the whole total,1
teacher:Eli,1
teacher:Miles do you  want to give it a go,1
teacher:Kate;student:Multiplication lost it,1
teacher:When you are done put your pencils down,1
teacher:Are there a lot,1
teacher:Brendan,1
teacher:Zachary;student:Two,1
teacher:Savannah;student:Five over five,1
teacher:Natalie;student:Four  over four,1
teacher:Nolan;student:10 over 10,1
teacher:Could we keep going;student:Seven over seven,1
teacher:What did you say;student:Wait what does that mean when it says use the fractions,1
teacher:Briella,1
teacher:Daniel,1
teacher:Greater;student:I think three over four times three is greater than three over four,1
teacher:Comments or agree,1
teacher:Is greater,1
teacher:But this time Everly you paying attention,1
teacher:A half of five is greater than five;student:Yes,1
teacher:Okay Miles,1
teacher:Remember fraction of problems Miles,1
teacher:So my number is five times 12 12 is less than one agree,1
teacher:So is five greater than two and a half,1
teacher:Did I have to solve it to figure it out,1
teacher:Nolan,1
teacher:Brendan,1
teacher:Five times two and 13 is greater than five;student:For B I got that  five times two,1
teacher:Faith,1
teacher:Brendan,1
teacher:Turn and talk to your partner,1
teacher:Hunter;student:So I knew that the 54 five and 54 is greater than 5,1
teacher:Less than,1
teacher:Five times 8687 is greater;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:Jermaine,1
teacher:Christina,1
teacher:Ollie,1
teacher:Baking;student:Also whenever youre baking,1
teacher:Madeline,1
teacher:Home builders;student:If youre a home builder you have to use multiplication,1
teacher:Anorilla,1
teacher:At the grocery store;student:When youre buying certain food and you want to do additions or repeated addition,1
teacher:Harold,1
teacher:Jermaine;student:If youre a  and you put in tile,1
teacher:Merrill,1
teacher:Christina;student:Each  that you kill gets you 12 hyde how many dodos would you need to take out that armor,1
teacher:Megan,1
teacher:Briella,1
teacher:Measuring;student:We just said measuring,1
teacher:Liam,1
teacher:Ollie;student:You need to know your  for that,1
teacher:Alaina;student:Counting,1
teacher:Ollie,1
teacher:Baking;student:When youre baking,1
teacher:Alaina,1
teacher:Grant,1
teacher:Classity class,1
teacher:Jermaine,1
teacher:Less than,1
teacher:Megan,1
teacher:Harold,1
teacher:Grant,1
teacher:Yep and our value stays the same correct;student:I think it would be equal to because threefourths times three over three is the same as threefourths times one,1
teacher:What did you say,1
teacher:Alaina,1
teacher:Lance,1
teacher:You think its this,1
teacher:This is greater than,1
teacher:Carey,1
teacher:Fivefourths is bigger;student:Threefourths is bigger,1
teacher:Threefourths is bigger;student:Threefourths,1
teacher:Bum bum bum,1
teacher:Call on someone,1
teacher:So you understand it now;student:I forgot to do four times one and three times three,1
teacher:Melvin,1
teacher:Is anyone else noticing a pattern,1
teacher:Nolan,1
teacher:Two and one fourth is about here right,1
teacher:Does that make sense to you,1
teacher:Do you agree that this is two and one fourth,1
teacher:If this is two and this is three right;student:Yes,1
teacher:Is it closer to go to two,1
teacher:Or to three,1
teacher:Did that make sense now,1
teacher:Whos number seven;student:Guys I can do hard things,1
teacher:Okay so you put it a little after two and a half;student:So then to me I thought it would be just one third after two and a half,1
teacher:Frida;student:Aw,1
teacher:Nolan,1
teacher:So raise your hand if you are sharing first,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Abraham;student:For it to pick me,1
teacher:Isnt that closer to a two than it is to three,1
teacher:Twelve is our Piper,1
teacher:Two and one fourth See can I tell you guys something Im noticing,1
teacher:Huhuh Are you doing math right now;student:Did you have a Frida in your class that was LILI,1
teacher:Well go You havent solved the problem;student:No,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Did that help you then,1
teacher:Did you need help with your answer,1
teacher:Were you supposed to,1
teacher:Is there Can I help you with something;student:I didnt know,1
teacher:Frida do you need help,1
teacher:Oh it is you Frankie;student:Thats me,1
teacher:Back to Frankie,1
teacher:So Frankie,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you thought it was addition;student:We thought it was addition,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you knew it was subtraction because you read the problem carefully,1
teacher:So how many of you guys realized the mistake you made,1
teacher:Can I ask you something to be honest,1
teacher:How many of you literally just saw the two numbers and then added them and didnt even totally read,1
teacher:Raise your hand if youre sharing first,1
teacher:Miller,1
teacher:Say that again;student:I agree with Miller,1
teacher:You know what;student:I think we all have to spell it all correctly,1
teacher:So what youre saying is that this is close to a whole,1
teacher:HOld on  you said this is close to a whole,1
teacher:And then you said this is close to a whole;student:Yes,1
teacher:so you said Your estimate if your estimate is right the answer will be close to zero or a little more than zero right,1
teacher:So you said you thought three fourths was closer to a whole right,1
teacher:A half,1
teacher:Tatinana you  alright,1
teacher:Show me on your fingers how many more minutes you need,1
teacher:One third and 30 seconds,1
teacher:Are you solving them,1
teacher:Would you agree,1
teacher:Hannah;student:I did not want to be chosen,1
teacher:Uh huh;student:So the first thing I did is estimate,1
teacher:Is that your estimate or your answer,1
teacher:minusing;student:So all you do is minusing 8,1
teacher:So I started with the three wholes right,1
teacher:was there a max;student:Howd you get 43rds If the max is three thirds,1
teacher:Hannah,1
teacher:Ask me three questions,1
teacher:All right now I would like you to share your answer with your front and back partner;student:crosstalk,1
teacher:Im going to give you 3 minutes well see where were at Okay,1
teacher:if youre finished Madeline,1
teacher:A B A B A B A B Alright Lily Is that a question or a partner o a handraise,1
teacher:And go,1
teacher:Lionel,1
teacher:So what did you say,1
teacher:Was 30 seconds enough time,1
teacher:so they have a common denominator;student:So I think its I think inaudible and I think inaudible Because inaudible so we dont have three and because the denominators on the question are five five And theres the same,1
teacher:Oh so Lily would you say Are you saying that thats something they have similar in both problems are already a common denominator,1
teacher:Kaliah,1
teacher:We know we have an extra 33rds dont we,1
teacher:Because a one whole will be three thirds right,1
teacher:Argo,1
teacher:Does that fall in line with what you guys have to do,1
teacher:ask me three questions right now;student:Yes,1
teacher:Wayne,1
teacher:Are you noticing a pattern;student:I noticed something and like  like when youre dividing it by one half,1
teacher:Hunter,1
teacher:Were estimating,1
teacher:Are you still listening to Lennox,1
teacher:Adrian how are you doing with that,1
teacher:That place hold a zero right;student:Lennox,1
teacher:Gavin;student:Theres not 21,1
teacher:Were you saying 21;student:I didnt say anything,1
teacher:Lonnie,1
teacher:Collete,1
teacher:Because Im not really multiplying by one am I,1
teacher:Camille,1
teacher:Say that again for me;student:So when we were doing it  can we think of this to go up there,1
teacher:Are you asking when youre multiplying does the denominator get bigger;student:Is the  supposed to go up,1
teacher:Is that what youre asking,1
teacher:Have you guys ever heard of an algorithm before,1
teacher:Max youve heard of algorithm;student:Yeah,1
teacher:You just know youve heard of it,1
teacher:Doubting yourself;student:I did 8 x 5 which goes 40 and I did 8 x 6 which equals 47 but I had to add the 4 and I put,1
teacher:Have you heard of it somewhere,1
teacher:Im going to have you share with partners;student:Yup,1
teacher:See what I mean;student:Oh,1
teacher:Grace,1
teacher:Rodney,1
teacher:How are you feeling,1
teacher:Stand up elbow up,1
teacher:Mustafa,1
teacher:Rodney,1
teacher:So keep them all written okay,1
teacher:Done;student:1 2 3 4,1
teacher:Damien,1
teacher:Charlie;student:Ill keep that,1
teacher:Does anyone have a question about that one,1
teacher:Camille,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:I want you to work on this silently and then were going to share our strategies okay;student:Oh so 18,1
teacher:Show me on your fingers how much more time you need;student:Six,1
teacher:Are you ready to share how you get that,1
teacher:Is that clear,1
teacher:You know what;student:No no no,1
teacher:So we talked about that when we did 2 by 2 didnt we,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Celeste;student:Stop,1
teacher:How are you done,1
teacher:What you said is when were estimating we look to see if its closer to three fourths is it closer to one half is it closer to a whole is it closer to a half,1
teacher:Morgan,1
teacher:Remember yesterday we placed B,1
teacher:I mean remember yesterday we put that and put A,1
teacher:MItchell,1
teacher:Does it ask who runs farther;student:Do we have to write who runs farther,1
teacher:I would like you to share with your partner,1
teacher:Raise your hand if youre going first;student:Ive got four,1
teacher:Who just said Wait what;student:I think B goes here because if B goes here its because,1
teacher:Whos number 6,1
teacher:So somewhere around here,1
teacher:Were estimating though right;student:Because with the equation I just did one third plus one and three fourths and I got two and four thirds,1
teacher:Are you with me so far,1
teacher:Are you with me;student:Im hungry,1
teacher:Place holders zero right,1
teacher:Gavin,1
teacher:Celeste,1
teacher:Does anyone have questions about that,1
teacher:Celeste,1
teacher:3 x 0 is 0 right,1
teacher:Does that answer your question,1
teacher:Everybody,1
teacher:Can you,1
teacher:Nolan,1
teacher:Discuss it with your partner,1
teacher:Connor do you have a question,1
teacher:It seems like Did I do something wrong,1
teacher:Okay any questions about that stuff;student:No you did your perfect math and its good,1
teacher:Derek,1
teacher:The 4;student:I dont get How did you get the 4,1
teacher:Can I Can you you want me to tell you,1
teacher:Here;student:I meant the,1
teacher:Camille;student:I totally messed up,1
teacher:You ready back there,1
teacher:Never heard of multiples before;student:No,1
teacher:And now we have the right answer right,1
teacher:Are you sure;student:Yes,1
teacher:We have not spent years learning to count by fours or learning to count by sixes right,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:And I saw you you were writing things down werent you,1
teacher:Especially when we come to something like four times six that were not used to counting by right,1
teacher:Do you see how I counted them out,1
teacher:So Carrie took something she knew right,1
teacher:How are we feeling,1
teacher:Now these are very very similar to what we did but they took away the boxes right,1
teacher:Multiplication is a lot like addition right,1
teacher:Questions,1
teacher:Eleanor,1
teacher:Carrie,1
teacher:Ben,1
teacher:Eleanor you want to try,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Carrie,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Might be easier might be faster but either way thats the same answer right;student:Either way you got the same answer,1
teacher:Is this the length of my shape,1
teacher:And the width of my shape,1
teacher:I want to know how many dots or how many squares are inside the shape right,1
teacher:We can look at this as five groups of seven like Chloe did right,1
teacher:So whichever way you did it you should come up with the same answer right,1
teacher:But that doesnt mean that if you counted by seven that you were wrong right,1
teacher:So I guess really it wouldnt be that long right,1
teacher:So lets try a different one are you ready,1
teacher:Its a two by seven right,1
teacher:You ready,1
teacher:So we could count by two all the way through 10 right,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you counted by twos,1
teacher:Counted by 10s,1
teacher:Is there a right way or a wrong way,1
teacher:Were going to do 10 groups of two are you ready,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Do you;student:I do too,1
teacher:Arogia do you,1
teacher:Diego,1
teacher:Skip counting sometimes we call it right,1
teacher:Are you following me,1
teacher:Right now  Do you have a question James,1
teacher:Okay you just know counting by seven;student:I just knew,1
teacher:Nathan,1
teacher:Did you have to add to get to your sevens,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:You just know how to count by seven,1
teacher:Julia,1
teacher:Is seven a factor of 35,1
teacher:You ready to do one more,1
teacher:Remember nines has that pattern do you remember that nines have that pattern;student:27 36 49 54,1
teacher:All right how do you feel about multiples,1
teacher:Thats what we were doing right,1
teacher:Did it tell you they have to be in order,1
teacher:Four right;student:Four,1
teacher:She is counting by ones right,1
teacher:Where we learned counting by one that was probably the first thing we learned was ones right,1
teacher:Diego,1
teacher:Eleanor,1
teacher:Is two a factor,1
teacher:I guess I gave you a tricky one huh,1
teacher:What about three is three a factor,1
teacher:What about four;student:Yes,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:Four and 14,1
teacher:We might also say length times width will give me the area right,1
teacher:Eleanor,1
teacher:Diego,1
teacher:I could ask you a question and say Hey is two a factor of 56,1
teacher:Okay you got the factors,1
teacher:You ready,1
teacher:I have to ask have you heard it before,1
teacher:Bum bum de bum bum,1
teacher:Chloe,1
teacher:Chloe,1
teacher:Do you understand what they want you to do,1
teacher:Column times rows gives me area right;student:Miss,1
teacher:I need to count the squares or the dot inside my room right,1
teacher:Yeah;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Are we ready,1
teacher:Okay are you sure;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Did you have to count them,1
teacher:Hm did you even have to count by twos;student:No,1
teacher:No thats one of those patterns those dot patterns that were really used to seeing right;student:No,1
teacher:Yeah its on dice right;student:Yeah,1
teacher:When we have four dots on a dice it usually looks like that okay,1
teacher:If I were to measure those sides and if I drew a perfect square those sides would measure the exact same okay,1
teacher:Do we agree,1
teacher:If I connected my dots and I drew perfectly would this also be a square,1
teacher:Would you say if connected that this would also make a square,1
teacher:So when I told you today that we were going to be talking about square numbers I was talking about the arrays that is the same right across as it is bottom right,1
teacher:Are you following me,1
teacher:Multiplication is really looking at groups right;student:The dots are the groups you times your groups,1
teacher:Are you following me,1
teacher:Its just repeated addition right,1
teacher:Where we at,1
teacher:Am I going to get the same answer,1
teacher:Do you remember hearing the word;student:Oh I remember how to do this in,1
teacher:Okay you might have labeled this a three by three right;student:Oh yeah now I remember,1
teacher:Is that starting to look a little bit more familiar;student:And actually what labels are is easy,1
teacher:Have you heard of multiplication before,1
teacher:Okay great raise your hand if youve heard of multiplication before;student:Yes,1
teacher:And youve heard it in Imagine;student:Imagine,1
teacher:Did you hear it last year;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:So now you were still in third grade last year right,1
teacher:What you did here is multiplication right,1
teacher:Counted;student:Then add it,1
teacher:And then tell me what youre doing okay;student:Yay,1
teacher:Alan,1
teacher:Owen;student:Five,1
teacher:When youre thinking about multiplication youre thinking about groups of things right,1
teacher:If we look at this array this five by five array this is the same as saying five plus five plus five plus five plus five right,1
teacher:Youve been counting by five probably since you were five years old right,1
teacher:Its like us adding a group plus a group plus a group plus a group right;student:Yeah,1
teacher:We did counting where you guys used the strategy of counting by fives right,1
teacher:Twos;student:I can count by twos,1
teacher:So we definitely looked at a three by three array right,1
teacher:A product right,1
teacher:When we started going into our math journal yesterday they gave you a big grid of dots do you remember that,1
teacher:And we counted right,1
teacher:Can you still make that connection of how many dots are inside there,1
teacher:We still have an array we just took part of it away right;student:Nine,1
teacher:Are you following me,1
teacher:Well yeah but you should be writing  paper right;student:can we still write that on our paper,1
teacher:This is a five by five right,1
teacher:Do you agree,1
teacher:But I would dots right,1
teacher:Well we could count the tiny little boxes in there right,1
teacher:Five right;student:Five,1
teacher:Did I have to count dots,1
teacher:Did I have to count boxes;student:No,1
teacher:So yesterday we were talking area model right,1
teacher:A factor right;student:A factor,1
teacher:And so when we multiply them together we get a square number right,1
teacher:Carrie,1
teacher:Can you guys count by two,1
teacher:Thats something weve been practicing for a while right;student:four six eight 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24,1
teacher:Owen,1
teacher:What;student:We can do six,1
teacher:Tens can you count by tens,1
teacher:So thats skip counting do you remember them calling it skip counting;student:10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100,1
teacher:You guys used skip counting when you were thinking of the threes right,1
teacher:In order to find the area the inside we know were going to take the columns by the rows right,1
teacher:Those are kind of the ones that we focus on right,1
teacher:So if I said lets say lets count by fours if we were looking at a four by four array and we needed to figure out how many were in there we could count by fours right,1
teacher:You ready to try some work on your own,1
teacher:Factors are the two numbers that youre going to multiply together to get this answer okay,1
teacher:So that very next one is going to be five by five right,1
teacher:So what they want is for you to box them up right,1
teacher:Wyatt are you hearing me,1
teacher:Owen,1
teacher:We could skip count by sevens if we wanted to right,1
teacher:Do you remember these,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Is the computer always right;student:Miss did you notice that always the computer gets to the right number,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:Some of it part of right;student:Like some of it,1
teacher:So if I give you this 35 times 62 could you find an answer to this,1
teacher:Do you have the tools now to find an answer to this;student:Yes,1
teacher:We can use partial products or what we called it on Tuesday multiplication wrestling right,1
teacher:Okay were going to separate these two right;student:Separate the 30 from the five and put 30,1
teacher:I have two digits here which means I have two players okay,1
teacher:Ricardo youll catch on quick I promise okay,1
teacher:Nathan,1
teacher:Do you remember that part,1
teacher:Nathan do you think you know,1
teacher:Yeah;student:I think that its you said they was wrestling it would wrestle the 30 maybe might wrestle the 60,1
teacher:I could count them out right,1
teacher:Do you remember that little piece now,1
teacher:Jacob,1
teacher:The answer to our multiplication problem right;student:The answer,1
teacher:Louise,1
teacher:Were multiplying okay;student:Multiplying,1
teacher:How are we feeling,1
teacher:Then we got to go to our other player which is the three right,1
teacher:How are we feeling,1
teacher:You ready;student:Good,1
teacher:Solve this out,1
teacher:Do you see why its important that we know those basic facts,1
teacher:Questions,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:Its not too bad,1
teacher:Do you see that,1
teacher:You following me,1
teacher:Are you following me,1
teacher:Now my one has to wrestle everybody right,1
teacher:You with me,1
teacher:Did anybody get an answer,1
teacher:4823;student:4723  4 823,1
teacher:We okay to play this game for a little bit,1
teacher:Okay so youre going to come up and multiply;student:We can add three times six and then when you get the answer to three times six you add two zero because,1
teacher:The five right;student:The fives,1
teacher:All done,1
teacher:Were able to go all the way through by themselves,1
teacher:Okay now if you werent able to get all the way through by yourselves is it because you forgot what you were doing or you ran out of time,1
teacher:Ran out of time;student:Ran out of time,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Do you want a tough one,1
teacher:Yeah;student:Yes please,1
teacher:Something tricky,1
teacher:Am I right,1
teacher:If you knew your basic facts this would be real easy right,1
teacher:Do we know our combinations,1
teacher:Got it but you see your mistake now right,1
teacher:But what I noticed is that everybody figures that part out okay,1
teacher:How many can get through this part by themselves;student:six times nine,1
teacher:This next part is where it gets tricky right,1
teacher:32,1
teacher:How many had it;student:Yes,1
teacher:All right are you ready,1
teacher:20 and seven never wrestle because theyre on the same team right;student:Hey Miss Im seeing that only 20 and seven are wrestling,1
teacher:Everybody caught up;student:Seven times five,1
teacher:And then were going to add a zero right,1
teacher:What;student:at the end of 60,1
teacher:Am I good;student:Sorry,1
teacher:Okay are we ready,1
teacher:Did we find the answer to a multiplication problem;student:I got it right,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:You ready,1
teacher:Chloe,1
teacher:Penelope,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you remembered that step,1
teacher:Chloe,1
teacher:Two times nine;student:Two times nine,1
teacher:Are you sure,1
teacher:Lets do all of our combinations before we do our multiplication okay,1
teacher:Jacob,1
teacher:Give me a thumbs up if you got this far;student:90 and five,1
teacher:So Im sure I want to go big right,1
teacher:Okay ready,1
teacher:You sure,1
teacher:Do we really know what Daren read,1
teacher:Could I put those number sentences together,1
teacher:Talk to the person behind you or sorry front roads,1
teacher:Okay go ahead,1
teacher:Talk about it,1
teacher:Now could we figure out how much Daren read,1
teacher:Sam,1
teacher:So if we look right here we knew that Julia read 8 books right,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:We have three to fly to well say Alberta right,1
teacher:Do you see how you did that,1
teacher:Could we combine them again,1
teacher:Raise your hand,1
teacher:Do you think you understand how to pull this number sentence out of a number story,1
teacher:Whats somebody read question number two for me,1
teacher:So right now I just put Deren with a D and Julie with a J show me your thumbs,1
teacher:Chloe will tell you when you read it please,1
teacher:Are you ready during the summer,1
teacher:And Im going to turn them in to an equation right,1
teacher:Everybody know what theyre doing,1
teacher:We need to take it apart right,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you have an answer for this,1
teacher:You added nine plus eight and have 17;student:I just added 9 plus 8 and got 17,1
teacher:Eight more tells you that you need to add right,1
teacher:Thats what Linda sold right,1
teacher:Not a lot of thinking right;student:Easy,1
teacher:Pretty basic addition on the first story would you agree,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you identified that one word,1
teacher:Victoria did you find that key word,1
teacher:Do you see the only big difference,1
teacher:When were reading something right,1
teacher:If we were reading this we would say nine times eight right,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:So these are sentences right,1
teacher:So this one a little bit different because we know how big everybodys line is right,1
teacher:Do we know what the D is,1
teacher:Do we know how many times the line is,1
teacher:Following me,1
teacher:With me so far,1
teacher:Do you see where I got that,1
teacher:You with me,1
teacher:Do you see where I got those,1
teacher:Are you sure,1
teacher:Remember that was one of those tricky ones right,1
teacher:16 no zeros right;student:Is 16,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Piece of cake right,1
teacher:Pretty cool huh,1
teacher:You ready to try it with me,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:You with me,1
teacher:You with me,1
teacher:Are you with me,1
teacher:Rynn,1
teacher:Do you see how I got those,1
teacher:50,1
teacher:So thats going to say do we know how Shares line is;student:No,1
teacher:You can write it in your journal right,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:All right are you ready for your assignments,1
teacher:So you think you can handle this,1
teacher:Questions,1
teacher:Miguel,1
teacher:Ben you with me,1
teacher:Chloe,1
teacher:Nathan,1
teacher:Could you solve it,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:You ready for another one,1
teacher:Do we remember this stuff;student:Two,1
teacher:Nicole;student:My brother goes to Northland High School,1
teacher:Are we ready;student:My brother my brother goes to Northland also,1
teacher:Do you remember this,1
teacher:Yeah because one plus four is 512 right;student:What I added to 112 was 412,1
teacher:Its just a microphone thatll pick up because were recording okay,1
teacher:And youre going to do page 15 which is math boxes right,1
teacher:Aiden,1
teacher:Lucy,1
teacher:Weve just proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the only numbers of lockers that will be opened are the ones that have an odd number of factors right,1
teacher:Because if it only has two its still a prime number still has an even number of factors right,1
teacher:Mia,1
teacher:Huh;student:Shapes,1
teacher:Rory,1
teacher:Rory,1
teacher:Raising your hand,1
teacher:James;student:Dots,1
teacher:Aiden,1
teacher:Weve used it under the term decimal point right,1
teacher:Our wholes from our parts right,1
teacher:Emerson,1
teacher:You cant have anything without a starting point right,1
teacher:Leah,1
teacher:So when you draw a line segment on your paper do you put a starting point and a stopping point,1
teacher:Camila,1
teacher:49 right;student:49,1
teacher:Is that going to be a pain in the butt to figure out,1
teacher:Is it going to be our best way to solve,1
teacher:Victoria,1
teacher:You ready for the light bulbs in your brains to go off,1
teacher:Anthony,1
teacher:Thats it right;student:One and three,1
teacher:Four factors right,1
teacher:Thats it right;student:1 and 13,1
teacher:Twelves closed right;student:12,1
teacher:Leah,1
teacher:One and 12 right,1
teacher:So theres a bunch of them right,1
teacher:Huh,1
teacher:Easy,1
teacher:Six times itself right;student:Six times six,1
teacher:10 times 10 right,1
teacher:No you just start here and go to here right,1
teacher:But does it have a starting point and a stopping point,1
teacher:For our line segments we put points on the ends for our starting and our stopping point but does a line have points,1
teacher:You only see one of everything;student:Yeah,1
teacher:If we took this gentleman and flipped him on the line if hes two dimensional which he is would everything be perfectly lined up,1
teacher:But if they were drawn perfectly,1
teacher:Would they all line up,1
teacher:Do we have a mirror image on each side,1
teacher:Has anybody looked at the numbers yet,1
teacher:Done any type of I dont know research or acquiring of knowledge of the different numbers of the different sizes,1
teacher:Go ahead say it;student:Four,1
teacher:We got four quarts right,1
teacher:Four quarts okay;student:Four quarts,1
teacher:Ricky what about you,1
teacher:Eight pints;student:Eight,1
teacher:Alex,1
teacher:Like that;student:I notice that 4 times 2 is equal 8 and 8 times 2 is 16,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:Do you see one of everything up there,1
teacher:Anthony what about you,1
teacher:Do you see just one of everything up here,1
teacher:See just one right;student:One,1
teacher:Rory,1
teacher:Now can they have more than two points on them,1
teacher:But does it stop it either one of my points,1
teacher:Does my line stop at either one of my points,1
teacher:We wouldnt say it that way would we,1
teacher:Aria,1
teacher:Because our line is simply passing through that particular point right,1
teacher:Jordans pattern might work right,1
teacher:Can I have more,1
teacher:Diego,1
teacher:Because guess what,1
teacher:Can you make a triangle without line segments,1
teacher:So I still had to use one of those things on the board right,1
teacher:Can you do it without using lines and line segments or rays,1
teacher:Three right,1
teacher:Gallon right;student:Gallon,1
teacher:I wrote an A and a B right;student:Wrote A and B,1
teacher:Pint;student:I see a pattern that its going quart and,1
teacher:Because it should be eight is the next one right,1
teacher:Will this change,1
teacher:Always,1
teacher:Okay is 23 half of 46,1
teacher:So is that equal to onehalf;student:Yes,1
teacher:Keep going Keegan,1
teacher:Kase are you ready,1
teacher:This is supposed to be two right,1
teacher:Okay so when you do this what do you get,1
teacher:Alright Ethan lets start with you,1
teacher:All right go ahead man,1
teacher:Can you hold them higher;student:This person every single one of these,1
teacher:A little louder,1
teacher:You sure about that one;student:So every other locker  and she would agree to every third,1
teacher:So your answer wouldnt be 200 it would be 300,1
teacher:Half of that,1
teacher:Rileys was eight yours is 10 right,1
teacher:If our numerator is half of our denominator is the fraction always going to be equal to onehalf,1
teacher:Miss Emerson come on up,1
teacher:Joella,1
teacher:Right Helena;student:One,1
teacher:Did you still have a question Johnny,1
teacher:Elyse,1
teacher:Yeah only one time did we have to divide right;student:There was less steps,1
teacher:Johnny,1
teacher:We just had two right,1
teacher:The whole idea is when you figure something cool out in math Thats why I give you those riddles every morning because those of you that have figured them out doesnt it feel cool when you figure out the actual answer for a challenging math problem,1
teacher:Thats the only way itll work huh,1
teacher:Huh,1
teacher:Whos going to get the fancy pen,1
teacher:Whos going to get the fancy pen,1
teacher:Two people in the room,1
teacher:Okay Miss Keegan is going to take us home,1
teacher:Leon,1
teacher:Helena,1
teacher:Remember for unit three,1
teacher:Hmm;student:Now my pen color is black,1
teacher:Now as I told you a problem like this is it realistic to draw 1000 lockers,1
teacher:And then mark 1000 people,1
teacher:But you when youre doing your samples do you need to put more people than there are lockers,1
teacher:Huh;student:The fifth locker,1
teacher:1 is a factor two is a factor four is a factor five is a factor,1
teacher:Rory,1
teacher:Charlie,1
teacher:Diego,1
teacher:Emerson,1
teacher:Four right;student:Four,1
teacher:Has person number 4 already gone through,1
teacher:Is anybody else in the line going to touch number four,1
teacher:It should be touched six times by the time were done right,1
teacher:Do they touch any others,1
teacher:No because the next multiple would be 21 right;student:No,1
teacher:Is 8 done,1
teacher:Is nine done,1
teacher:And is it open;student:Yes,1
teacher:Can 4,1
teacher:Can 3;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Can two go into 8,1
teacher:Can one go into eight,1
teacher:What;student:You can just repeat the first person,1
teacher:Rory,1
teacher:Riley,1
teacher:Its not going to touch any of these right,1
teacher:So you dont have to worry about any people after the 20th person for this sample only because they wont touch any of these will they,1
teacher:Open right;student:Open,1
teacher:Lucy,1
teacher:So we would have to keep going to extend that to see if it works right,1
teacher:Theyre what;student:Every third,1
teacher:Rory,1
teacher:Multiples right;student:Multiples,1
teacher:Three so our third person so what were essentially doing in this problem is multiples right;student:Three,1
teacher:Going to what;student:Open every fourth locker,1
teacher:Open or close every fourth locker right;student:Open every fourth locker,1
teacher:It is the only locker of these 20 lockers that has been touched by every single person,1
teacher:Are any of those numbers other of the 12,1
teacher:Emerson,1
teacher:Do we have any questions before you started,1
teacher:So it branches out okay,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yep,1
teacher:If I asked this and this and this I can see how many stairs hes already set to climb right;student:And we can see how much he needs,1
teacher:Whats the issue over here,1
teacher:Did you add it all up,1
teacher:Did you add,1
teacher:What are you waiting for,1
teacher:Did anybody match with me,1
teacher:Nobody got 340 when they added them on up,1
teacher:So you want to know what can I add to 340 to make 400;student:You have to add a number that makes 400,1
teacher:So our plan is to look at those number stories and decide do we need to add do we need to subtract,1
teacher:Do we maybe need to do a little bit of both,1
teacher:And if you look at that first problem right there on page 13 thats the one I just gave you about Terrell and hes a competitive stair climber right,1
teacher:Is there somebody that wants to read that one out loud to us,1
teacher:Chloe you want to read it,1
teacher:Oh so were back to Terrell and he climbed four different buildings right;student:How many stories did he climb in all,1
teacher:The Willis Tower right,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:When Im looking at word problems like this I like to circle in there the information thats important right,1
teacher:You want to go through any of those problems,1
teacher:Margo did you get a chance to get that done,1
teacher:So somehow they gained 150 here okay,1
teacher:What was that,1
teacher:Paycheck right;student:Paycheck,1
teacher:River,1
teacher:So when I say going back to this point six negative 50 this point the absolute value  of negative 60 which really is the distance from zero right,1
teacher:Everybody at home do you have these notes down,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:1100 AM right,1
teacher:11  00 AM 10  00 AM 900 AM right,1
teacher:So  that opposite operation is  14 negative and  did you get  to an answer,1
teacher:Yeah;student:Oh yeah,1
teacher:The next thing about dividing by two is youre really just taking something in half right;student:And I got 32,1
teacher:Hows everyone at home,1
teacher:Did you get all that down,1
teacher:You got all of it down,1
teacher:Youre good River,1
teacher:The American Tower;student:American Tower,1
teacher:Okay but what is it Read me the actual question;student:To add,1
teacher:What does it say,1
teacher:Did you do this,1
teacher:Did you do the math,1
teacher:So are we done,1
teacher:Is this our answer,1
teacher:Chloe,1
teacher:Im going to take three buildings plus all the buildings;student:384 plus 472 maybe,1
teacher:Do you see how that works,1
teacher:Do I have to do some training,1
teacher:Can I do two minus four,1
teacher:Can I do 12 minus four;student:No,1
teacher:Can I do six minus eight;student:Eight,1
teacher:Can I do 16 minus eight;student:No,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:Yeah check my work right,1
teacher:Questions,1
teacher:Have you started this yet,1
teacher:Do we know how to tall building number three;student:Yes,1
teacher:Do we know how tall building number two,1
teacher:Do we know how tall building number one is,1
teacher:Alison what is the actual question say,1
teacher:Do you see that;student:How many stories did he climb in all,1
teacher:Lets put them all together right,1
teacher:Easy enough right,1
teacher:My 10 should all be underneath each other right,1
teacher:What does number three say,1
teacher:Nathan what does it say,1
teacher:Thats like two bags of groceries right,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Do we have more than one step,1
teacher:You want to add;student:Add,1
teacher:The question says what Miguel,1
teacher:What does the question say,1
teacher:Thats what we want our answer to be right,1
teacher:Julia,1
teacher:Im going to add up 472 plus 163 plus 120 plus 101,1
teacher:Did they tell us how tall the last building was,1
teacher:Youre going to see can you convert this stuff,1
teacher:I needed groceries right,1
teacher:Six negative 50 is going to be 32500 right,1
teacher:Is that a six I hope,1
teacher:Eight cups in a gallon,1
teacher:Any questions about that first page,1
teacher:Huh,1
teacher:You have no concept of fractions after the last month and a half of me teaching them,1
teacher:Seriously,1
teacher:You guys have never seen anything with a line in the middle,1
teacher:Id have a fraction right,1
teacher:The only problem is I dont have any numbers yet right,1
teacher:But do I have a numerator and a denominator,1
teacher:Hello,1
teacher:Are those the same thing,1
teacher:What I have written on the board are those the same thing,1
teacher:Are equivalent fractions the same thing,1
teacher:Are those the same thing,1
teacher:Whats nine times two,1
teacher:Are those the same thing,1
teacher:So were multiplying by two right,1
teacher:Does this remind you guys of InNOut boxes,1
teacher:So on our little guy the quart is the arm right,1
teacher:And then the wrist theres two of them in the wrist right,1
teacher:Okay so you used this guy;student:Well the first pint I drew,1
teacher:Remember,1
teacher:Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top,1
teacher:It doubles right;student:Four,1
teacher:Huh;student:Six,1
teacher:Six;student:Six,1
teacher:You multiplied three times two;student:Three times two,1
teacher:And that gave you six;student:Three times two,1
teacher:So can we use multiplication Jackson to get this one,1
teacher:But yes what are we really using here to solve this one,1
teacher:Division right;student:Division,1
teacher:And is it still going to be the same thing,1
teacher:Is it still going to be two,1
teacher:Its pretty much an InNOut box right,1
teacher:Jose say that louder;student:The same amounts,1
teacher:So theyre equivalent right,1
teacher:But are they the same exact thing,1
teacher:So this is where we start using graphing for realworld purposes right,1
teacher:And we had spoken about where do we see negative numbers right,1
teacher:So B is right here okay,1
teacher:We could even say account balance and its in dollars okay,1
teacher:Were looking at the amount of money someone has over days right,1
teacher:And its always saying estimate right,1
teacher:So yeah Franclin,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:S;student:S,1
teacher:Just let people think about it for a minute okay,1
teacher:This seems really straight forward but theres actually some really important conversations like Ryder and Franclin that I want to clarify of the answers you gave me okay,1
teacher:Because theyre not quite fully to whats really happening in it okay,1
teacher:A lot more right;student:A lot,1
teacher:There on the sixth day they owe the bank We dont know anything about their spending habits if they just had one down right,1
teacher:So thats really all that point tells us but if youre thinking about  the spending you need to go to the day before and it was 275 so like Franclin said then the chRiver right,1
teacher:And we dont always think of 02 as being plottable because its kind of in the middle of a square but all you really need to think is its just above the line right,1
teacher:All right B who wants to Franclin come on up,1
teacher:Yes;student:Ms Reeves,1
teacher:So everybody at home here the points you want to label them with a letter and in ordered pair  okay,1
teacher:Are these the same,1
teacher:But are they going to give you the same amount;student:No,1
teacher:One quart right;student:A quart,1
teacher:Sophia,1
teacher:The small and the large right;student:The small one,1
teacher:Because thats what it says right,1
teacher:The denominator right;student:Oh wait,1
teacher:And if youll remember that absolute value that we had talked about this is kind of getting back to distances right,1
teacher:Is it random how much its getting bigger,1
teacher:That equals one pint right;student:That the quart if you split it in half it goes into pint,1
teacher:It takes four right,1
teacher:Now that represents my whole correct,1
teacher:Asher,1
teacher:Yeah;student:Miss,1
teacher:are you ready,1
teacher:Just do it on your own this is just practice and then we can share what we find okay,1
teacher:So this is the opposite of what we were doing earlier right,1
teacher:Mmhmm;student:T,1
teacher:Ariana,1
teacher:Give me a thumbs up when you are ready,1
teacher:You with us Alec,1
teacher:So you have five chances to find a treasure Okay any questions,1
teacher:Questions,1
teacher:Jacob,1
teacher:Clay,1
teacher:You all good;student:Theres Already a one there,1
teacher:Yeah;student:But its the same denominator,1
teacher:You need to do the dance,1
teacher:so five one which you already plotted Right,1
teacher:Got it,1
teacher:You good,1
teacher:Did you finish,1
teacher:Are you done,1
teacher:That doesnt look right does it,1
teacher:Mariah,1
teacher:Could your friend be at the gas station,1
teacher:And one times two would be two right,1
teacher:Do you want to do one more,1
teacher:Landon,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:You did a different problem;student:I did a different problem,1
teacher:Okay well you did a different route,1
teacher:And you got 10 right,1
teacher:Okay so so no matter what youre gonna have to go two vertically and eight horizontally right,1
teacher:Mia,1
teacher:Okay stand up when youre done,1
teacher:So Landon;student:Start with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10,1
teacher:Caleb,1
teacher:Michaela,1
teacher:Okay so you were at the post office;student:The pizzeria,1
teacher:Is that what they said,1
teacher:Joey,1
teacher:Brielle,1
teacher:Sorry;student:The ice cream shop,1
teacher:You have another one,1
teacher:So if you double zero you still get zero right,1
teacher:Greater;student:I think its going to be bigger,1
teacher:Take off if you agree with him,1
teacher:Were looking for patterns right Mike,1
teacher:Gunner will you read that for us please,1
teacher:Everybody say extrapolate,1
teacher:So what do you think,1
teacher:Do Sarahs ordered pairs model the data,1
teacher:Overall was he correct;student:And then seven point eleven its eleven point seven and then the rest is right,1
teacher:What do you guys think,1
teacher:Did she do it correctly,1
teacher:You do think she did it correctly,1
teacher:I wonder how you dont think she did it correctly right,1
teacher:So what do you think,1
teacher:Did Sarah do it correctly,1
teacher:Ally,1
teacher:Are these correct,1
teacher:So Abigailla did she write them correctly,1
teacher:Help me read that please,1
teacher:Anybody else,1
teacher:Sierra,1
teacher:Anybody else,1
teacher:Does that look right to you,1
teacher:tell your person was it right,1
teacher:Are you confused as well,1
teacher:Alright for those of you who are ready for it on the third one on the third ones for new sailboat two it says The rule is to do what,1
teacher:Aden can you read it really loudly,1
teacher:Okay twice as long;student:I think its is going to be as tall as the original sailboat but longer,1
teacher:so twice as tall,1
teacher:Stand up when you think you know,1
teacher:Got it,1
teacher:The answer should have been two and two fifths Logan,1
teacher:You guys ready,1
teacher:Showdown,1
teacher:Seven and three halves,1
teacher:Does that work,1
teacher:Anybody else,1
teacher:Im sorry,1
teacher:So are you guys talking about what your answer should be,1
teacher:Caleb,1
teacher:We proved it right,1
teacher:Landon,1
teacher:Isaac,1
teacher:Four;student:Four,1
teacher:You did what;student:I did like the same thing Joey did,1
teacher:The same way Joey did;student:I did like the same thing Joey did,1
teacher:So you used the relationship between the multiplication and division,1
teacher:Huh;student:That one was a little bit more tricky so you could use multiplication table,1
teacher:Can you what;student:Can I come up,1
teacher:Okay so you took 13 divided by three;student:I did 13 divided by three to get nine,1
teacher:Did anybody draw a picture,1
teacher:Do you have a picture to show,1
teacher:So you were counting up,1
teacher:Cooper,1
teacher:Did you make the circles first,1
teacher:Or did you just count,1
teacher:Were you thinking 14 or something;student:Oh yeah,1
teacher:Joey,1
teacher:Logan do you want to come up and bring your pen,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:You doing okay,1
teacher:Are we done,1
teacher:Is there one more,1
teacher:Does that makes sense you guys,1
teacher:So this times this has to equal this right,1
teacher:Are you guys listening today,1
teacher:Joey will you read it for us,1
teacher:Avery,1
teacher:Cooper,1
teacher:Avery,1
teacher:Evenly right;student:That you cant divide it,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:Cooper,1
teacher:Were dividing them into two parts right,1
teacher:Okay so 4 twos would be half;student:And then thats four of these,1
teacher:But lets put that big one right down the middle that right,1
teacher:Colin,1
teacher:Threes;student:And then I grouped them in fours,1
teacher:So this would be right,1
teacher:You had 10 blocks;student:I had 10 blocks,1
teacher:So you think you can do it in 10,1
teacher:What;student:The origin,1
teacher:Alec,1
teacher:Can we agree that its 11 blocks,1
teacher:Is it 11;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Anything other than 11,1
teacher:Oh yeah you can take a longer route but something less than 11,1
teacher:Okay Anna,1
teacher:Mikey,1
teacher:Isaac,1
teacher:6 5;student:He says 6 5,1
teacher:Okay so no matter what you guys look at the relationship do you see anything interesting,1
teacher:Aiden,1
teacher:Joey,1
teacher:Who did nine who had less than Logan,1
teacher:You guys have fewer than 10 like nine blocks,1
teacher:So fewer than 10,1
teacher:I asked it wrong right,1
teacher:Does that make sense to you guys that we split those last two granola bars in thirds and then pass those thirds out,1
teacher:So you could break those into thirds right,1
teacher:Does that make sense to you,1
teacher:Okay so a fourth of three would be we could have three right,1
teacher:So I would draw a stick and so there are four wholes right,1
teacher:And I think were disrupting I will know Im successful when Chase will you read that part,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:Does that make sense to you guys,1
teacher:Will you read the instructions please,1
teacher:So if we are if were looking at this if you can imagine this as Silvercreek and if we pretend that these are all city blocks you cant just walk through you cant walk diagonally through a block can you,1
teacher:If youre actually in a city does it mattter,1
teacher:Does it matter which way,1
teacher:Fifty,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:You do,1
teacher:If youre in a city does it matter which way you go,1
teacher:So you know that Ben is walking from school to the grocery store right,1
teacher:You drew a picture;student:I drew a picture,1
teacher:Fletcher,1
teacher:Well she wasnt consistent right,1
teacher:Because they what;student:Because theyre not the same,1
teacher:Joey,1
teacher:So your success criteria today Landon is,1
teacher:Three and five eighths  is what we said right,1
teacher:Isaac,1
teacher:Landon,1
teacher:So on problem three can you do that one mentally,1
teacher:Can you do number four mentally,1
teacher:Cooper,1
teacher:Can you still do an estimate for number four,1
teacher:Pretty easily,1
teacher:Can you solve number five mentally,1
teacher:Can anybody get us started,1
teacher:Anna can you get us started over here,1
teacher:Can you subtract these as they are;student:I would probably take a whole from,1
teacher:If we were adding these two numbers everybody look up here can we add those really easily,1
teacher:Say that again,1
teacher:And this would be a fraction right;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:Talk to your neighbor,1
teacher:Oh Ethan,1
teacher:So he wants to put a picture of a larger book on his folder okay,1
teacher:So you get to decide in what way or ways its going to be larger okay,1
teacher:Questions,1
teacher:Okay everybody ready,1
teacher:Does anybody want to read that to me,1
teacher:You dont need to use the partial product or partial sums,1
teacher:Are you guys set,1
teacher:Are you confident,1
teacher:Caleb,1
teacher:Natalie,1
teacher:Eli,1
teacher:And so when I add something to it I need to add ones plus ones right,1
teacher:So when we are adding we always add place value the same place values together right,1
teacher:Okay so our  for today is  will you read that for us please,1
teacher:So this would be a mixed number right,1
teacher:Four thirds,1
teacher:Then youd subtract a half from that,1
teacher:Can you subtract four thirds from a half,1
teacher:Maddie,1
teacher:Bryson,1
teacher:So you divided the invite;student:So I thought of it more as a division problem,1
teacher:Can you get the answer often,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:Bridger,1
teacher:Do you guys see that,1
teacher:So one fifth in order for the denominator to be five you need to have five equal parts right,1
teacher:Zach,1
teacher:Youre finding you have to first find one right,1
teacher:No it will be three times three right;student:Total three,1
teacher:Talk to your partner,1
teacher:So so in the first one youre just finding threefifths of a number right,1
teacher:Yesterday our strategy for finding three fifths was to first find one fifth and then multiply it by three right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Stand up when youre done;student:I dont even look at the one,1
teacher:One fifth is times its the same as times 15 right,1
teacher:You guys we did one one fifth of whole numbers yesterday right;student:Oh okay,1
teacher:A fifth of that,1
teacher:You can,1
teacher:Everybody get that,1
teacher:Do you need some help,1
teacher:The three,1
teacher:The one by two to get two;student:You multiply the one by,1
teacher:So now we know that one third is equal to two sixths right,1
teacher:We also have to We have to convert the one half into sixths right,1
teacher:Questions,1
teacher:So thats equivalent right,1
teacher:Are we good,1
teacher:So can we subtract it now,1
teacher:Eric,1
teacher:Do you guys see how I do that,1
teacher:Are you good,1
teacher:Any questions about that,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Its the same amount,1
teacher:Did Sarah write these ordered pairs right,1
teacher:Abigail,1
teacher:Are you listening,1
teacher:Is the value of this expression less than 798 plus 212,1
teacher:How about this one,1
teacher:Okay and how about this one,1
teacher:Chris,1
teacher:Is the value of the expression exactly half of 5937 times 31,1
teacher:Is this one going to be exactly half of that,1
teacher:Drew,1
teacher:Would anybody like some clarification about what a rule is;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Remember this on the sailboats,1
teacher:When you change the sailboats,1
teacher:No here you doubled the first one right,1
teacher:Im sorry what;student:Got to do the next page,1
teacher:So this is the triangle right,1
teacher:So they have bisected that triangle to make a right triangle do you see that;student:Yeah,1
teacher:So do you have a question for me or are you good,1
teacher:So is the value of this expression less than 798 plus 212,1
teacher:Are you done;student:Im good,1
teacher:Fletcher,1
teacher:All right how about this one,1
teacher:It mightve been okay if she flipped them all but she should report them all the same way right as ordered pairs,1
teacher:Do you understand what you need to do,1
teacher:We just talked about how she did it wrong and you noticed that she did this one wrong too right,1
teacher:Graph them,1
teacher:Avery,1
teacher:More ages;student:Lilith has more ages,1
teacher:Will she always be older by four years,1
teacher:So here weve got Lilith is five and a half so Noah is one and a half right,1
teacher:Any questions about the instructions on the second page on 139,1
teacher:Is the value of this expression greater than 45 times nine,1
teacher:Yes or no,1
teacher:Did you solve it,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:Abigail,1
teacher:Because 45 times nine is in both of them right;student:It wouldnt be greater than 45 times nine,1
teacher:Is this one greater than 45 times nine,1
teacher:Okay are you done,1
teacher:Oh you did,1
teacher:Were you specific;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Savannah,1
teacher:Zero and zero because if you multiply zero times two you still get zero okay;student:Zero and zero,1
teacher:Talk to your shoulder partner,1
teacher:Double if I multiplied it by three;student:By double,1
teacher:Elijah,1
teacher:Way longer;student:We thought it would be way longer because it,1
teacher:It would be way wider if we changed the second coordinate;student:Wider,1
teacher:Ari,1
teacher:It would be three times or it would be three times the height okay,1
teacher:No idea,1
teacher:Fletcher,1
teacher:Abigail,1
teacher:Abigail,1
teacher:You put it in a table;student:Yeah,1
teacher:So you applied the rule to the coordinates you made a table of the coordinates and according to what the rule was you made a prediction of what it would look like and then you drew it to find out what it truly did look like after she applied the rule right,1
teacher:So if we double the first coordinate it would be zero times two is still zero right,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Landon,1
teacher:Josh,1
teacher:Five;student:Five you said its going to be wider than five because theyre doubling it,1
teacher:Double the first coordinate okay,1
teacher:Are you guys ready,1
teacher:Josh,1
teacher:So something you do to a number maybe;student:Its what you would do like I remember doing the rule books in like second grade its telling you what to do like times two or times four,1
teacher:So the very first one was I dont know you might have two as the X and three as the Y thats how it works right,1
teacher:So the width of a quadrilateral and this is the height okay,1
teacher:So youre going to write a rule and then youre going to describe what the new picture will look like okay,1
teacher:Are we clear about that,1
teacher:Drew,1
teacher:So you said longer;student:Well I thought because if you double the coordinates then I thought maybe it could be longer,1
teacher:Abigail,1
teacher:Julian,1
teacher:Landon,1
teacher:So two times wider okay;student:Wider by two times,1
teacher:Did you have questions,1
teacher:The length you would have to tell me what youre referring to for the length because length can be anything okay,1
teacher:Do you remember that,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:So I see lots of number models because it was pretty easy to understand right,1
teacher:Five thirds;student:Five thirds,1
teacher:And everybody say composing,1
teacher:Composing,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Isaac will you read that please,1
teacher:Okay so three halves is going to be this would be the same as two halves right,1
teacher:And its bigger than that,1
teacher:You with me,1
teacher:Okay it is Alec;student:Three and two,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Numerator divided by denominator right,1
teacher:17 divided by three right;student:That is um,1
teacher:Do you think its important to know your your multiplication facts,1
teacher:Multiplication;student:Multiplication,1
teacher:Do any of you guys know how to do this kind of problem,1
teacher:Talk to your neighbors,1
teacher:Doing it once doesnt mean youve got it right,1
teacher:You need to talk why dont you come around and talk to me for a second,1
teacher:Talk to your friends,1
teacher:Did you guys talk about it;student:Because 1213ths is almost a whole,1
teacher:To two,1
teacher:Is it closer to one,1
teacher:Or is it closer to two,1
teacher:You think its closer to two;student:Its closer to two,1
teacher:You had to estimate right,1
teacher:Okay go,1
teacher:Are you guys working together;student:That would be three,1
teacher:Brody,1
teacher:Say it again;student:Because minusing a half from that it wouldnt be a half again,1
teacher:So youre saying youre supposed to have this is what were taking away,1
teacher:Aiden,1
teacher:So this is just a little bit less than a half right,1
teacher:So I want you to if that is confusing,1
teacher:Caleb will you read our learning intention please;student:Okay what I thought was about the future,1
teacher:Talk to your shoulder person,1
teacher:Anybody draw a picture,1
teacher:So and then the best way to prove it is to show it right,1
teacher:Not,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:That makes sense,1
teacher:So this is your edreports three what did I say,1
teacher:So does that make it easier;student:Thats a lot,1
teacher:Three wholes right,1
teacher:So this would be okay so and then were talking about these two and then three wholes right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Yeah cause theyre thirds right;student:We watch this for the example,1
teacher:Jeff,1
teacher:Talk to your neighbor,1
teacher:Ilea,1
teacher:Are you thinking about like division with a with a hammer,1
teacher:Aiden,1
teacher:Did anybody,1
teacher:So you guys are talking,1
teacher:Caleb,1
teacher:Im sorry what,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:So you showed me 21 fifths is the same as 21 divided by five right,1
teacher:So if you think about it as a division problem you all know that 21 divided by five five goes into 21 four times right,1
teacher:Anybody else,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:12345 and five and then theres one leftover so this is five fifths plus five fifths plus five fifths plus five fifths plus one fifth right,1
teacher:Isaac,1
teacher:Go ahead and talk to him,1
teacher:So if I think about picking out fives I can pick out like this right,1
teacher:Okay talk to your neighbor,1
teacher:Okay but what if we do this,1
teacher:And youd end up with four and 2 tenths right,1
teacher:The 21 fifths could be one and 5 10 15 16 fifths right,1
teacher:Is that the same number,1
teacher:One and 16 fifths,1
teacher:one right,1
teacher:Okay so did I do that backwards,1
teacher:Alright whos a brave soul wholl read that number for us,1
teacher:Does that makes sense,1
teacher:Can we add those,1
teacher:Yeah so one and two thirds;student:One,1
teacher:Some of you are still thinking,1
teacher:Yeah so here well youll know if youre right right,1
teacher:14 plus 16 is 30 right,1
teacher:So the only other thing you could do is the middle right;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Okay everybody ready,1
teacher:So you put parentheses around the three plus two and the four minus two right,1
teacher:All right whats up guys,1
teacher:So our learning intention for today is Chase will you read it for us,1
teacher:No idea,1
teacher:Like a quiz,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:So if you asked me if I have five students with orange on and six students with blue on how many students are wearing Bronco colors,1
teacher:Alec will you read that for us,1
teacher:Actually it just is that quick isnt it,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:So Aiden will you say that out loud again,1
teacher:Anybody,1
teacher:Do you think abbreviating might help with that,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:All right switch,1
teacher:Gavin,1
teacher:So you you like the structure of the paragraph;student:They did a full paragraph with first and second and then they had a conclusion sentence,1
teacher:Anybody else,1
teacher:Dividend;student:Also did you know the numerator is the,1
teacher:Was that important,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:So we talked about how the numerator and the dividend are the same and the denominator and the divisor are the same right,1
teacher:Aiden,1
teacher:Max,1
teacher:Any more comments,1
teacher:Aiden,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:George,1
teacher:Jonathan,1
teacher:Say that again,1
teacher:Can you argue that way,1
teacher:So if I dont know the algorithm I dont know that you cant add thirds and halves could you prove to me that two thirds puts a half,1
teacher:Emmett,1
teacher:You want to go point at something,1
teacher:You knew that right Caleb,1
teacher:Aiden,1
teacher:Or just more than a half right;student:One of the numbers have to be half or a whole,1
teacher:Okay so the number you start with has to be more than half right,1
teacher:So is this correct,1
teacher:Brielle,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:We cant add fractions unless the denominators are alike right,1
teacher:So so if it was 4 1 2 3 4 5ths plus 312ths could we add this,1
teacher:Could we just go 1234567,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:So if I say you get three pieces out of all of these Im going to give you this piece and this piece and this piece is that fair;student:It means that you have to,1
teacher:So can we add them,1
teacher:Could I subtract a number from five twelfths and get to 5 tenths,1
teacher:Look at them on any of the tools that Im giving here,1
teacher:Would that be reasonable,1
teacher:To you,1
teacher:Could you convince me that it cant be three fifths,1
teacher:You all have one of these,1
teacher:Is there a way you could use that,1
teacher:Lyla,1
teacher:It would be more than one right;student:Im thinking you would have probably one sixth,1
teacher:I mean even if we dont know what three fifths is he knows that its less than a whole right,1
teacher:Aiden,1
teacher:Aiden,1
teacher:So those are the two things that I really wanted you guys to do but did you have something else to tell us Logan,1
teacher:So I assume youre ready,1
teacher:Does that answer make sense,1
teacher:Yes or no,1
teacher:Does the answer make sense,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:Caleb,1
teacher:All I want to know is does this answer make sense,1
teacher:So so we proved it like in three different ways right,1
teacher:Another another possibility would be to use fraction circles right,1
teacher:Tyler,1
teacher:Does somebody want to try reading this number for me,1
teacher:A whole;student:I technically included a whole,1
teacher:So one whole one plus one sixth equals one and one sixth or 7 sixths,1
teacher:Okay go ahead,1
teacher:So his problem like opened up a bunch right,1
teacher:Almost any denominator right,1
teacher:It also could be can you make a half out of a bunch of different a half with a bunch of different denominators,1
teacher:You guys understand what Im asking,1
teacher:Joey,1
teacher:Im sorry;student:Were there even be a half,1
teacher:So he had the same So he thought first it was nine fifths right,1
teacher:That is one anf four fifths right,1
teacher:A half plus a half equals a whole right,1
teacher:Cooper,1
teacher:Does that work,1
teacher:It looks like a much more complex problem though right,1
teacher:Did anybody use include a fraction that is not sixths in their sum,1
teacher:Does that make sense Gunner,1
teacher:Caleb,1
teacher:Haley,1
teacher:You would start with a half and then you would add a third to it right,1
teacher:Did you figure it out,1
teacher:And that is what five,1
teacher:Mia,1
teacher:So she figured out that it takes two sixths to cut for a third right,1
teacher:So a third is equal to two sixths and a half is equal to three sixths right,1
teacher:Does that makes sense,1
teacher:So so factors are when you multiply like like in this problem pay attention if you multiply two times three you get six right,1
teacher:So you guys are finding a common denominator right,1
teacher:Does that makes sense,1
teacher:You just cant touch each others fraction pieces okay,1
teacher:Richard will you read the learning intention please,1
teacher:Mia,1
teacher:So you need to break the fourth you need to break the two into one and five fourths right,1
teacher:Lydia,1
teacher:I just want to make sure that you guys kept up right,1
teacher:Do you see what were doing,1
teacher:What;student:Eight,1
teacher:That makes it really hard huh,1
teacher:Right Chase,1
teacher:And youre adding an eighth right,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:Okay and 110 is not very much right;student:One and one third,1
teacher:Joey,1
teacher:So Eli will you read organized information,1
teacher:Yeah so if you have to read the problem and understand what its asking right,1
teacher:If you already understand the problem then you can play with the information right,1
teacher:Does your answer make sense,1
teacher:Does your answer fit with the problem,1
teacher:Aaron,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:Cooper,1
teacher:Are you okay to move on,1
teacher:Or do you have to go back and play with the numbers again or re look at the problem,1
teacher:So in order to get to one and a half we would need one and four eighths right,1
teacher:So two thirds is the third away from a whole And a fourth is less than a third right,1
teacher:Okay so will you read Joeyary will you read the success criteria,1
teacher:So here are a couple of different diagrams that we have used before do you recognize these,1
teacher:Are you trying,1
teacher:These are not easy to do are they;student:Five plus six plus,1
teacher:Is this a sixth,1
teacher:Okay so um so now I know that I could use two sixths in there right,1
teacher:So two sixths plus 12345 6 12ths would be a sum I could use right,1
teacher:Four 8ths plus 3;student:I did four eighths plus 3,1
teacher:Did you say four eighths,1
teacher:What I see out here is  we have a fifth plus are these tenths,1
teacher:This is three twelfths right,1
teacher:Okay so then if we have so if we had two thirds 13 is four twelfths right;student:What I did kind of was I had two sixths I had two thirds,1
teacher:So if I say it again two thirds,1
teacher:So this would be another third right,1
teacher:Two twelfths,1
teacher:Any question about how to play,1
teacher:So you guys just I would suggest that you know I mean you can choose that one right,1
teacher:Are you guys listening,1
teacher:Parker,1
teacher:Eight hundred;student:32 million 800 thousand,1
teacher:I see two pieces two fourths,1
teacher:Do you want some more practice,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:You couldnt take four sixths away from one sixth right;student:I couldnt do one minus four,1
teacher:Can I show your work,1
teacher:Joey,1
teacher:Bridger,1
teacher:And so he took two minus one equals one right,1
teacher:So if you think that the answer is one and Okay so how many of you do this if you think that the answer is three sixths or one half,1
teacher:So you did this,1
teacher:Two minus one is one,1
teacher:And you got three sixths,1
teacher:He knew he had four sixths left to subtract right,1
teacher:But you cant take four sixths Can you take away four sixths from one sixth,1
teacher:Theres one two right,1
teacher:And one sixth would be this right,1
teacher:Thatd be like taking it away right,1
teacher:Aiden,1
teacher:So thats done right,1
teacher:Ashley,1
teacher:Two and a sixth is closest to zero;student:Zero,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:So if we know that the orange is our two thirds right,1
teacher:And we also need two thirds of a cup for the second recipe right,1
teacher:Sophia;student:Three,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:Bricker,1
teacher:Aiden,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:Anna call on somebody,1
teacher:George,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Patrick,1
teacher:Did you write it down,1
teacher:This is close to three;student:Three as a whole number,1
teacher:Yeah because a half would be three sixths right;student:One and a half,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Okay um for those of you who like algorithms you can take Tom did you have a question,1
teacher:Do you want to come up;student:So what I did,1
teacher:So he knew that half plus a half is a whole right,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:Can you add and subtract denominators,1
teacher:Cooper,1
teacher:Is that bigger than 13,1
teacher:So then we know that this is bigger than one right,1
teacher:Because it takes four pieces to make the whole right;student:A whole is four of fourths,1
teacher:So did you find the fourth,1
teacher:Talk to a partner,1
teacher:So anybody,1
teacher:Mia come on up,1
teacher:Because you cant call that two anything right,1
teacher:Come on up,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:Do we need some practice with equivalent fractions first,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Are you done,1
teacher:Sophia,1
teacher:Sophia will you read the success criteria please,1
teacher:But thats a one so you think would be the one minus one;student:And that means youd have three sixths,1
teacher:Correct,1
teacher:Can I show an easy way to show that,1
teacher:So he knew that you cant take four sixths from one sixth right,1
teacher:So if we take one away from this two and add it over here as a fraction that would be the same as moving this over here right,1
teacher:So one and seven sixths is the same as two and one six right,1
teacher:Do you guys see how we did that,1
teacher:Two,1
teacher:Andrea,1
teacher:equivalent fractions the actual meaning of them is that there are two fractions that have the same value right,1
teacher:Remember how you used the multiplication rule for coming up with equivalent fractions,1
teacher:Right Patrick,1
teacher:If they have the same denominator than the same size pieces,1
teacher:Correct,1
teacher:And so are those so if we lay these on top of each other they would be exactly the same right,1
teacher:Ilea,1
teacher:Tom,1
teacher:Okay who do I see  whos ready give me a thumbs up,1
teacher:So if one fifth is three three threefifths is nine right,1
teacher:So to find one fifth we divide by five right,1
teacher:Hudson,1
teacher:Laura,1
teacher:What is it;student:I really think he just needed to add more explaining and how he thought to that point and what is it,1
teacher:Tyler,1
teacher:Addie,1
teacher:Who noticed that,1
teacher:Im done,1
teacher:What;student:2 times,1
teacher:Is that my answer,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Are you sure,1
teacher:try to get 12;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Can we do this,1
teacher:Did anyone get it,1
teacher:410,1
teacher:Kate,1
teacher:Asher,1
teacher:Ariana,1
teacher:Natalie,1
teacher:Laura,1
teacher:Faith;student:In art if youre making a design and you dont like it you can go back and change it,1
teacher:Kate;student:Yeah make it better,1
teacher:Miles,1
teacher:Ariana;student:Make sure every single question is how you liked it,1
teacher:Hudson,1
teacher:Mason,1
teacher:Miles,1
teacher:Noah,1
teacher:Skyler,1
teacher:Natalie,1
teacher:Kate,1
teacher:Miles,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Hudson,1
teacher:Hunter,1
teacher:Brendan,1
teacher:Do I see half,1
teacher:Elaina;student:Theyre equivalent fractions because they are each a half but theyre just different,1
teacher:Classetyclass,1
teacher:2;student:We thought it was 8822,1
teacher:Skyler,1
teacher:11;student:Number three I think its 7811,1
teacher:Were going to read it together,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:One two three,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you would like to share something you notice,1
teacher:A number line;student:I dont know what its called,1
teacher:Raise your hand,1
teacher:Savannah,1
teacher:Together,1
teacher:One two three,1
teacher:Who can read the directions at the top of page 169,1
teacher:Hadley,1
teacher:32,1
teacher:Macaroni and cheese,1
teacher:Dan,1
teacher:Next one,1
teacher:Ariana,1
teacher:Ariana what did Laura say;student:Theyre all half,1
teacher:Got it,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:What is what;student:What is 6,1
teacher:Can you solve,1
teacher:14  13 correct,1
teacher:You can look back check your work and understand it better maybe,1
teacher:Okay when you figure out how many 12s  14  13 gives me a thumbs up,1
teacher:Isabelle,1
teacher:34;student:34,1
teacher:Before we start who would like to read the first one,1
teacher:Who would like to read,1
teacher:Sean,1
teacher:Who would like to read the second one,1
teacher:Jackson,1
teacher:Okay so raise your hands  like to share;student:I dont even know,1
teacher:Faith,1
teacher:Nate,1
teacher:Ethan,1
teacher:Hunter,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Three two one,1
teacher:So its says Who can read number one,1
teacher:What does number one say what does number one say,1
teacher:Nice and loud so we can all hear,1
teacher:Number two;student:You should see the outline on the book of the sailboat,1
teacher:Hey Mason,1
teacher:So do you see your list of coordinates or ordered pairs for your original sailboat,1
teacher:Nate,1
teacher:Who is back and ready;student:Miss maam can I have a sticky note,1
teacher:Do you mean 51,1
teacher:Kate,1
teacher:Were just going here right,1
teacher:Ariana,1
teacher:Noah,1
teacher:Natalie,1
teacher:Trey,1
teacher:Okay you think its two;student:Perhaps a two,1
teacher:Class,1
teacher:Tyler,1
teacher:Mason,1
teacher:Everybody is ready;student:I also figured out something that we could,1
teacher:Who else is ready,1
teacher:On one two three show me your boards,1
teacher:One two three show me,1
teacher:One two three show,1
teacher:Should we try;student:Thats eight blocks away,1
teacher:One two three show me your boards,1
teacher:Chase,1
teacher:Kate,1
teacher:Basically youre thinking like we said one minus one is zero;student:Zero,1
teacher:Macaroni and cheese,1
teacher:Brendan,1
teacher:Does that sound right,1
teacher:Hunter,1
teacher:The first one is 162 this one would be 102 this one would be 1014 right;student:Double it just says  just eight times two and then one times two,1
teacher:Were going to start with I will okay ready,1
teacher:Im on page 42 Ethan,1
teacher:Rylee,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:So this is a sample answer huh,1
teacher:Emanual,1
teacher:Only the X Emanual,1
teacher:To the left;student:I said it would move to the left and get a little wider,1
teacher:So this should be your order pairs correct;student:And doubling it would make it go this way,1
teacher:So we connect back to the origin correct,1
teacher:Who heard what Amarilla said;student:But now looking on the board and whats up there I noticed that I couldve done better with the vocabulary that I used,1
teacher:Can someone repeat what Amarilla said,1
teacher:Ethan what did Amarilla say,1
teacher:Any other points of improvement in your own that you noticed after looking at the sample responses;student:And that she shouldve added more vocabulary,1
teacher:Eugene,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:What does number three say,1
teacher:Cece,1
teacher:Who can read that next question,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:1 2 3,1
teacher:Nadia,1
teacher:Kenneth,1
teacher:Open up your map journal to page 141 and then show me a thumbs up when youre on page 141 141 thumbs up,1
teacher:Scott say that louder,1
teacher:What;student:Wouldnt it so shouldnt it be like where one sides flat and one is to the side,1
teacher:Miranda,1
teacher:Skyler,1
teacher:Priscilla,1
teacher:Katalina,1
teacher:Ethan,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Extrapolate;student:Extrapolate,1
teacher:Priscilla,1
teacher:Who would like to read one number one again to the class,1
teacher:Miranda,1
teacher:Dexter,1
teacher:Classetyclass,1
teacher:Classetyclass,1
teacher:Classetyclass,1
teacher:Turn and talk to your partner,1
teacher:Ariana,1
teacher:Hadley;student:Three fourths,1
teacher:All you see is eight squares Skyler;student:Eight,1
teacher:Nolan,1
teacher:Addie,1
teacher:Hunter,1
teacher:Nate,1
teacher:Connor,1
teacher:You notice how it only went up to three fourths,1
teacher:Ben,1
teacher:Hadley,1
teacher:Lists of five how are you feeling,1
teacher:Okay I want you to be truthful raise your hand if youre struggling thinking about an equivalent fraction,1
teacher:Hunter,1
teacher:By fourths;student:I think its by four,1
teacher:Laura,1
teacher:Zachary,1
teacher:Turn and talk to your partner,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Alexis,1
teacher:Bryson,1
teacher:Dan,1
teacher:Alexis,1
teacher:Grace,1
teacher:Connor,1
teacher:Miles,1
teacher:Remember,1
teacher:Remember our pan of brownies,1
teacher:So do you see this one up here,1
teacher:Hunter,1
teacher:Is it going to be half,1
teacher:Is it going to be thirds,1
teacher:Fourths fifths sixths sevenths eighths,1
teacher:Kate and Natalie thats it,1
teacher:Whos noticing multiplication patterns;student:So you can do the five times four thatS0,1
teacher:Eli,1
teacher:So really you just multiplied 22 to get 28  and thats equivalent,1
teacher:Savannah;student:48104,1
teacher:3684;student:3684,1
teacher:Yeah Miles,1
teacher:Natalie,1
teacher:Mmhmm  Kate;student:By doing the same number times the numerator and denominator it will make it equivalent as  because you did the same thing for both the numerator and denominator,1
teacher:Savannah,1
teacher:Is that changing my number,1
teacher:Everyone say multiplicative,1
teacher:Identity;student:Multiplicative,1
teacher:Property;student:Identity,1
teacher:Multiplicative;student:Property,1
teacher:Identity;student:Multiplicative,1
teacher:Property;student:Identity,1
teacher:Multiplicative identity property;student:Property,1
teacher:Natalie,1
teacher:Six times three and then six times seven 42  Hunter;student:Its 42,1
teacher:Whats eight times wait did I say eight right,1
teacher:Brendan;student:I didnt get that far that was all I had,1
teacher:2456 Tyler;student:2456,1
teacher:So could I do 14 times 33,1
teacher:Could I do 14 times 44,1
teacher:Could I do 14 times 55,1
teacher:66,1
teacher:77,1
teacher:88,1
teacher:99,1
teacher:What did you notice,1
teacher:1010,1
teacher:Bum Bum de bum bum,1
teacher:Hadley,1
teacher:Leah;student:69,1
teacher:Nolan;student:812,1
teacher:Eli,1
teacher:Hunter;student:I noticed that too,1
teacher:Natalie,1
teacher:Turn to your knee to knee partner and go,1
teacher:Stand up and sit down when youre done,1
teacher:Anyone else,1
teacher:Did anyone write down a question,1
teacher:Turn and talk with your partner,1
teacher:Bom ba da bom bom,1
teacher:Mason,1
teacher:Agree,1
teacher:Miles,1
teacher:Do we have to find the common denominator when multiplying;student:Depends  Because its an odd number the three is you have to go all the way back to another number that would get it remotely close to three fourths which in my opinion would be,1
teacher:Did we have to find a common denominator when multiplying up here,1
teacher:Cooper,1
teacher:Bom ba da bom bom,1
teacher:Im only going to write something down right now youre not going to write anything down okay,1
teacher:Bom ba da bom bom,1
teacher:Bom ba da bom bom,1
teacher:Mason,1
teacher:Natalie,1
teacher:Hadley,1
teacher:Quinn,1
teacher:Ariana,1
teacher:Asher,1
teacher:Is that about halfway,1
teacher:Are they different;student:I notice that theyre the exact same answers but theyre different problems,1
teacher:Turn and talk to your kneetoknee partner about these two rules,1
teacher:Classetyclass,1
teacher:Hadley,1
teacher:Theyre both division right;student:If you do 15 times 15 the second is 51 so once you get that answer which is 155 then you just divide it 15 by five so its just a quicker way to do it,1
teacher:Correct,1
teacher:Then we have it divided by five right,1
teacher:Turn and talk to your partner,1
teacher:Classetyclass,1
teacher:Its very similar right,1
teacher:Read the directions for number five,1
teacher:Yeah;student:Nate came up with a really good strategy for these problems,1
teacher:You know what Im saying now,1
teacher:Are you guys done,1
teacher:What;student:T nothing equals 13,1
teacher:About halfway here does that look about halfway to you,1
teacher:Brendan,1
teacher:Im going to read the whole problem and were not going to do anything until Im done okay,1
teacher:Daniel,1
teacher:Classity class,1
teacher:Six and Who would like to read this decimal,1
teacher:Savannah,1
teacher:SS,1
teacher:SS,1
teacher:Miles,1
teacher:The 1000th place is less than the 100th place correct;student:nine is in the 1000th place and the other is in the 100th place and the 100th place is always higher than the 1000th place,1
teacher:What;student:Thousandths,1
teacher:Bryson,1
teacher:Sydney,1
teacher:Colton,1
teacher:Call on someone to help you,1
teacher:Who remembers that,1
teacher:Questions you have if you dont notice anything,1
teacher:Who would like to share questions they have;student:Everybody freeze,1
teacher:Show me,1
teacher:Show me on your fingers,1
teacher:Okay thumbs up if you have your paper looking like mine now;student:Bom bom,1
teacher:Bom ba da bom bom,1
teacher:Bom ba da bom bom,1
teacher:You have it in thirds;student:Bom bom,1
teacher:Classity class;student:Yes,1
teacher:Asher,1
teacher:Classity class,1
teacher:Classity class;student:Some random guy came and stole her pizza,1
teacher:Bom ba da bom bom,1
teacher:Harper,1
teacher:Do you see problem number one;student:Bom bom,1
teacher:Bom ba da bom bom,1
teacher:Who would like to read number two,1
teacher:Just the directions and then Ill have someone read A Leah,1
teacher:A who would like to read A;student:What is three quarters of one third,1
teacher:Ariana,1
teacher:So I started Bom ba da bom bom,1
teacher:Kate,1
teacher:Okay how many more minutes do you and your partner need for problem 1A,1
teacher:You guys get that,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:You did a different route;student:I know,1
teacher:Aiden,1
teacher:So basically we have Now you guys have been doing this forever right,1
teacher:Youve been multiplying the numerator times the numerator and the denominator times the denominator but now you guys have a way to prove it right,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:Yep,1
teacher:What;student:We need to pass,1
teacher:Okay so  intention please,1
teacher:So and if you think about this in order if you think about this as a green chili and egg breakfast casserole group A took these two all of it right,1
teacher:Okay so a number sentence to express that and then show or explain how you used the picture to solve the problem okay;student:casserole that group B took,1
teacher:Anybody else want to share,1
teacher:Do you want to go back to the question;student:Because it says,1
teacher:Carson,1
teacher:The area model;student:I dont think subtraction correlates with  used for multiplying two fractions together,1
teacher:Okay what do you think Carson;student:I respectfully disagree,1
teacher:But you like that they used subtraction as well or you at least understand what they did with it;student:so if they did eleventwelfths minus eighttwelfths which is greatest,1
teacher:The 10 represents the double shaded right,1
teacher:Talk to your neighbor,1
teacher:You want to try it,1
teacher:Landon,1
teacher:Stand up when youre done,1
teacher:So on the horizontal axis everybody say horizontal axis,1
teacher:So one third two thirds and then this will be three thirds right,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:So anybody have questions about that,1
teacher:Again you can check with your neighbor when One third times did I say three fifths,1
teacher:Joey,1
teacher:Cooper,1
teacher:That is truly the answer right,1
teacher:Isaac,1
teacher:How many;student:How many squares are on the bottom,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:Six times five is 30;student:Six times five,1
teacher:Joey,1
teacher:So we have an array right,1
teacher:The five sixths one way and the two fifths the other way;student:Even though we know its going to be 10 we can find it on an area model by shading in,1
teacher:Talk to your shoulder partner,1
teacher:What was that;student:I was going to say that they use math strategy for their number,1
teacher:The area  for multiplying fractions;student:It was oh I forget the name but  really recently its where you get the,1
teacher:You what;student:Because I divided it by half 22,1
teacher:Because Ella ate 22;student:I divided 22 in half,1
teacher:So we want half of 22 right,1
teacher:If we didnt know how to do that we could just take those 36 carrots and divide it into groups of three right,1
teacher:Did you do this,1
teacher:Did you ever do this,1
teacher:Okay so we just basically passed out all of the carrots right,1
teacher:Does that make sense to you,1
teacher:Okay so if I say does that make sense,1
teacher:You can give me a thumbs up,1
teacher:Or you can nod your head,1
teacher:Do we have So we know that 11 is more than 12 right,1
teacher:So we know that Jackson,1
teacher:Are there any questions about this one,1
teacher:So this would be one way right,1
teacher:Are you listening,1
teacher:Okay Avery are you guys listening;student:He has 36,1
teacher:Ella did;student:Ella,1
teacher:Sophia,1
teacher:So the onethird is the leftover portion;student:Its because right here  this way,1
teacher:So wouldnt we be talking about the leftover portion,1
teacher:This is a fourth;student:Fourths,1
teacher:Huh,1
teacher:Onethird  onethird right,1
teacher:So we have onethird is left after group A eats right,1
teacher:Group B ate this much right,1
teacher:Is that a third,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:So it depends on what youre talking about as the whole right,1
teacher:Were on lesson 3 Will you read the learning intention,1
teacher:So this is showing that we divided something in four parts right,1
teacher:Mia will you read it please,1
teacher:Isaac,1
teacher:Avery,1
teacher:Cooper,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Are you guys with me,1
teacher:Hey take off when youre done,1
teacher:Is George with us,1
teacher:So can I have your folding part,1
teacher:So first you folded counting right,1
teacher:So you folded it maybe this way into thirds,1
teacher:Two out of the three parts;student:Two thirds of it,1
teacher:Yall see that,1
teacher:The whole is two thirds,1
teacher:You pulled it into the other direction;student:I did it to the side,1
teacher:So this way,1
teacher:So we should have three parts this way you guys,1
teacher:So it would be this and this,1
teacher:One;student:I dont have it,1
teacher:So wherever its doubleshaded right,1
teacher:Am I right,1
teacher:Its not really a lot different than what we did yesterday right,1
teacher:Talk to your partners,1
teacher:You did;student:Yes,1
teacher:Its greater than;student:Its greater,1
teacher:So did you do the folding part,1
teacher:You multiplied;student:Well I multiplied four and,1
teacher:Do you see that,1
teacher:Whats up guys,1
teacher:Aaron,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Is that what you said,1
teacher:So conceptually 13 times two thirds means 13 two thirds right,1
teacher:13 of them right;student:Two,1
teacher:Were asking for 13 out of two thirds right,1
teacher:So we could add up two thirds 13 times right,1
teacher:So if we did that 13 times were going to have two times 13 right,1
teacher:So same answer different slightly different ways to think about it right,1
teacher:Alec,1
teacher:John,1
teacher:Questions,1
teacher:Four ninths;student:Four ninths,1
teacher:Did anybody fold and shade a sheet of paper to find two thirds of two thirds,1
teacher:So one of the factors is in yellow right,1
teacher:Do you see that,1
teacher:So that yellow was two thirds so the yellow slashes are two thirds and the product is four ninths so the four ninths have  right,1
teacher:What;student:I just said one,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Matt,1
teacher:Mia,1
teacher:Is everybody with me,1
teacher:Joey,1
teacher:Two by two;student:Its two by two,1
teacher:Did you guys all write that down,1
teacher:Peyton;student:Basically nothing,1
teacher:So here the full line is  right,1
teacher:It just goes to here right,1
teacher:16 so those are 16ths;student:16,1
teacher:Peyton,1
teacher:Questions,1
teacher:So sometimes if what youre rounding to is very close to the next number youre going to have to round up a couple of numbers right,1
teacher:Talk to your neighbor,1
teacher:Nine;student:Nine,1
teacher:Huh,1
teacher:So what do see is labeled;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:Two thirds is bigger so the factors are bigger right;student:Two thirds,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:That the factors are bigger when taking two thirds of two thirds,1
teacher:Are you guys ready,1
teacher:Is that what you were talking about,1
teacher:Caleb,1
teacher:Kevin,1
teacher:So I want you to work with your shoulder partner,1
teacher:Can you stand up and show everybody so they can all see your paper;student:So paper to show,1
teacher:Landon do you have something to ask him,1
teacher:Because when were talking about area were talking about length times width right,1
teacher:If you think about Jen number one right,1
teacher:If you take a fraction of one you would take half of one we can all think of that and we know that the product is going to be less than one right,1
teacher:So if you think of this two thirds as it being a number this is just a number and were taking a fraction of it so it is going to be smaller than the number that we started with right,1
teacher:Isaac,1
teacher:Three by three;student:Three by three,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Miles,1
teacher:So I told you when we have a problem like this we have two different ways right,1
teacher:Mason,1
teacher:One two three,1
teacher:Now you guys,1
teacher:One two three go,1
teacher:Lets try that again,1
teacher:One two three go,1
teacher:Show me horizontal,1
teacher:Show me vertical,1
teacher:Horizontal,1
teacher:Vertical,1
teacher:Horizontal,1
teacher:Vertical,1
teacher:Horizontal,1
teacher:Horizontal,1
teacher:Vertical,1
teacher:Horizontal,1
teacher:Now you go,1
teacher:Vertical,1
teacher:Okay ready,1
teacher:Mason,1
teacher:Are you closer to filling in this whole square;student:Yellow square,1
teacher:Are you closer to this yellow square Lilian;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Closer to filling in the thousandths that lasts thousandths piece right;student:Closer to the one in the thousandths square,1
teacher:Laura,1
teacher:Kate,1
teacher:Everyone have that so far,1
teacher:Steven,1
teacher:So sorry Eli,1
teacher:Sorry Eli,1
teacher:Who can read problem four on 124,1
teacher:John,1
teacher:One two three show me your boards,1
teacher:Class,1
teacher:One two three show me your boards,1
teacher:Show me what you have so far,1
teacher:Im going to read it first then you guys are going to read it second okay,1
teacher:Vertical,1
teacher:Horizontal,1
teacher:Vertical,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Sydney,1
teacher:What;student:U,1
teacher:U;student:U,1
teacher:Kate,1
teacher:When you have it give me a thumbs up;student:I have it too,1
teacher:Tyler,1
teacher:Raise your hand when you know,1
teacher:Eli;student:I know,1
teacher:Nate,1
teacher:Brendan,1
teacher:Mason,1
teacher:Leo;student:I know,1
teacher:Brendan,1
teacher:Kate,1
teacher:Did you take a different route;student:Thats not how I measured,1
teacher:Correct,1
teacher:You have the school to the grocery store correct;student:You can go up here and then around here to the grocery store,1
teacher:Mason,1
teacher:Vertical,1
teacher:Horizontal,1
teacher:Point to it when you find it,1
teacher:Did any of you start by looking at the coordinates,1
teacher:Now do you know where Tralee is,1
teacher:Raise your hand,1
teacher:Hadley,1
teacher:Mason,1
teacher:Colton,1
teacher:You see that Miles,1
teacher:Your partner is number one,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:One two three,1
teacher:Mason,1
teacher:Leo,1
teacher:Laura,1
teacher:Miles,1
teacher:Miles,1
teacher:Is it four or less let it rest or is it five or more raise the score to 62 or are we going to keep it at 61,1
teacher:How are you feeling right now,1
teacher:Ariana;student:15,1
teacher:Did anybody else get there,1
teacher:So we recognize ones place the tenths hundredths thousandths,1
teacher:Hunter,1
teacher:Eli;student:When it says every other tenth and one it adds a zero every time to the decimal,1
teacher:Noah,1
teacher:Quinn;student:If you were to do 1200 you would get 1000 200,1
teacher:Do you see expanded form on this slide,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Mason,1
teacher:WilNoah,1
teacher:Are we starting to recognize these words again,1
teacher:One two three show me your boards,1
teacher:Asher,1
teacher:The tenths place,1
teacher:Nolan,1
teacher:Raise your boards clean one and two,1
teacher:Correct,1
teacher:Daniel;student:Do you want all of these cards,1
teacher:Faith,1
teacher:Kate,1
teacher:One two three show me your boards;student:10 to the power of two,1
teacher:Faith,1
teacher:Elena,1
teacher:One two three show me your boards,1
teacher:3000,1
teacher:One two three show me your boards;student:Everybody freeze,1
teacher:2000;student:Agree,1
teacher:Show me,1
teacher:You need to show me,1
teacher:Yes Mason;student:Skyler,1
teacher:Talk with your partner,1
teacher:Talk with your partner,1
teacher:Daniel,1
teacher:Ariana,1
teacher:Natalie;student:Hundredths,1
teacher:Mason,1
teacher:Kate,1
teacher:And we will know were successful in three two one go,1
teacher:Does that sounds familiar,1
teacher:Noah,1
teacher:Hudson,1
teacher:When youre on 123 give me a thumbs up,1
teacher:Okay whos ready with their thumbs up looking at me,1
teacher:123 Whos ready,1
teacher:Miles,1
teacher:Nolan,1
teacher:But you and your partner shouldve figured out that at halfway that five right,1
teacher:It wouldnt make sense to say its closer to two tenths after that reasoning would it,1
teacher:Are we feeling this the five,1
teacher:How were feeling,1
teacher:Sound good,1
teacher:So how are we feeling right now,1
teacher:Were going to read this one together in three two one go,1
teacher:Laura,1
teacher:Brendan,1
teacher:Raise your hand if youd like to,1
teacher:This and this are both not quite a whole correct;student:I agree with Mason that its 34 hundredths,1
teacher:Hudson,1
teacher:Three tens is larger right;student:All ready,1
teacher:So Id write that out as Did anyone write it as a greater than or less than,1
teacher:Something like that;student:Yes,1
teacher:One two three show me your boards,1
teacher:Sophie;student:No,1
teacher:So were thinking is it closer to three and 61 hundreds are we going to keep it,1
teacher:Addie,1
teacher:Hudson;student:I disagree with him,1
teacher:Do you guys want to see me do this part,1
teacher:Problems,1
teacher:Did we do the last one,1
teacher:One more;student:Can we do one more please,1
teacher:Was there one or two,1
teacher:James come up here,1
teacher:Nate,1
teacher:You got it;student:Yes I got it,1
teacher:Question,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Did we do better on the other one;student:Good,1
teacher:24;student:24,1
teacher:T and F;student:Its T and F,1
teacher:Yes;student:T,1
teacher:Greater than is the expression greater than 45 times nine,1
teacher:Do I need to know what 45 times nine is at all,1
teacher:Do you understand why I asked if you needed to know exactly what 45 times nine was,1
teacher:Is the value of the expression less than 790 plus 212,1
teacher:Yes no yes no,1
teacher:Stand when youre done,1
teacher:What Adam,1
teacher:Got it,1
teacher:Is the value of the expression less than,1
teacher:So you stand when youre done,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Howd we do buddy;student:There Im done,1
teacher:Whats your question,1
teacher:Are your partners good,1
teacher:I would like you to do the triple okay,1
teacher:You did very good,1
teacher:Think of your number line okay,1
teacher:Lets do a number line okay,1
teacher:A four half three okay;student:16 is a half if Im right,1
teacher:Im just doing it in fourths okay,1
teacher:Because I want you to be able to see halves okay,1
teacher:So if I run that all the way out to five okay,1
teacher:Five okay;student:Uhhuh  she assigned some people something else so Id ask her which one she wants you to do,1
teacher:Theres one in between there that I missed okay,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:Are you done,1
teacher:Okay you guys did you triple;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:Did you do your next one,1
teacher:You need a partner to work with okay,1
teacher:You guys good,1
teacher:So is the RC going to get taller and narrower,1
teacher:You are right but all the way around;student:It made it bigger,1
teacher:Are you done;student:Im right here,1
teacher:Mark it right,1
teacher:You see what I did;student:four eight,1
teacher:Youre finished;student:We finished,1
teacher:Did you do the rubric,1
teacher:See what you did,1
teacher:How are you doing on your math this morning,1
teacher:Youre doing okay today,1
teacher:Are you sure,1
teacher:Did you do your rubric and circle what you think you should put on it;student:Its driving me crazy,1
teacher:Am I correct,1
teacher:Zeros my first line right;student:Okay nine zero,1
teacher:When youve got an answer please stand up,1
teacher:I also want you to think about if I am doubling the size of a book if I am doubling the size of the book am I only doubling one part of it,1
teacher:Does that actually double it,1
teacher:Or do I need to double both parts of it,1
teacher:So you see how I got my five one,1
teacher:Do you understand coordinate grids at all;student:He draws a picture,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:So you think you need to explain why it okay;student:Why it works because the X coordinate made it wider and wouldnt make it if you wasnt doubling the Y coordinate,1
teacher:Youve finished that whole page,1
teacher:Pete are you done,1
teacher:Youre done;student:I got it,1
teacher:Matt to stand up please;student:To,1
teacher:How many of you talked about the coordinates in your writing,1
teacher:How many of you used the word double or twice,1
teacher:How many of you used the exact words X coordinate Y coordinate,1
teacher:Oh are you good,1
teacher:What do you think,1
teacher:Oh so I need both of them in order to make this work;student:You just did the first one,1
teacher:Oh I have to move that to four or to two right;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Is that better,1
teacher:Does the new trapezoid look the way you expected,1
teacher:Brogan,1
teacher:Does it look the way you thought it would,1
teacher:Who did I not give an Eagle Buck to that answered a question,1
teacher:Did I do what I needed to do,1
teacher:Did he explain what he did to the coordinates,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:Okay theres my grid okay,1
teacher:So you said one and a half am I correct,1
teacher:Does that make sense;student:Seveneighths is closer to one than it is half and fivesixths is closer to one than it is half then its pretty much one minus one,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Hi Mr Oliver,1
teacher:Okay Mr Oliver,1
teacher:Oh so you would turn it into eightfourths minus threefourths;student:And then what I would do is I would take the two and turn it into eighths so I make it more easy and minus the twofourths probably eight which would get sixfourths,1
teacher:When you are done stand up,1
teacher:Youre supposed to stand when you are done,1
teacher:Okay when youve got it stand up,1
teacher:When youve got it stand up,1
teacher:Like that okay,1
teacher:Does yours look like mine;student:Including my partner,1
teacher:Okay when you are done doing that put your hands on your head;student:Okay,1
teacher:Is this line straight,1
teacher:So I would like you to connect because this has to be connected here in order for this to be correct right,1
teacher:Okay you thought a half;student:Bless you,1
teacher:What are you confused with,1
teacher:Or one one and a half two okay;student:Well one,1
teacher:Yeah you know what I like about coordinates too Maddy;student:I asked her to bring me home some because I love coordinates so much,1
teacher:I did I made a perfect square didnt I,1
teacher:Mr Julian,1
teacher:You ready to talk to me,1
teacher:Do you see what I did;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Does it work every time;student:And thats when I think youre making,1
teacher:Trying to figure out if it does;student:Ive kind of been looking at it and trying to figure out,1
teacher:And three plus 14 would be 17 right,1
teacher:One two three,1
teacher:You are at the movie theater your friend is at another location on the map that is nine blocks away,1
teacher:When youve got it raise your hand,1
teacher:And when you got it raise your hand,1
teacher:Is it eight away there,1
teacher:Okay so you see how youre going to play this,1
teacher:So you think eight seven;student:I was three off at my first guess,1
teacher:Yes maam;student:I,1
teacher:When youve got your answers to both of those stand up please,1
teacher:Am I right,1
teacher:This ones a lot squattier isnt it,1
teacher:What are you struggling with my friend,1
teacher:Zeroone would be right here and then you needed to connect that okay,1
teacher:Then we go twoone and then we go sevenone and then we go eightone see,1
teacher:16two is right there right,1
teacher:Okay you guys are all done right,1
teacher:Okay so here who has not shared;student:Yes,1
teacher:You two need to share,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:You guys did yours together right,1
teacher:And did you discuss;student:We discussed it too,1
teacher:Okay you four are going to do triple the second number of the ordered pair on the next page and you are going to complete problems one two three four okay,1
teacher:Okay and you guys are good right,1
teacher:Have you checked all your work together,1
teacher:Check your work and you guys are all checked;student:We did,1
teacher:I havent given you directions for this page right,1
teacher:Why cant you do four and a half,1
teacher:Okay so we made a little bit of an error here okay,1
teacher:When you are done I will be ready to  And I need things like twice as tall twice as wide twice as  Those are the words you need to be using okay,1
teacher:Two times bigger or double the size okay;student:Double,1
teacher:Got it,1
teacher:What dont you get;student:I just dont get this,1
teacher:When its asking you to double each number okay,1
teacher:Okay so do you see how I got those numbers;student:Two,1
teacher:Then you did 10two right,1
teacher:Yeah right there okay,1
teacher:So now you need to draw a line this over to there okay,1
teacher:So horizontal vertical okay;student:I didnt see that at the bottom here,1
teacher:Does that make sense;student:Okay that,1
teacher:That help,1
teacher:Did you compare them;student:Im done,1
teacher:If I give you the numbers you should be able to do this,1
teacher:Huh;student:Where did I get the seven,1
teacher:We always do X first okay,1
teacher:So eightone so I would come over here to eight and then I would go up to one okay,1
teacher:Go all the way up and then you would put a dot and then you would connect those two okay,1
teacher:Good job now youre going to get a straight edge and youre going to connect those two okay,1
teacher:All right how we doing,1
teacher:Can I,1
teacher:Did he explain how the book was going to change;student:Yes,1
teacher:Yeah kind of;student:Yes,1
teacher:Is it one minus four;student:And then,1
teacher:Evan repeat what your new learning is about please,1
teacher:How many of you did five minus one equals four,1
teacher:Okay so how many of you used a fraction in your estimate,1
teacher:did you use a fraction in your estimate,1
teacher:So they subtracted a one okay,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Yes sir,1
teacher:So were going to look here You think youve done this one right,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Haley did you get this one,1
teacher:Oh up here,1
teacher:Can you try the next one on your own,1
teacher:Did you do your multiplication and then your subtraction right,1
teacher:No with common denominator you got it,1
teacher:So does that make sense,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Gentlemen,1
teacher:Im going to have the two of you compare your answers talk about what you did,1
teacher:Adam Michael,1
teacher:Anyone else still working on this,1
teacher:All right you got it sweetheart,1
teacher:Ronnie,1
teacher:Ronnie,1
teacher:So do you understand what Im telling you,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:Everybody,1
teacher:ready,1
teacher:When you have written all three of them go ahead and stand,1
teacher:down the answer please stand,1
teacher:And once again when you have answered stand up,1
teacher:How are you,1
teacher:Okay was that pretty easy for everybody,1
teacher:Right now you need to be following directions okay,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Bum ba dum bum bum,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:Has anybody do you think your boss will say hey I want you to do some addition of decimals but I want you to do it in partial sums,1
teacher:Im sorry what;student:Its,1
teacher:I can have four of something versus a half of something right,1
teacher:Aaron,1
teacher:Zach,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Go ahead buddy,1
teacher:Okay the 3 times 15 does it equal 15,1
teacher:Did you really take 5 and split,1
teacher:So did you all understand what Blake said,1
teacher:Of those of you standing did you get 3 for the first answer,1
teacher:You did a math warmup for me didnt you Mental Math;student:so I dont want to multiply the denominator  the numerator  and I got 70,1
teacher:Did you not answer a Mental Math,1
teacher:Did you all learn a new strategy,1
teacher:Who did I miss that answered a warmup question and I did not give an  bump to,1
teacher:A Mental Math,1
teacher:Two right,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:Make sense now,1
teacher:Does that make more sense,1
teacher:Three,1
teacher:Show me your answers,1
teacher:Im going to have you go first,1
teacher:Did you think Haley was right,1
teacher:Mila,1
teacher:Start talking,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:But you did nothing wrong did you,1
teacher:You see how you need to write that,1
teacher:Or am I closer to eight;student:Oh okay,1
teacher:Thats what I want you to write up there okay,1
teacher:Zach you got your boxes and everything done,1
teacher:Question,1
teacher:Say this for me,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:Yes sir,1
teacher:Do your rules sound like that one,1
teacher:Zach are you redoing yours,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:Did your rule do what you originally were supposed to do,1
teacher:Did it make Jakes book bigger,1
teacher:Larger,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:So my five friends that are done could you please come and stand right here so I can hear what youve done,1
teacher:I want to know what changes you made and Im going to start with you Hannah,1
teacher:Should that be in your rule,1
teacher:Did they put the answer to how big it would be in the rule;student:I dont know,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Continue though,1
teacher:Did they have the original coordinates in that response;student:Yeah,1
teacher:So should the original coordinates be in that response;student:Yes,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:your height coordinate;student:Because we did,1
teacher:Did you add any coordinates in there though;student:And I changed bigger to larger,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:Because I dont have anything all the way over to 15 do I;student:Yeah they dont have that,1
teacher:Read it out loud,1
teacher:But did you tell me how it was going to increase the units,1
teacher:Just because you give a rule of doubling or tripling or quadrupling did not give a complete response did it,1
teacher:Thats pretty simple isnt it,1
teacher:How many of you used the thing longer or wider,1
teacher:Do you think that goes with longer and wider,1
teacher:Did it get longer,1
teacher:Did it get wider;student:Yes,1
teacher:Did he validate what he did,1
teacher:You two were not partners am I right,1
teacher:Remember how we did it the other day when we looked at both the answers and we decided if it met what we wanted it to meet,1
teacher:So can this be answered at the very beginning completely,1
teacher:So if I look at Jakes original book is this book taller,1
teacher:Is this book wider;student:Yes,1
teacher:Did they do that,1
teacher:Do you see what Im saying,1
teacher:Did you put them throughout,1
teacher:Did you put the finished results throughout using the original and the final,1
teacher:Go ahead Ronnie,1
teacher:Go ahead continue,1
teacher:Go ahead Haley,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:go ahead,1
teacher:Not getting it;student:I dont get it,1
teacher:How do you not getting it,1
teacher:Go ahead Mason Im sorry,1
teacher:So can your rule work at all;student:Oh,1
teacher:Is it,1
teacher:Okay go ahead,1
teacher:Oh your ending coordinates are four and five right;student:Oh I was talking,1
teacher:Blake youre up buddy,1
teacher:Go ahead continue because youll go back and add what youre missed,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Okay go ahead,1
teacher:Do those sound like the same thing,1
teacher:Go ahead Ronnie,1
teacher:Okay go ahead,1
teacher:Carter are you done;student:And it would be taller and wider,1
teacher:Zach go ahead,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Can I stop you for just a second,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Maddy I think you were next,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Okay go ahead,1
teacher:Go ahead Matt,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:So you know what you need to add there right;student:Its the coordinate,1
teacher:See what you need to add;student:Tall,1
teacher:Okay go ahead,1
teacher:Okay so go ahead,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Instead of double you just meant triple both coordinates;student:I meant triple,1
teacher:The thing;student:And then originally we said I think the picture will change and get bigger because he is quadrupling the thing because the binder is,1
teacher:So we talked about different strategies right,1
teacher:Did we get 22,1
teacher:Yes sir,1
teacher:So if you have no idea how to do it sit down,1
teacher:You have no idea how to do it sit down,1
teacher:Three of your eight pieces in there;student:So I put,1
teacher:Okay so can a fifth work;student:Exact,1
teacher:If it doesnt fit,1
teacher:Okay but did it fit exactly,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:John,1
teacher:Do you see how I took that one step further,1
teacher:Does that makes sense,1
teacher:Do you see how great job do you see how physically he had to manipulate those,1
teacher:Olivia,1
teacher:You have a question,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:What do you need honey,1
teacher:My friends that can explain this stay standing,1
teacher:Okay do you understand why its so important that you have your fraction circles at school every day,1
teacher:Okay if you have no idea how to do this and I need honesty right now I need you to raise your hand,1
teacher:When you think you can explain to your partner how you could use your fraction pieces to find a sum I would like you to stand up,1
teacher:Stand up,1
teacher:And if you are kind of hanging around and not working on this other page I need honesty and I need you to stand up,1
teacher:Landon Why didnt you get to it,1
teacher:It has to be even  cause the only way I can cut a number in half is if its an even number right;student:It has to be even,1
teacher:Because I couldnt do it with 111th because half of 11 would be five and a half right,1
teacher:The same so if I understand equivalent fractions might I understand how to change the denominator so that theyre even;student:The same,1
teacher:But are they equivalent to each other;student:It either has to be equivalent or it has to like meet into each other like six and two,1
teacher:When you are done stand up please,1
teacher:When you are done stand up please,1
teacher:When you got them stand up,1
teacher:Eric what are you doing bud,1
teacher:Alyssa I need you to let them do the talking and then when I say can you add to it Okay,1
teacher:Sit down when youre done;student:Should we stand up when were done,1
teacher:What its doing is its adding it and is it bigger than a half,1
teacher:You have a question;student:Greater than,1
teacher:When you think you can explain it please stand up,1
teacher:I would like you to stand up,1
teacher:Stand up when you and your partner are done,1
teacher:Is that what youre asking me;student:One plus one equals,1
teacher:So you think its less than two Less than a half I mean,1
teacher:Do you know the easier way,1
teacher:Do you have everything you need,1
teacher:Three,1
teacher:Remember what you guys were talking about that you explained to me,1
teacher:Do you see how I did that,1
teacher:When I tweaked this did it make sense,1
teacher:So if I have fourth and a third correct,1
teacher:So I know that fourths doesnt work right,1
teacher:And I know that a third works but it still doesnt fill it all in right,1
teacher:Four sixths,1
teacher:Now I know I have to turn both of them into twelfths right,1
teacher:Are you done,1
teacher:Bump bada bump bump,1
teacher:Okay Zoe John come here;student:Bump bump,1
teacher:Less than a half,1
teacher:Is it gonna be between one and two,1
teacher:Do I expect you all the time to solve these with fraction circles,1
teacher:I want to know if you one your own know an easier way to do this Id like you to raise your hand,1
teacher:Are those there,1
teacher:Thats a fifth right,1
teacher:Stand when youre done,1
teacher:When youve got an answer stand up,1
teacher:What did you not understand,1
teacher:Im going to ask Michael,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:Stand up if you havent dont be embarrassed,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Is this making sense to both of you,1
teacher:Is this making sense to both of you;student:Yes,1
teacher:Is this making sense to both of you or not,1
teacher:And you both have this am I right,1
teacher:Do all three of you have this,1
teacher:When you and your partner are done stand up,1
teacher:I can do it this way no matter what raise your hand,1
teacher:But he has this and you have this am I right,1
teacher:Do you see what theyre doing,1
teacher:If you hadnt finished working on the first page please stand up;student:I only did 3,1
teacher:And can I break apart this way,1
teacher:Oh you think youve got it,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Thats one whole right,1
teacher:Now if I already broke apart one hole into fourths right,1
teacher:inauidble Is 11 fourths the exact same as 2 and 34ths;student:11,1
teacher:Do you see that,1
teacher:Does that make better sense,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:So can that really be five halves,1
teacher:Did I just model that;student:inauidble four fourths,1
teacher:do I have 14 yet,1
teacher:draw another circle;student:Draw another circle,1
teacher:You got it,1
teacher:You need some help,1
teacher:So you have to do So you have you would have doI just put a one there,1
teacher:If you have what you believe is an understanding of a four that I can do this by myself give me a four,1
teacher:is one and 75ths equal to four and two fifths,1
teacher:Yes sir,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:So those of you that were struggling with the picture do you see what she did,1
teacher:Did you draw a picture,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:Is one and 165th another name for 215ths,1
teacher:When youve got an answer stand up,1
teacher:Im going to ask you to turn and talk to your shoulder partner,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Im gonna have him go first,1
teacher:Pardon me,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:Was it from Alyssas discussion or what you were able to do,1
teacher:So can I break it into three,1
teacher:Can I broke it into four;student:Yes,1
teacher:Did you do it,1
teacher:Landon and Penelope come up,1
teacher:11 and three thirds;student:So I got so first I did 11 and 33rds,1
teacher:Its not;student:No,1
teacher:Did they take away a whole here and add it back in here,1
teacher:Is three and 75ths the exact same as four and two thirds only a different way to name it,1
teacher:It wont go in there but will 4 go into 30,1
teacher:because I have to break each mile into half and now I have one  So if these two friends and this one each get right,1
teacher:But really did they get a full mile;student:one and one fourth,1
teacher:How are you doing here buddy,1
teacher:Amy come over here,1
teacher:Why does it not make sense to you;student:It doesnt make sense to me,1
teacher:Yes sir,1
teacher:This ones gonna run inauidble so they each so far have a half a mile right;student:1234,1
teacher:So my division problem has to be Inaudible does that make sense,1
teacher:Does that make any more sense,1
teacher:Yes sir,1
teacher:Why do you say that,1
teacher:Do you see how I got that,1
teacher:Do you see how I got that,1
teacher:Can I look at a mixed number and join groups o make other groups,1
teacher:Who is done with the first page,1
teacher:So are you done with the first page,1
teacher:DO they have the same,1
teacher:Do moto and manny have the same amount of bananas,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:let me confuse you really good right;student:That would mean that  taken away,1
teacher:So if I have one five thats five fifths right,1
teacher:does that make better sense,1
teacher:So would it be 18;student:inauidble,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Are you sure,1
teacher:So if you finished all of page one and were truly working on the second page stand up,1
teacher:Yes friends,1
teacher:On which page,1
teacher:Does is anyone else stuck on 567,1
teacher:You got 567 youve got that right,1
teacher:Harmony are you doing okay or you need some help,1
teacher:What are you confused on;student:Im confused,1
teacher:Oh the next page;student:The next page,1
teacher:Alyssa do you get the next page,1
teacher:If you have a complete understanding five six and seven raise your hand,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:You see what we did,1
teacher:Christian and Michael does that make sense,1
teacher:They have to be the same right;student:equal,1
teacher:So is four a denominator of eight,1
teacher:Really,1
teacher:Ok does it mean you have 8  you know so you know that you have to to get the eight And then now can you subtract six eighths from there,1
teacher:I can,1
teacher:If I have,1
teacher:Okay so that being six,1
teacher:Austin go ahead,1
teacher:Okay so do you see how physically I would have done that;student:Three,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Youre doing the first one right;student:So if youre,1
teacher:Okay does that make sense;student:Okay,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:10,1
teacher:How far where are you,1
teacher:Stand when you are done,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Are you done,1
teacher:So you can put a decimal paths after we review this okay,1
teacher:Im sorry what,1
teacher:Raise hands  youve got your answer,1
teacher:Yep stand up when your done,1
teacher:Hey Jeff how are you,1
teacher:I have three of those correct,1
teacher:Theres my three tabs right,1
teacher:There is I was like that didnt work did it,1
teacher:up and down 10 boxes right,1
teacher:Have we done this before,1
teacher:correct,1
teacher:Im not going to get smaller am I,1
teacher:Notice I got rid of the nine 914 thousandths right,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:When youve writted that down stand up,1
teacher:So 15,1
teacher:Do you see why Its 15;student:Okay,1
teacher:Remember;student:Okay,1
teacher:Stand when youve got your answers,1
teacher:Did you go up and over across then up;student:Yes I started,1
teacher:So you went from the school to number six correct,1
teacher:Is that a route to the school,1
teacher:Blake do you have a shorter route,1
teacher:Can I go diagonal,1
teacher:Is that how you did it,1
teacher:Makes sense,1
teacher:Oh you know what though,1
teacher:Oh you know what;student:I went from the pizzeria and then went all the way out,1
teacher:Talk to me,1
teacher:Did you go up and then over,1
teacher:Went over and then up,1
teacher:So you miss counted right,1
teacher:Is it 10,1
teacher:Im sorry what;student:Because sometimes I cant hear you so I dont know,1
teacher:Stand up,1
teacher:When youve got an answer stand up,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:When you are done you may  you may turn your desk to work stand up if you are done,1
teacher:Remember,1
teacher:Are you done,1
teacher:What were you doing,1
teacher:Is that number bigger,1
teacher:Okay is that number five or more,1
teacher:Okay so that tells me that 3611 has to be  3613 3614 right,1
teacher:Does that make better sense,1
teacher:So you see how I did that,1
teacher:Are you done,1
teacher:Okay how many of you are struggling on the number one,1
teacher:So if I know when I round this nearest 100th my number becomes three and 5200 right,1
teacher:Do you see what Im doing here;student:so 425,1
teacher:So you all know what a coordinate grid is not new vocabulary but its the,1
teacher:Youve got to get the vocabulary right,1
teacher:I cant hear you,1
teacher:Does that help and make sense,1
teacher:Thats how you find a common denominator,1
teacher:Okay now I have 1 2 and 3 fourths right;student:Zachs helping us,1
teacher:Im keeping you here because what do you need,1
teacher:Is it going to be closest to one,1
teacher:Yes sir,1
teacher:Rob if youre done please stand,1
teacher:Jen are you done,1
teacher:Okay is two thirds bigger than a half;student:A half,1
teacher:Okay Julia,1
teacher:Do I have anything thats going to make a whole up there,1
teacher:A half;student:A half,1
teacher:Okay Emily,1
teacher:And third Michael,1
teacher:Michael what one are you solving,1
teacher:And you said it was closest to one,1
teacher:Or two,1
teacher:Okay so are they pretty close to a half at all being 18 and 110,1
teacher:Okay so would you like to change your answer,1
teacher:Is it going to be closest to a half,1
teacher:Stand when you are done,1
teacher:Is it going to be closest to zero,1
teacher:And coming up with different ways to rename a fraction okay,1
teacher:And six times two equals which is then I add because my denominator is now the same right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:But you got this,1
teacher:Is this making sense,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:So I have two thirds times one fourth so right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Three correct,1
teacher:Two thirds okay,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:Did you finish all of those,1
teacher:Will you grab my answer key,1
teacher:Because if I do a fifth and a fifth it doesnt fill it up does it,1
teacher:Our learning intention was I can use fraction circles to I can use fraction circles to create equivalent fractions to add fractions right,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:This does not say solve by itself does it,1
teacher:Stand when you are done,1
teacher:Davis Im gonna let you go first,1
teacher:Okay Evie,1
teacher:Yes love,1
teacher:Make sense;student:Ohhh,1
teacher:You see where I came up with 14th,1
teacher:Um Luke you done,1
teacher:Can I subtract,1
teacher:can I subtract one from three;student:Uh the one or,1
teacher:Gage how many problems do you have done before I answer your question,1
teacher:Haley what are you doing,1
teacher:Are you done,1
teacher:I can also make this an improper fraction cant I,1
teacher:So now I have two I have five fourths right;student:Five,1
teacher:Did I just confuse you belief,1
teacher:Okay so youre done Rob,1
teacher:Michael are you done,1
teacher:Zach I am going to are you good,1
teacher:See how it came out to be 36,1
teacher:Two;student:Times,1
teacher:You agreed,1
teacher:So remember our faction circles,1
teacher:Are you done,1
teacher:Chloe quickly turn and share with Julia,1
teacher:Elliot,1
teacher:We have to organize the problem first dont we,1
teacher:If its not then I have the wrong model right,1
teacher:Go ahead Luke go first,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Zach,1
teacher:Luke,1
teacher:AmyTell me w,1
teacher:Would that make a difference;student:And also might need a little more understanding,1
teacher:So do you see why I have them do that;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Yes sir,1
teacher:See,1
teacher:And then Alyssa are you done honey,1
teacher:Okay what were we stuck on,1
teacher:Thank you Go ahead Dan,1
teacher:Okay Miss Amy,1
teacher:I want you to come up with a strategy or rule okay,1
teacher:Did anybody miss both people miss both;student:Yes,1
teacher:Show me with your fingers,1
teacher:How you feel about comparing fractions,1
teacher:Are you trying to say that This actually has more than one,1
teacher:Does that make it easier to compare;student:Hundredths,1
teacher:And you figured that out Because you thought about the hundreds right,1
teacher:Oh and so when you think about 90 hundreds is like 90 pennies right;student:90 hundredths,1
teacher:Lionel,1
teacher:Could you say way less,1
teacher:did you guys finish number four,1
teacher:Are you sure about that,1
teacher:point nine,1
teacher:009,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Hollis how are you feeling about this,1
teacher:Do you feel like you understand why theyre not equivalent,1
teacher:Okay Liam or River go ahead River,1
teacher:why theyre not equal,1
teacher:So she found an equivalent fraction okay,1
teacher:Okay who wants to start,1
teacher:What do you think Hunter;student:Oh wait,1
teacher:Lionel,1
teacher:Would it be okay just to say four is less than 76,1
teacher:Once you think about that is it really four,1
teacher:Does everybody kind of feel like they understand that now,1
teacher:How are you guys doing,1
teacher:And this is similar to the example you showed right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Can you say that three tenths is less than 9500thss,1
teacher:Can you actually compare those numbers,1
teacher:Did you notice that MSkylerssa,1
teacher:Please hold it with your fingers how long you need to finish,1
teacher:so who wants to start,1
teacher:So are we saying Paulina used more with four tenths of a meter,1
teacher:Or Skyler use more with 56 hundredths of a meter,1
teacher:Emelia,1
teacher:Uh huh;student:Miss Tolliver,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Remember how thats when you pick a letter for the unknown,1
teacher:Is that what youre trying to say,1
teacher:Do you want to hear why,1
teacher:Can you try another method like traditional adding,1
teacher:So do you think you can use the traditional method of adding,1
teacher:And see what you come up with,1
teacher:Wait is that when you added and then subtract it from 900;student:Got 391,1
teacher:And then youre going to add the third one,1
teacher:Have you ever thought about adding all three together,1
teacher:In the traditional,1
teacher:Okay and then you subtracted;student:I think nearest 10,1
teacher:Can someone read number two out loud,1
teacher:Desmond can you read number two,1
teacher:Were you wondering what all those numbers were,1
teacher:Those are clue words right,1
teacher:Youre rounding,1
teacher:So maybe comparing your answer to your estimate and showing how close they are,1
teacher:Curtis,1
teacher:Arthur are you having a hard time;student:So Arthur can you please tell us what you got for your answer,1
teacher:Are you guys doing okay,1
teacher:Its what youre trying to solve,1
teacher:Can someone repeat what the directions will be in a small group what are you actually doing in a small group,1
teacher:You can read it out loud together but everybody try C on their own and then you compare okay,1
teacher:Anybody have any questions about that,1
teacher:That clue leftover,1
teacher:Lucille are you doing okay,1
teacher:Give me a thumbs up when you have your number model on Part C Margaret do you have your number model,1
teacher:Does it work to do it like that,1
teacher:Do you think that would give you your answer,1
teacher:Curtis,1
teacher:Okay so youre showing the actual process of adding;student:I added up all the customers through So I added 600 all the 100 150 all the tens and 23 for all the ones,1
teacher:Margaret,1
teacher:Is there another method,1
teacher:What Hunter,1
teacher:Does everybody agree with me,1
teacher:If you round to the nearest 100 did you get 800,1
teacher:Its 900 right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Could I say that four is less than 76,1
teacher:If I put in the chat box What if we did something like 03 Or no 04,1
teacher:Zach,1
teacher:Haley,1
teacher:Without a data point we cant answer that question can we,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:So it tells me when I posed the question to you the first time it was very easy to figure out right,1
teacher:So I have my stacky cubes here okay,1
teacher:Julia,1
teacher:Is that how I would get a data point;student:Four,1
teacher:And the two 59s;student:And the two 50s,1
teacher:Why did you did I only do six Ss;student:The four 57s and the two 54s,1
teacher:Why are you confused;student:I dont know,1
teacher:So when you say youre adding them all together are you just doing 53 54 55 56 57 59 60 61 62,1
teacher:So can I just pick two data points;student:Yep,1
teacher:So did I really only have 12 people that I measured yesterday Zach,1
teacher:Or no I mean nine people that I measured yesterday Zach,1
teacher:If you believe that the orangutan is smaller than a fifth grader stand,1
teacher:So my nine is not correct is it,1
teacher:Okay so you think hes taller than most;student:Since you said the smallest length of kid in our class was four foot five I thought  53 inches and you said the orangutan was 58 inches which is bigger,1
teacher:But you cant  decide can you,1
teacher:How many of you understood how to play it,1
teacher:Totally 100,1
teacher:Would you agree with that,1
teacher:Do you understand how he did that;student:So I got ninefifths,1
teacher:Please remember to stand or kneel when you are done,1
teacher:Stand or kneel when you are done,1
teacher:Austin what are you doing,1
teacher:Jonathan what are you doing,1
teacher:Could it be what you did,1
teacher:Calls could work as well did you decide say,1
teacher:Okay go ahead,1
teacher:About 33eighths;student:I got 33eighths,1
teacher:Thumbs  up,1
teacher:Got it,1
teacher:If you think the orangutan is close your eyes smaller raise your hand,1
teacher:If you believe this orangutan is taller than a fifth grader stand,1
teacher:Does that make sense now;student:I was dividing it by  nine too,1
teacher:Its not our average height is it,1
teacher:Is finding a data point lickitysplit easy,1
teacher:Oh Im sorry you and John were working together werent you;student:We think it would be taller,1
teacher:So now guess what,1
teacher:Oh and then just eliminated one of those right;student:I did 38 and a half plus 52 and a half,1
teacher:On your X,1
teacher:So do you see what he did,1
teacher:Is  Dan adding these numbers or are you doing all the work here;student:585 plus 49 ad 170 is No wait,1
teacher:Isnt multiplying easier,1
teacher:Will it work when repeated with any pair of decimals,1
teacher:So if we go back to our problem we want to know is it true because 95 is greater than three,1
teacher:Does it work to do it like that,1
teacher:Is it okay to compare 95 And three,1
teacher:Cooper what do you think,1
teacher:Did you mean 30 Hundredths,1
teacher:And then 9500ths,1
teacher:So how about this,1
teacher:Jaden,1
teacher:Go ahead John,1
teacher:Go ahead;student:Ill talk,1
teacher:Emily your group needs to go first,1
teacher:What are you confused about;student:Im still very confused,1
teacher:Makes sense;student:That makes sense now,1
teacher:So those of you that were rushing through this lickitysplit like you do it didnt make sense did it,1
teacher:Makes sense,1
teacher:And I want you to understand that each scale is written  in half inches correct,1
teacher:Jaden what  are you doing,1
teacher:Stand when youve got an answer,1
teacher:And we want to compare that to 076,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:In any of my directions over there did I multiply anything,1
teacher:Oh I did,1
teacher:Are your misconceptions about how to do that different now,1
teacher:So in the previous activity you calculated the typical height of a fifth grader right,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:I think it was both of them isnt that what I said;student:I think  were looking at  should we sit down,1
teacher:Okay when you and your partner have an answer go ahead and take a knee;student:So what do you guys think,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:The very first time I had you play exponent ball how many of you understood how to play it,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Are you still drawing circles,1
teacher:Were looking at half as a whole now right,1
teacher:Is two thirds bigger than a half,1
teacher:Ray I think you said yes at first right,1
teacher:Does this work,1
teacher:One half plus one fourth plus one fourth does it equal one,1
teacher:Did anybody show it wouldnt work with a picture,1
teacher:Do you guys see what he did with this picture;student:Thats basically what it says in my words here,1
teacher:Its greater than one and thats why it wont work right,1
teacher:Do you understand why that theirs wouldnt work;student:Yes,1
teacher:Does everyone understand if you were to take this whole piece of land this would be a fourth a fourth a fourth and a fourth and then these would be eighths,1
teacher:Do you guys see how Ray drew that,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:So guys theres a link to the Pear Deck in the chat if youre just getting Here are several links okay,1
teacher:And remember when I was teaching this to you we talked about kicking the other things out of the party right,1
teacher:So right now we talked about thinking about our thinking right,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Wait was I wrong in that last one,1
teacher:Daxton is that understanding,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Originally you said no or you said yes,1
teacher:Three thirds so a fourth would be bigger than the whole right,1
teacher:Do you agree Daxton,1
teacher:Do you see how the half becomes fourths,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Do you guys feel like you understand,1
teacher:Do you,1
teacher:On number one,1
teacher:Is it going to be more than one,1
teacher:You think its more now,1
teacher:Okay and would that equal that full part there,1
teacher:Does that work,1
teacher:What do you guys think,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:What do you guys think,1
teacher:No cuz 26 divided by two is 13 hours right,1
teacher:Want to see what you know,1
teacher:And theres no absolutely no risk with doing something wrong right now right,1
teacher:These are things that are bigger than six right,1
teacher:So it has to be flipped for that one because of what column its under right,1
teacher:Doing them backwards isnt as bad as not doing them at all right,1
teacher:Okay now can you find the slope and the y intercept from the picture,1
teacher:For slope we got to make some stairs right,1
teacher:It was the X of zero right,1
teacher:This one remember we had the alarms going on,1
teacher:Its like a new language that youre learning right,1
teacher:So these are ones that you just want to make sure that theyre not a guess right,1
teacher:taking the test you want to have that feeling now,1
teacher:before the test right,1
teacher:Now can you do it for an equation,1
teacher:Yeah range would mean ys right,1
teacher:Rate yourself,1
teacher:Where you at expert understand most of it understand some of it or dont understand,1
teacher:Guess what,1
teacher:Do you see a zero and a three with the x trapped in between,1
teacher:Do you see a zero and a three with the shading trapped in between,1
teacher:You know how to do this correctly,1
teacher:Go seven p minus two p which is five p I have five p minus four equals 11 now okay,1
teacher:Okay so those of you who made a mistake on that do you feel better about it,1
teacher:Then its something you and I are going to talk about during the help session okay;student:Not really,1
teacher:Remember were just shooting some baskets are throwing some passes right,1
teacher:So rate yourself,1
teacher:Where are you four,1
teacher:expert,1
teacher:I want know who said no,1
teacher:Three understand most of it two understand some of it or one you are totally lost,1
teacher:This unit is all about Its basically unit one again its the exact same stuff except we replace equal signs with alligators right,1
teacher:And you had to think about whether to shade to the right or the left right,1
teacher:Okay have that metacognition moment in your head where youre thinking like Do I understand this,1
teacher:Do I need help on this,1
teacher:What parts of that are confusing what parts of that are easy,1
teacher:We know that now we are going to have a closed dot right,1
teacher:Okay so remember we talked about small medium large small medium large right,1
teacher:So what are you going to feel,1
teacher:So anyone need more time,1
teacher:I want to know who said yes,1
teacher:Does it say how much more,1
teacher:What are we looking at next,1
teacher:Gordon what are we looking at next,1
teacher:Did anyone get an answer yet,1
teacher:Lacey did you get an answer,1
teacher:Do you think itll work just to put those in fifths,1
teacher:So four students to the Forest Preserve sharing three pizzas we said was three fourths right,1
teacher:And we got four fifths right,1
teacher:Is anything else close to seven eighths,1
teacher:Well what about four fifths,1
teacher:Frankie isnt fourth fifth close to a whole,1
teacher:Frankie,1
teacher:Lacey,1
teacher:Lacey,1
teacher:Gordon,1
teacher:How are you guys doing;student:He was the last question,1
teacher:Okay whats the next one were looking at,1
teacher:Ramsey,1
teacher:You did;student:I had the same idea,1
teacher:Hey guys which one are you on,1
teacher:But heres where youre actually answering the question right,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions,1
teacher:Liam do you have a question,1
teacher:Oh and theres not five people right;student:I accidentally divided the river by five,1
teacher:So for that one we know theyre going to get three fourths right,1
teacher:Hows it going;student:Okay so in the corner,1
teacher:Okay and where have you gotten so far;student:Sure,1
teacher:Okay and where you have the three pizzas and how many people are sharing those three pizzas;student:Um were on to question one right now,1
teacher:Well we say one half and one fourth,1
teacher:Ramsey,1
teacher:Hunter did you figure it out,1
teacher:But both ways you get three fourths right,1
teacher:Okay whats the next one,1
teacher:Because theres five students right,1
teacher:Go ahead Lacey,1
teacher:Remember how we talked about a half and the whole,1
teacher:So Im going to come back and I want you guys to talk about that,1
teacher:Hey guys hows it going;student:Okay so,1
teacher:Mariana,1
teacher:Kenna,1
teacher:Can I have Grant,1
teacher:Did anybody else multiply instead of just adding up,1
teacher:Marie come on up,1
teacher:Does that work,1
teacher:Does that seem fair,1
teacher:If youre not the oldest does it seem fair,1
teacher:Can she do it,1
teacher:Is it possible,1
teacher:Is it not,1
teacher:Ray do you have a question,1
teacher:Yeah it sounds like the sisters might go to war because you know what,1
teacher:Can she do it,1
teacher:Is that really important,1
teacher:But now you actually have to show your reasoning right,1
teacher:Thumbs up if you had something really similar to that,1
teacher:It might look like its close to one but is it,1
teacher:Lacy,1
teacher:Well can I ask you something first,1
teacher:Did you guys get these same four fractions,1
teacher:Did you get three fourths seven eighths four fifths and three fifths,1
teacher:Why do you Oh Liam go ahead,1
teacher:Like look when I color and actually seven of those out of the eight is that pretty close,1
teacher:Does everybody think that that makes sense,1
teacher:Does that make sense boys and girls,1
teacher:Thumb up if you have something on your paper for number one,1
teacher:Hey Mariana how are you guys doing;student:Yes,1
teacher:If I look at three fourths do you see how theres a big piece still here,1
teacher:Do you see the difference in the two,1
teacher:Do you see why seven eights would be bigger,1
teacher:Parker,1
teacher:Does that kind of make sense,1
teacher:Thumb up if you got four fifths for the farmers cornfield,1
teacher:Thumb up if you got seven eighths,1
teacher:Yes Parker,1
teacher:The people that did not stand up when I said If your answers were the same did at least one of you have the right answer,1
teacher:Now listen if youre not 100 confident  because  I believe you all know how to do it but are you 100 confident,1
teacher:Did you do that,1
teacher:Next row who needs help,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Once you know it give me a thumbs up,1
teacher:Once you know it give me a thumbs up,1
teacher:Because four fourths is full Michael does that make sense,1
teacher:Noah does that make sense,1
teacher:What are you confused about,1
teacher:Did you label it,1
teacher:So weve labeled our blank tick marks havent we,1
teacher:What;student:Um I wrote 1 by 1,1
teacher:Do you understand how I got that number,1
teacher:When you finish those two pages stand up,1
teacher:Put your finger on your nose when youre done,1
teacher:Go ahead Michael,1
teacher:Now do you see where he got his threesixteenths,1
teacher:Anyone,1
teacher:Charlotte,1
teacher:Who needs help in the back row,1
teacher:I need to clear the front of the room so that I can work with my friends that dont get their  okay,1
teacher:Twothirds is bigger than fourninths right;student:Because twothirds is bigger than fourninths,1
teacher:The pieces were bigger than the ninths right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Aaron,1
teacher:Im sorry what;student:Um so I thought we,1
teacher:Two of those sorr do they represent the problem exactly,1
teacher:Or do they only represent it showing two of the thirds shaded,1
teacher:So they didnt do both of them right;student:They only represent showing two,1
teacher:Because it does represent both right,1
teacher:But if I break that into ninths if I label it one ninth two ninths I dont have enough ninths do I,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Haley,1
teacher:So Haley jumped up and said Oh well the dimensions of the shaded are its two thirds here and two thirds here do you understand why you couldnt write one third one third one third one third,1
teacher:If you are onehundred percent sure you understand this stand up,1
teacher:Who was standing up back there,1
teacher:Austin,1
teacher:Mason,1
teacher:Do you see where he got his three sixteenths,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Show them to your neighbor,1
teacher:Show them to your neighbors,1
teacher:Mason,1
teacher:Did you work hard to try and solve this problem,1
teacher:What;student:No,1
teacher:If youre working hard youre not doing bad selftalk are you,1
teacher:Youve got all of that part right correct,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Okay do that make sense,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Hey turn and show your neighbor,1
teacher:Did you get to check yours,1
teacher:Okay Im going to start with Connor,1
teacher:Okay Im going to ask Dan;student:I did five tenths and then he did six tenths,1
teacher:So notice what it says here,1
teacher:Do you agree with that,1
teacher:X Y okay,1
teacher:You still have the same numbers right,1
teacher:Will do you see where he got it,1
teacher:No you dont;student:I,1
teacher:When youre done put your hand on your head;student:Its the same,1
teacher:Hand on your head when youre done,1
teacher:But you have to use US traditional to solve them okay;student:Okay,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:When youve completed all of those stand up,1
teacher:You believe that its less than correct;student:Yes,1
teacher:When youve completed all of three stand up,1
teacher:So one fourth right;student:Um no yeah,1
teacher:Right here,1
teacher:Do you all have that,1
teacher:Because I have one third two thirds right,1
teacher:See where you made your mistake,1
teacher:Sorry what;student:I accidentally,1
teacher:So you did two fourths by two thirds,1
teacher:Right here;student:Um,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Charlotte,1
teacher:Thumbs up greater,1
teacher:So you have blank times onefourth right,1
teacher:Does it make sense,1
teacher:Im sorry what,1
teacher:So do I have to come up with some kind of common denominator,1
teacher:But would it be 4 remainder 1;student:13 is stupid,1
teacher:I want you to tell me if that works;student:Because you have 2 and then,1
teacher:8 and 23 is what you think it is right,1
teacher:Zach Bomp ba da bomp bomp,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:Did anybody else get an answer,1
teacher:What I multiplied this one by or divided it by I have to do to the top one right,1
teacher:Because whatever rule I implement with my denominator I have to implement with me numerator right,1
teacher:Did I have to divide 3 times 13 or divide 13;student:We had to divide 3 times 13,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Did I come out with 4 remainder 1,1
teacher:Did you finish problems three and four,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:When you are done youre going to stand up from wherever you are,1
teacher:I didnt have the answer right off the bat did I,1
teacher:Give me a thumbs up if you are 100 sure that that is a strategy rule you could use,1
teacher:Go to the side if youre not sure,1
teacher:Go to the side if youre not sure,1
teacher:Okay Miss Julia Mr Zach explain to me the rule that you thought you could use for the second one and I want everyone to listen and remember my friend youre going to teach your new thinking okay,1
teacher:So go ahead,1
teacher:Did you have another strategy,1
teacher:So can you try that and tell me if it works;student:And then you would times 15 by the answer of what you got of 5 divided by 3 or 3 divided by 5,1
teacher:Okay so we know we cant do 2 can we,1
teacher:1 and 23 okay;student:I dont think what Oh,1
teacher:So if I go in with 15 can I come out with 15,1
teacher:I love the fact What words did you just use,1
teacher:Do you have a better understanding now,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:So because can I really have 45 pieces in 15,1
teacher:So do you understand why it was not the right way to do it,1
teacher:Yes sir,1
teacher:Does that make more sense,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:Should you have 26 lines;student:I have 26 lines,1
teacher:Um Austin,1
teacher:I need a fist if its true highfive if its false,1
teacher:Five if its false,1
teacher:Fist if its true highfive if its false,1
teacher:If you believe that Five in twohundred and eightynine thousandths is less than five and threetenths stay standing,1
teacher:If you disagree sit down,1
teacher:Stand when youre done;student:Can you solve it,1
teacher:This way;student:I did it the um,1
teacher:Like that Mr Ethan;student:And then I color two in,1
teacher:Like this,1
teacher:Like this,1
teacher:I have nine boxes right,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:If you think its greater than I want a thumbs up,1
teacher:If you think its less than I want a thumbs down,1
teacher:If you believe its false give me a fist,1
teacher:If you believe this is true give me a five,1
teacher:Will,1
teacher:Hands on your head when you are done,1
teacher:Whichever way is easiest to do this does it come out to be the same every single time,1
teacher:But in your head youve made these work right,1
teacher:How you doing my love,1
teacher:But is that really the right answer,1
teacher:Okay so help me Are you guys going to do this;student:In the classroom theres four steps,1
teacher:All right so if I use the division strategy and I got 20 times 58 right,1
teacher:I know that 5 times 2 is 10 right;student:She used 45 of it and to tie a bow on a large gift how much ribbon does she use,1
teacher:Thumbs down less,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:So remember what we did,1
teacher:You know what,1
teacher:Did we use an area model yesterday,1
teacher:That is understanding an area model okay,1
teacher:Remember I showed you the easy way to do this yesterday didnt I,1
teacher:So two fifths 1 2 3 4 5 they colored in two of those fifths right,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Yeah;student:Miss,1
teacher:Do you all feel confident at playing the game;student:Yes,1
teacher:Does it then help you explain why you missed the next one,1
teacher:Okay yes Maam;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:Okay buddy go ahead,1
teacher:Okay but did you answer the questions of is it greater than leS than did you do any of those;student:And then you get three times two equals six,1
teacher:And then yes it is greater than two thirds,1
teacher:Go ahead Ben,1
teacher:No;student:I see what youre saying,1
teacher:So are you being attentive math S;student:Because,1
teacher:Are you being attentive math S,1
teacher:Are you being a good audience,1
teacher:Are you being a good community member,1
teacher:Weve seen a couple of different examples havent we,1
teacher:You are going to in your partnership have two different sheets of paper okay,1
teacher:You have to be able to say well I can tell by looking at number one that it goes with A here okay,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:Any questions;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:Yes man,1
teacher:When your group is done stand up,1
teacher:What;student:Were sharing,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Go ahead Dan and Emily,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Dan,1
teacher:MiS Isaac you are up,1
teacher:Oh Ben;student:No thats Ben,1
teacher:Sometimes my math has to be really quick do I have enough kids to do equal groups,1
teacher:Oh I know what I need to do I would like you and your partner are we ready,1
teacher:Okay go ahead,1
teacher:So talk it out before you write it;student:So if you were at a supermarket,1
teacher:Talk it out before you write it,1
teacher:Okay so they gave the answer didnt they,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Read the question again Matt;student:Hey Matt can you read the question,1
teacher:Go ahead;student:Jimmy Jonathon feet of fencing one way and eight feet the other way how much area of fencing does he have in total,1
teacher:Go ahead youre up,1
teacher:Go ahead next up,1
teacher:How we doing,1
teacher:So are you going to write a story problem about that one,1
teacher:Maybe;student:Maybe,1
teacher:Was it difficult to think about that;student:Yes,1
teacher:Stand when youre done,1
teacher:So much easier moving to the right or the left isnt it,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:So it would have been point three;student:Well the decimal point starts at the very the first number,1
teacher:So my note will look like this;student:Four,1
teacher:Is that what it should look like,1
teacher:Thats what youre telling me,1
teacher:You and I still have the same things dont we,1
teacher:And by showing her that do you understand  why you did it wrong,1
teacher:Do you all understand that,1
teacher:Did I have to solve that to look at it to figure it out;student:Yes,1
teacher:So you know what Im thinking,1
teacher:Do you see how to play this,1
teacher:Did you score,1
teacher:But is that smaller than that,1
teacher:Please stand when you are done,1
teacher:And stand when you are done,1
teacher:Does it  work for you just to tell the person what you want them to type in,1
teacher:Thats all this is about okay;student:Okay,1
teacher:Hey friends do you need me,1
teacher:Okay what are you confused about;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Does that make sense;student:Yeah I see now,1
teacher:This one was a harder one so I wouldnt write a number story about that one would I;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Yes darling,1
teacher:And we have six dots two of the thirds are colored in every one agree,1
teacher:Makes sense,1
teacher:Every one agreeing we have two thirds and,1
teacher:What is confusing;student:We dont know if its just confusing,1
teacher:You dont understand how it came out to be five eighths;student:The five eighths,1
teacher:Or are you talking about writing a number story,1
teacher:Can you turn it into a fraction that looks like this,1
teacher:Can I divide masks;student:Masks,1
teacher:Is that the only food would divide,1
teacher:Were you able to use the charts and look at the number sentence and the visual models and connect them,1
teacher:But together youre writing the number stories okay,1
teacher:But Ive got to keep the numbers in front of it because if not I change the value of the number dont I,1
teacher:Do you normally work with Connor,1
teacher:Michael go ahead buddy Im going to let you go and tell us,1
teacher:Did I give specific instructions not to use that method on your paper or you could write it but there had to be an explanation of another;student:Because everybody knows how to do that and you want us to be able to understand how to do the other methods,1
teacher:Were those my instructions;student:Yes,1
teacher:How you doing friend,1
teacher:How you doing friend,1
teacher:Oh but did you answer this one,1
teacher:What is the problem,1
teacher:Tell me what the problem is,1
teacher:Three fourths minus one third;student:It is three fourths minus one,1
teacher:So I already know that I have to turn it into twelves right,1
teacher:Do you see what Im doing,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:Matt,1
teacher:Show;student:To show,1
teacher:Break it down find it out;student:Like kind of break it down and find it out,1
teacher:Break it down to be able to understand how to solve it okay,1
teacher:Go ahead Izzy,1
teacher:Were going to skip the first part of this okay,1
teacher:Okay can I ask a question;student:About the folding method,1
teacher:Did you guys write something down for number one on journal page 178;student:What do you mean,1
teacher:And Im going to ask Austin to start,1
teacher:How are you doing girl;student:No its not,1
teacher:If you do not write them correctly you get the same answer right,1
teacher:And now I would like Mr Austin to come up here,1
teacher:Mr Austin would you please,1
teacher:Makes sense,1
teacher:Youve got to remember when you are talking about grids using coordinates they have to follow the same rule dont they,1
teacher:Is it ever going to change the outcome of the answer,1
teacher:Am I correct,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Okay what are we working on friends;student:One method we discussed in class was,1
teacher:Haley,1
teacher:Did you complete number one;student:Yeah,1
teacher:About the what;student:Yes we are writing for the method for multiplying fractions discovered in class and were writing about paper folding,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:When youve answered both of those and if youre shading it I should see how it encompasses two different things or how it just encompasses the answer okay,1
teacher:So if you use the paperfolding way when we shaded one way then we shaded it another color or if youre just using the area model where it shows the onethird of twofifths okay,1
teacher:I would say Im going to ask you to leave that and move on to the next  okay;student:So two plus three is five and,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Oh the order of operations;student:Okay so do you know the order that you do the,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:So if Im doing a fraction of a whole am I going to come out with a whole number;student:Because on our sheets of paper its like a fraction times a fraction,1
teacher:Does that help answer it,1
teacher:So Im going to ask was this interpreting a model,1
teacher:How many of you would say fist to five five being This made perfect sense to I was a little confused zero Friend I have no idea what this was even asking me,1
teacher:Show me fist to five,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Would you share a pizza,1
teacher:Would you carpet a room;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Would you buy cookies to share;student:No,1
teacher:Stand when you are done,1
teacher:Is it going to change,1
teacher:Im going to ask you to leave what you have here stop  do your math boxes okay,1
teacher:Does that help;student:it would be eighttwelfths,1
teacher:Thats not what the pictures telling me here is it,1
teacher:Do I see 1212 that group A couldve took,1
teacher:Who called me;student:Ms,1
teacher:Yes maam;student:Me,1
teacher:When you and your partner are done please return to your seats,1
teacher:Okay everybody done sharing;student:This is,1
teacher:And then did you explain that the total rectangle was divided into 15 equal pieces,1
teacher:So right now theres fourtwelfths  right;student:Okay,1
teacher:Did you figure it out Mason;student:So,1
teacher:Yes because thats exactly you multiply acroS it comes out to be three eights my pieces get smaller dont they;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Yes;student:T,1
teacher:Yes;student:T,1
teacher:How we doing boys;student:So its  a pattern that  so,1
teacher:What are you confused about,1
teacher:Is there something that I can help you with,1
teacher:Hey what are you confused about guys;student:Busted,1
teacher:1212 minus 912;student:The first one,1
teacher:Are those your numbers there;student:So I put that,1
teacher:Just the questions you get on this one okay,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:If you have the mixed number stand,1
teacher:Stand when you are done please,1
teacher:Did you get 1410,1
teacher:See why you have to show your work,1
teacher:Were you are afraid to divide because this looks so big,1
teacher:Divide by one;student:I didnt know that we were supposed to divide by 365 so I divided by one,1
teacher:Well if you divide by one itll still be 9855 right,1
teacher:Does my answer make sense,1
teacher:Does my answer make sense,1
teacher:If we answered Ivans been in the enclosure for 27 years does that make sense,1
teacher:Dont be afraid to try the math just because you think its going to be hard right;student:So I  know  but I tried addition because I knew  and I know thats wrong but I was going to try,1
teacher:Gosh  thats not going to work right,1
teacher:So I think about so Ivan was in his cell or his domain and lets say he had a marker and he was keeping tally of every day hes been in there right,1
teacher:That was my thinking right,1
teacher:And when I thought of that word group that was my clue about what I needed to do right,1
teacher:Yesterday we were making groups of oranges right,1
teacher:Oh we need to divide  right,1
teacher:The thing here,1
teacher:You with me,1
teacher:Did you get your subtraction,1
teacher:So I have 1410 minus 1095 right,1
teacher:Does that work,1
teacher:Because we know he came to the domain when he was young right,1
teacher:So we think about the average age of a human right,1
teacher:So if our answer doesnt make sense to match that thinking its not a good answer right,1
teacher:365 days right;student:Probably like,1
teacher:So dont we want to put these into groups of 365,1
teacher:Now I said this is going to be tricky right,1
teacher:Because I have not taught you how to do my big numbers like this right,1
teacher:But I bet we could figure it out right;student:We dont even know how to get 365,1
teacher:We know 365 times 10 is   right,1
teacher:Does that help me out,1
teacher:Could I do that again,1
teacher:Okay now can I do another 3650,1
teacher:315  years;student:I got 25,1
teacher:Is that what that is,1
teacher:Thats what I have here right,1
teacher:Dont forget to ask yourself that question Does my answer make sense,1
teacher:27;student:I divided and,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:Chloe;student:I think  bottom ones a little bit off because they didnt really have those numbers on he paper so  I dont think you should use multiple,1
teacher:Show me some thumbs how do you feel about this equation right here,1
teacher:Just drawing it drawing it helps you make it easy;student:Just drawing it,1
teacher:Ella,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:Uhuh  Carrie;student:2x6,1
teacher:Chloe,1
teacher:We could also do right,1
teacher:Is that the same,1
teacher:So he did yeah,1
teacher:Does this represent the soda that were adding,1
teacher:Julia,1
teacher:Anybody have another equation Carrie;student:And it equals three fourths,1
teacher:Is our process similar to what we were doing when we were thinking about the flowers in the vase,1
teacher:Carrie,1
teacher:Carrie;student:Its three multiple of four,1
teacher:So you drew a vase and four flowers in each one;student:I actually drew flowers and a vase,1
teacher:Three circles,1
teacher:Keep telling me Ella,1
teacher:Packs of four she goes to the grocery store shes standing  in the aisle with all the water bottles right,1
teacher:You can picture this right,1
teacher:Repeated addition right,1
teacher:But shes doing that as shes putting them in the cart right,1
teacher:Piper,1
teacher:Four times 30;student:We can do  four times 30,1
teacher:Too big right,1
teacher:Does 3000 makes sense;student:No,1
teacher:Four times 20,1
teacher:120 is too much right;student:I thought it would be easier if I did 120 but it didnt really work,1
teacher:Shes going to buy just less than  30 right,1
teacher:Matteo,1
teacher:Hes probably doing something to keep track right,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Do you see something,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:Were you talking about writing it over here,1
teacher:Do we know how to multiply a fraction number;student:Fraction,1
teacher:So if your answer was over  100 does it make sense;student:Okay,1
teacher:Is our answer going to make sense,1
teacher:Ferogio  its been a while since Ive talked to you,1
teacher:70 plus 70;student:So for perimeter I did 50 plus 50 and then after that 70 plus 70,1
teacher:Does that need to change your math then;student:Yeah same,1
teacher:Is perimeter squared;student:Squared,1
teacher:Feels good,1
teacher:Okay show me  thumbs,1
teacher:Im sorry what;student:Can you mute David,1
teacher:Miguel,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:Carrie;student:Because if I get the number then I still need to do and then divide that 13 then I,1
teacher:How many more calories I need to meet my goal right,1
teacher:Did you already subtract,1
teacher:You got to start by writing it down first right,1
teacher:Chloe did you finish it,1
teacher:You did  not trade right;student:You have to trade,1
teacher:You know what to do;student:I know what to do,1
teacher:If I have zero can I take six,1
teacher:Okay so now that we know our height could we figure out our perimeter,1
teacher:Is this an honest mistake,1
teacher:Division right,1
teacher:Yeah its a turn around batch right;student:Six,1
teacher:What do we think,1
teacher:Did I get an area,1
teacher:Did I give you an area,1
teacher:Did I give you any other information,1
teacher:Can you solve it,1
teacher:Can you find the height and the perimeter,1
teacher:Do me a  favor check in with your neighbor,1
teacher:Did you  check in with your neighbor,1
teacher:Did you check in with Emily,1
teacher:What I was trying to get you to identify Avery is that you sue the area formula right;student:Perimeter is 50 inches  inches is the area  so if you do some very very simple problem like multiplication  if you can divide,1
teacher:Okay you said 70,1
teacher:Do we need that extra zero,1
teacher:So should it be 70,1
teacher:Looking at my math though does 70 make sense,1
teacher:Diego,1
teacher:So one day at a time right,1
teacher:You just pulling a number out,1
teacher:The kids brought him all the oranges right,1
teacher:You following,1
teacher:Chloe,1
teacher:So before Oscar  can do these he has to gather up all of the oranges right,1
teacher:Do we know how many oranges he has,1
teacher:I wouldnt want to multiply that right,1
teacher:We want to know how many piles of five right,1
teacher:Does that make sense;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:Okay are we good,1
teacher:So definitely a challenge problem right,1
teacher:Do you think multiplication would solve this problem,1
teacher:Do you think this will solve our problem,1
teacher:Is that what we want to figure it out,1
teacher:Are you willing to try something different;student:Division,1
teacher:So I like that Julia is asking the question does it make sense,1
teacher:So three kids come and they bring all of their oranges to Oscar right,1
teacher:A basket full of fruit right;student:A basket of fruit,1
teacher:Is it doable,1
teacher:So I can subtract that right,1
teacher:Carrie,1
teacher:Thats going to get me started right,1
teacher:We could just add zeros to those right,1
teacher:Make them bigger,1
teacher:So Im thinking I want to just start with this 39 right,1
teacher:That gets me pretty close huh,1
teacher:Chloe can I do two minus nine,1
teacher:Over a hundred years,1
teacher:13 times 20;student:13 times 20,1
teacher:Seven,1
teacher:Thats with a remainder of seven,1
teacher:Yeah;student:Yeah,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:If I aim to burn 330 I will Because if I round down and only do 329 Im going to miss my goal by this much right;student:Or you can just burn 330,1
teacher:I can totally do that right,1
teacher:660;student:If thats so easy how about 660,1
teacher:Now we could do 13 times three right;student:Oh my god its going to be too big,1
teacher:Did I figure it all out,1
teacher:Chloe,1
teacher:Yeah;student:I have a question,1
teacher:Carrie,1
teacher:When we multiply them together we get a square number right,1
teacher:Factor right;student:Factor,1
teacher:So yesterday we were talking area model right,1
teacher:So we definitely looked at a three by three array right,1
teacher:Factor times a factor equals a product right,1
teacher:Do you remember that,1
teacher:What we did is we just kind of boxed it up and we counted right,1
teacher:Now were going to start to take things further okay,1
teacher:Can you still make that connection of how many dots are inside there,1
teacher:We still have an array we just took part of it away right,1
teacher:Are you following me,1
teacher:Well yeah but you should be writing the examples down on your paper right;student:Do we still write that on our paper,1
teacher:This is a five by five right,1
teacher:But I would have dots right,1
teacher:These are all square numbers right Ben;student:We have square numbers 1 4 9 16 25 36 49,1
teacher:But we could count the tiny little boxes in there right,1
teacher:Very very different answer than what was being asked right,1
teacher:You have to think about what its asking you right;student:You have to think about the subtraction and actually the addition,1
teacher:Its not typically how we write a year right;student:Thats not really a year,1
teacher:And this would say that I was born in the year nine,1
teacher:I mean I guess we could have traveled back in time but these seem kind of unrealistic right;student:Unless you time traveled,1
teacher:Probably right;student:so big that the earth would be,1
teacher:Is that fact,1
teacher:Pretty typical for people right,1
teacher:Does this number have anything to do with my problem,1
teacher:I obviously this right,1
teacher:What;student:Also the year were in right now,1
teacher:Julia,1
teacher:So if I take the year now and subtract the number of years Ive been alive that will tell me when I was born;student:Because its the year were in now and if you subtract it you can get to places you want for the year,1
teacher:Yeah subtraction right;student:And besides that sort of states taking away,1
teacher:Since then it has been 41 years right,1
teacher:Does 2012 makes sense,1
teacher:Can I take from here,1
teacher:If you were doing that 365 times 41 you are calculating how many days Ive been alive right,1
teacher:Five right;student:Five,1
teacher:Did I have to count back,1
teacher:Did I have to count boxes;student:No,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:It might be easier it might be faster but either way you got the same answer right;student:But either way you got the same answer,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Okay are you ready,1
teacher:Are you sure;student:Yes,1
teacher:We have not spent years learning to count by fours or learning to count by sixes right,1
teacher:You used the same one;student:I used the same one,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:And I saw you you were writing things down werent you,1
teacher:Especially when we come to something like four times six that were not used to counting by right,1
teacher:Do you see how I counted them out,1
teacher:I drew a five by eight,1
teacher:So Carrie took something she knew right,1
teacher:How are we feeling,1
teacher:These are very very similar to what we did but they took away the boxes right,1
teacher:If we count by twos count by twos with me,1
teacher:Is there a right way or wrong way,1
teacher:So because we have 10 versus two so we could count by twos all the way through 10 right,1
teacher:So you did like that,1
teacher:I need to count the squares or the dot inside my room right,1
teacher:In order to find the area thats inside we know were going to take the column times the rows right,1
teacher:Column times rows gives me area right,1
teacher:We might also say length times width will give me the area right,1
teacher:Is this the length of my shape,1
teacher:And the width of my shape,1
teacher:I want to know how many dots or how many squares are in fabulous shape right,1
teacher:Any other answers before we talk about this problem,1
teacher:Did everybody match with one of the strategies that was up there,1
teacher:Whichever way you did it you should come up with the same answer right,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:But Im only 20 years old so I guess it really isnt that long right,1
teacher:All right lets try a different one are you ready,1
teacher:Its a two by seven right,1
teacher:You ready,1
teacher:You made squares;student:I made squares,1
teacher:We can look at this as five groups of seven like Chloe did right,1
teacher:Anybody else;student:But then when you wrote it down you had a similar to what the question was asking so I couldnt really understand what it was,1
teacher:This is what were looking for right,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Do you see how  weve got for an equation and weve got multiplication,1
teacher:You following me,1
teacher:Caleb,1
teacher:Look at all the hands Lilliana,1
teacher:Questions about that,1
teacher:Carrie,1
teacher:Remember,1
teacher:Decomposing is to break down right,1
teacher:Do you remember,1
teacher:You ready to break down fivesixths,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Does that also work;student:I did threesixths plus twosixths,1
teacher:Okay but were decomposing remember;student:Fivesixths equals onesixth times five,1
teacher:Fivesixths which would really be the same as this right,1
teacher:Do we need another minute to look at that sixeighths or do we have that finished too,1
teacher:Pretty easy recipe right,1
teacher:Show me fingers if you need another minute;student:I got that done,1
teacher:You sure,1
teacher:Is there another equation she could use William;student:I got it right,1
teacher:All right here we go are you ready;student:What if the common denominator,1
teacher:Do we know;student:Probably a dozen or more,1
teacher:Florist has five bunches does it matter how many flowers are in each bunch,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you have an  answer for the water,1
teacher:You have a different answer,1
teacher:Not going to share huh,1
teacher:Matteo;student:I got five cups,1
teacher:What;student:I dont know,1
teacher:Matteo,1
teacher:Are we talking about food coloring right now,1
teacher:Talk to your neighbor,1
teacher:It was an easy conversation,1
teacher:Nobodys showing me then we dont need any time,1
teacher:Youre understanding what she did right,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:Question;student:Because I knew it wouldnt just be two numbers by itself and,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Eight;student:Eight,1
teacher:was your hand up,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:If you have an answer  I want you to stand up and do 20 jumping jacks;student:How many teaspoons of salt,1
teacher:Are we ready,1
teacher:It would  be like this right,1
teacher:You went and just multiplied the wrong part huh,1
teacher:Yeah;student:Thats what I got,1
teacher:Feeling good,1
teacher:Oh some impropers happening huh;student:Thats an improper,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Once you think you have an answer for that youre going to do 30 jumping jacks,1
teacher:Owen,1
teacher:We got this right,1
teacher:if we decompose we get this right;student:Its improper,1
teacher:Chloe,1
teacher:Are we ready,1
teacher:Questions about anything we did here;student:Yes,1
teacher:Are we ready to keep going,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Remember now,1
teacher:Give me a thumbs up if you remember how to decompose a fraction,1
teacher:Is there enough water for everyone,1
teacher:Is there enough water for everyone,1
teacher:Is there enough water for everyone,1
teacher:How much water are we going to need right;student:I think you need to figure out how many water youre going to need,1
teacher:Did you figure it out already;student:Onefourth times nine,1
teacher:Know your plan,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Five wholes;student:Theres going to be five wholes,1
teacher:Fourfourths is a whole right,1
teacher:Plus can I get another fourfourths;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:Two wholes right;student:Two and onefourth,1
teacher:So  is there enough water for everyone;student:Because theres two cups in one pint and two pints in one quart,1
teacher:Yes and we can explain it right;student:Yes,1
teacher:Or I could multiply and we know the trick for multiplying right,1
teacher:Multiplication is a lot like addition all right,1
teacher:That;student:Six plus six five plus five,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:I didnt change my amount at all did I,1
teacher:Its getting bigger right;student:Getting bigger,1
teacher:We just cut the pieces again right,1
teacher:We just added two slices;student:We just added two,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:We took two pieces and we made them smaller right,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:You hear what shes saying,1
teacher:Shes like hey I used addition and multiplication because I can multiply because this is counting by twos right,1
teacher:Two times two right;student:Two times two,1
teacher:Are you hearing whats happening here,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:Is there a cheat we could use to get to this fraction,1
teacher:Did we double,1
teacher:Did we double;student:Oh I see,1
teacher:Miguel,1
teacher:Did we double,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Same right,1
teacher:Are we done here,1
teacher:So if we eat 48 eggs each month weve got 48 in January 48 in February 48 in March right,1
teacher:You following me,1
teacher:Okay you ready,1
teacher:Am I right so far,1
teacher:Does anybody agree with me,1
teacher:Yeah;student:Yes,1
teacher:So that means up here where I had my eggs I need to do 576 plus 576 right;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Anybody else,1
teacher:Equal a thing;student:equal a thing,1
teacher:Equal fractions;student:Equal fractions,1
teacher:Julia,1
teacher:Okay so two fourths would be the same as one half,1
teacher:Youd cut each of the pieces in half;student:Put a line in like this,1
teacher:Do you agree,1
teacher:Penelope,1
teacher:Anybody,1
teacher:Miguel,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Three ninths;student:And by one,1
teacher:Penelope,1
teacher:Penelope,1
teacher:Two eighths;student:Two eighths,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Oh that works pretty good right;student:100 300,1
teacher:Could we use any number,1
teacher:Are we using pictures anymore,1
teacher:You did;student:Ive got something,1
teacher:Times two;student:Times two,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:You multiplied by five;student:Five,1
teacher:Ben,1
teacher:So you did that one,1
teacher:And I think thats what you were doing earlier right,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:Four twelfths,1
teacher:Carrie,1
teacher:Matteo,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:So we have one half two fourths three sixths right,1
teacher:Are you with me,1
teacher:Could you do more,1
teacher:Is it still equivalent,1
teacher:Chloe,1
teacher:Oh;student:Two four six eight,1
teacher:So now I can add these up right,1
teacher:One half right;student:Its okay,1
teacher:Let me see how youre feeling,1
teacher:So get into  So we added other fractions we said four eighths and we said six twelfths right,1
teacher:Five;student:I think five,1
teacher:Thats pretty good right,1
teacher:Did you use the rule,1
teacher:Chloe,1
teacher:Miguel,1
teacher:Three sixths is the same as one half we agree,1
teacher:Is this still equivalent,1
teacher:So four times 12 is going to tell us how many eggs in a month right,1
teacher:So its important to know that a dozen equals 12 right,1
teacher:Do I se evidence of work,1
teacher:Do I know where the final answer is,1
teacher:Do I;student:Yes,1
teacher:So after you take your picture do me a favor I want you to go and open that picture and look at it and say Okay is Miss Calus going to be able to understand my work,1
teacher:Because if the answer is no it makes it not worth our time right,1
teacher:Okay are we ready,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Yeah Stanley,1
teacher:Oh can you guys not see it;student:350 to spend,1
teacher:There you go now can you see it,1
teacher:Natalie are you showing anything,1
teacher:Addison Lucy Emery Wallace can I see some stuff from you,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Emery,1
teacher:Emery Lucy Addison,1
teacher:Do I see some work,1
teacher:Emery Lucy,1
teacher:If I look right here I see 379 and over here I see 30 right,1
teacher:Yeah Charlie,1
teacher:Show me on your fingers how many minutes do you need;student:Thank you,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Split them up right;student:Split them up in two,1
teacher:Chloe,1
teacher:Penelope,1
teacher:Jacob,1
teacher:Chloe,1
teacher:Good right,1
teacher:Okay tell me how you feel,1
teacher:Why Chloe,1
teacher:Tell me loud Chloe,1
teacher:So you know the process you messed up on the multiplication;student:I think I did most of it right but the thing got stuck on is 10 times the number but 10 times plus five plus 90,1
teacher:Anybody else,1
teacher:Something thats really getting in their way,1
teacher:Now this can not go with you everywhere for your entire life right,1
teacher:Do you see answers in number two,1
teacher:So youre following along youre writing down what Im writing down okay,1
teacher:First Im going to start by thinking about Can you see my board okay,1
teacher:Each book costs 10 right,1
teacher:Are we done,1
teacher:We want to know how many tickets she sold right,1
teacher:So if youd rather this work to show all your steps but Ill show you a number sentence of what we did okay,1
teacher:So first we did five times seven because we took the five tickets times seven days right,1
teacher:Do you see the parentheses,1
teacher:Are you seeing how it connects to what we did,1
teacher:Then we got an answer right,1
teacher:This looks a whole lot cleaner than the mess that I just erased doesnt it,1
teacher:Im okay with either one as long as youre thinking it somewhere right,1
teacher:Who wants to read me number two,1
teacher:Oh Gabriella you want to read it,1
teacher:Toby you want to read number two,1
teacher:Perfect Toby,1
teacher:You dont want to read it;student:I actually dont,1
teacher:Valentina you want to read,1
teacher:Very similar to what we did here right,1
teacher:Any ideas,1
teacher:Four week worth of sales right,1
teacher:Are you following me,1
teacher:He ordered six packages right,1
teacher:So this is what we did this is what weve got right,1
teacher:Does anybody have a different place they want to start,1
teacher:Okay well go Lucy and then well go Valentina,1
teacher:So you want to do 50 times six,1
teacher:We have five here right,1
teacher:Thats how were going to figure out how much money hes spent right,1
teacher:I want Lucy to start out I really think you need to do four times 12 because we need to find out how many eggs shes buying in a month right,1
teacher:Anybody,1
teacher:Questions about this problem before we move on,1
teacher:All right so were looking at page 137 does somebody want to read that first question for me,1
teacher:Natalie will you read it for me,1
teacher:Does it say anything about how many ticket Hector sells,1
teacher:We just know that he wants to beat Danielle right,1
teacher:So if we multiply this times seven because theres seven days in a week then we could take that answer and multiply it by four,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:300 right,1
teacher:Kayla help us out,1
teacher:Miguel,1
teacher:Miguel,1
teacher:And Im getting smaller to bigger right,1
teacher:All right you ready for your assignment,1
teacher:So it says determine which choice shows the fractions ordered from least to greatest smallest to largest right,1
teacher:So if six13ths is the smallest so that means choice A or choice B right,1
teacher:I get six pieces no matter which way we look at it here youre getting six out of 13 thats pretty small pieces right,1
teacher:The more people I have to share with the smaller my pieces right,1
teacher:So some of them youre going to get the same number of pieces or youre going to have the same size of pieces right,1
teacher:Questions comments or concerns,1
teacher:Carrie,1
teacher:Ready to go,1
teacher:So area and perimeter should be a review for us,1
teacher:Olivia,1
teacher:That was the review on the shrink ray gun right,1
teacher:In that case were talking about the rug right,1
teacher:Samantha you think you have an idea,1
teacher:Do I get more pizza here,1
teacher:You remember this right,1
teacher:My denominators are all the same size right,1
teacher:Chloe,1
teacher:We have nine10ths and we had twothirds and we decided that nine10ths was the biggest one right,1
teacher:So we already kind of have an idea about these two fractions right,1
teacher:Now if we go back to what we just figured out we know that with this one were missing a very small piece right,1
teacher:Were getting all but that little part right,1
teacher:When we look at this one we get that much right,1
teacher:Julia;student:One,1
teacher:Onehalf right;student:Onehalf,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:Audrey,1
teacher:We took them we put them in order from the smallest piece to the largest right;student:Nine10ths,1
teacher:Penelope,1
teacher:Or the bigger the denominator the smaller the piece the smaller denominator the smaller the denominator the bigger the piece right;student:Because the bigger the pieces the smaller the number,1
teacher:Because we have a bigger denominator that means we have smaller pieces right,1
teacher:So it makes sense that my big denominators are over here on the small side right,1
teacher:Do you have it all figured out,1
teacher:Julia,1
teacher:You did this in your alien stuff the other day right,1
teacher:We have to add the lengths of all the sides right;student:You have to add the length of all the sides,1
teacher:And we can assume because this is a rectangle  that this is the same and these two are the same right,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:All right  Ready,1
teacher:Olivia okay are you done with the area;student:Almost just need one more minute,1
teacher:Now oh three and three,1
teacher:Because were adding and were multiplying does it matter if we change our order,1
teacher:Show me on thumbs how do we feel about our area and perimeter refresher,1
teacher:Do we know the area,1
teacher:Okay do we know the base,1
teacher:Well think about this as the base do we know the base,1
teacher:Do we know the height,1
teacher:Do we know the perimeter;student:Yes five,1
teacher:Can we figure them out,1
teacher:Zoe,1
teacher:Anybody else,1
teacher:Now can we figure out our perimeter,1
teacher:Does this make sense,1
teacher:Do you remember,1
teacher:20,1
teacher:20 but we both had a strategy of grouping our numbers to add right;student:Oh 20,1
teacher:Remember this,1
teacher:This was a reminder for us right,1
teacher:Looks familiar,1
teacher:Okay so we remember this right,1
teacher:Dont be afraid to use the formula that I already gave you on the board right,1
teacher:Three times seven;student:Three times seven,1
teacher:So when I look at our shape heres our shape and I look at our formula base times height I know theres a base in there right,1
teacher:Are you following me,1
teacher:Samantha,1
teacher:Do you remember that,1
teacher:Squared,1
teacher:21 inches squared because were finding an area we need to add that squared piece,1
teacher:Raise your hand if this is what you got,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you were close,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you just didnt get there yet,1
teacher:Is it this,1
teacher:21 inches,1
teacher:Show me some thumbs,1
teacher:Are you seeing that;student:Oh,1
teacher:Youre absolutely right the smaller the denominator the bigger the piece right;student:So I think its twothirds,1
teacher:Onesixth;student:Onesixth,1
teacher:Youre telling me that one times two is two;student:Three times two,1
teacher:Or one times two is one,1
teacher:Chloe,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:What about what;student:What about threefourths,1
teacher:One times two is three;student:Two,1
teacher:So does this work;student:Nine,1
teacher:Carrie,1
teacher:Ben,1
teacher:Okay so you did lots of commas;student:Okay I couldnt remember off the top of my head if that was right,1
teacher:You ready,1
teacher:any number,1
teacher:The only thing thats not going to change it is if you multiply by one right,1
teacher:200 500;student:200 500,1
teacher:Julia,1
teacher:100 right;student:100,1
teacher:Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top right,1
teacher:So in the case of onehalf if we wanted to get to twofourths we could multiply our numerator and our denominator by two right,1
teacher:Do you see how I got a green bar underneath;student:Ten,1
teacher:Are you following;student:Thats also six times six,1
teacher:Its pretty easy right,1
teacher:Can we use addition and subtraction,1
teacher:All right so before we get started on our work today were going to do a little bit of review okay;student:Exactly,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Julia you ready,1
teacher:Miguel,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:James;student:Sixtwelfths,1
teacher:Chloe;student:Sevenfourteenths,1
teacher:Nathan,1
teacher:Ben;student:Eightsixteenths,1
teacher:How many figured it out,1
teacher:Carrie,1
teacher:Our numerator is always half of our denominator right,1
teacher:Fourfifths;student:Two,1
teacher:Chloe,1
teacher:Make sure you multiply your numerators too okay,1
teacher:Chloe do you have a question,1
teacher:Are those equal,1
teacher:If I multiplied three by two I get six right,1
teacher:All right ready;student:Very different,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:All right denominators are the same right,1
teacher:The bigger the denominator the smaller the piece,1
teacher:Questions,1
teacher:So my size of my slices is the same right,1
teacher:Are my numerators the same,1
teacher:Are my denominators the same,1
teacher:Make sure you can defend your thinking okay,1
teacher:Carrie,1
teacher:Nathan,1
teacher:Is that what I heard Nathan,1
teacher:All right are you ready,1
teacher:More right;student:More,1
teacher:These are big pieces I want these from there right,1
teacher:So eight is a bigger denominator but that just means we cut the piece into more slices right,1
teacher:Ella,1
teacher:Sorry what,1
teacher:Eight20ths;student:Eight20ths,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:10 right;student:10,1
teacher:Julia,1
teacher:Matteo Matteo Miguel,1
teacher:This is how much we dont get right,1
teacher:You multiplied by 200,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:Then you cant just pick any number right,1
teacher:Questions,1
teacher:Chloe did you have another question,1
teacher:Another review are you ready,1
teacher:Onefifth is bigger;student:The bigger one,1
teacher:Penelope,1
teacher:Okay so you multiplied by a billion;student:I did two billion five billion,1
teacher:Stand when youre done,1
teacher:Questions,1
teacher:Say it,1
teacher:Julia have you come back yet,1
teacher:Michael Remy Haley are you here,1
teacher:Remy are you here,1
teacher:Julia Are you here,1
teacher:Adam are you,1
teacher:Thumbs up when you are done,1
teacher:thumbs up when you are done,1
teacher:Thumbs up when you are done please,1
teacher:Gage Are you done,1
teacher:The vocabulary you need to remember when we are talking about division we have to know the difference between the dividend the divisor and the quotient okay,1
teacher:Its that the the multiples of it does that number multiply by by something that equals the dividend okay,1
teacher:Alexa I pulled your name right out of the thing,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:s36 plus four right;student:plus 4,1
teacher:I am going to Julia Are you back yet,1
teacher:I still have to come up with four more dont I,1
teacher:Julia,1
teacher:Are you back yet Sweetie,1
teacher:How am I talking about,1
teacher:estimate the decimal;student:Im stuck on how to like estimate the decimal kinda,1
teacher:So what are the two numbers buddy,1
teacher:So your estimate would be one and a half right;student:A half,1
teacher:Yes;student:T,1
teacher:Yes;student:Mrs Strathom,1
teacher:You just finished;student:I finished,1
teacher:Yes;student:T,1
teacher:does that make sense,1
teacher:Julia,1
teacher:Are you there,1
teacher:Julia,1
teacher:Can I talk to you,1
teacher:Julia,1
teacher:Okay Julia,1
teacher:Julia are you back yet,1
teacher:Ben,1
teacher:Everybody,1
teacher:Is that making any sense to you guys,1
teacher:Did anybody get it wrong,1
teacher:Because if I have 13 if I take away 14 I have a negative number dont I,1
teacher:Can you use 100 as your first partial quotients,1
teacher:Can you use 10 as your first partial quotient,1
teacher:So you have to use 10 to get 270,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:Hey Adam can you hear me,1
teacher:Yes;student:miss Strathom,1
teacher:three minutes what;student:inauidble chromebooks,1
teacher:Haley,1
teacher:Haley Where are you,1
teacher:Okay John,1
teacher:um Reese how did you guys do;student:Because Im trying to figure out which number goes into 1647,1
teacher:Did you finish it,1
teacher:And I am going to give you what do you need,1
teacher:Did anybody get it wrong,1
teacher:or do you like both ways,1
teacher:Right Zach Im gonna ask a question are partial quotients easier for you to solve division wise than the other way;student:So I just minus that and did 100 plus 10 plus nine to get 119,1
teacher:Okay Mr Zach Im gonna come to you,1
teacher:Haley,1
teacher:I know that nine times four equals 36 Right,1
teacher:So if I have my 40 and Im dividing it by nine because those were my cards correct,1
teacher:So I know thats going to go four times right,1
teacher:So 10 minus six is four correct,1
teacher:Okay now if my number would have been if my two cards would have been 45 divided by nine I know I dont have any leftover right,1
teacher:Ava Honey are you done,1
teacher:Adam what happened to one in 412 and one and 1112th;student:Rachel has 1015ths of a cup of of a cup more chocolate chips than Maya,1
teacher:raise that blue hand on your screen,1
teacher:Adam are you done,1
teacher:Adam,1
teacher:Adam Adam,1
teacher:Adam,1
teacher:Okay Ben,1
teacher:Im going to ask Austin are you with me buddy,1
teacher:Austin Are you with me,1
teacher:Adam are you done,1
teacher:like three more minutes,1
teacher:Adam read the whole problem for number two to me please;student:Oh so for like each one,1
teacher:Read the question to me again;student:Yeah,1
teacher:and that was being able to look at a number and know things,1
teacher:inauidble This would be something You learned way back in first or second grade;student:You know what half of whatever number it was,1
teacher:Zoe you hear me,1
teacher:go ahead,1
teacher:Brendan Are you with me,1
teacher:45ths;student:four fifths,1
teacher:So thats when were estimating right,1
teacher:So that is looking at Making an estimate okay,1
teacher:But he has one tube of paint because I know that five and three equal eight right,1
teacher:Okay so Maya will you turn your microphone on please,1
teacher:So we knew that if we take one minus a half that were going to have at least a half left okay,1
teacher:Okay Miss Julia,1
teacher:Miss Julia,1
teacher:What;student:inauidble,1
teacher:Blake turn your microphone on please,1
teacher:So remember when I talked about number sense remember when I used the word number sense,1
teacher:Okay so Gage;student:Ms Strathom work his mic wasnt worth working on breakout room,1
teacher:Okay so Im going back to and I am going to call on another personMia Turn your microphone on,1
teacher:Remy Julia Are you with me,1
teacher:Okay so do you see my numbers right here,1
teacher:So in a half you have two hole parts two half pieces that make a hole it takes two hole two holes to make a whole piece okay,1
teacher:So Im going to start with Haley,1
teacher:So Ryan when you start go ahead,1
teacher:Im sorry make one fraction and what sweetie;student:I think an equivalent fraction is like a you can make one fraction and make it different numbers,1
teacher:And Im gonna ask Kate to jump in,1
teacher:Go ahead Kate,1
teacher:Okay Ethan,1
teacher:and I am going to ask Gage to turn your microphone on,1
teacher:Gage,1
teacher:Okay give me a thumbs up in your screen when you are ready,1
teacher:Thumbs up in your screen when you are ready,1
teacher:Thumbs up in your screen when you are ready,1
teacher:thumbs up in your screen when you are ready,1
teacher:Thumbs up when you are ready,1
teacher:Mhmm;student:Missy Strathom,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Landon can you please turn your microphone on,1
teacher:So you said you had one and a half,1
teacher:Adam Where are you,1
teacher:Audrey Do you want to be on with me,1
teacher:Austin,1
teacher:Do you have a question honey,1
teacher:Hey Austin,1
teacher:Um are Yeah Austin,1
teacher:So because hes giving it though were gonna subtract arent we,1
teacher:Well wouldnt it just be a half,1
teacher:Because was that one and a half minus one Just a half,1
teacher:Are my denominators the same,1
teacher:Hey Adam where are we up buddy,1
teacher:ask me what do you need to ask me,1
teacher:Whats the question,1
teacher:Im sorry Adam read it again,1
teacher:You know if he wants to know all together How much they have wouldnt I be adding them;student:I disagree with that because thats kind of a subtraction problem,1
teacher:Miss Elliot,1
teacher:Remy you got this buddy,1
teacher:Remy are you there,1
teacher:Thumbs up I need to see,1
teacher:Am I correct,1
teacher:So am I correct that your estimate looked like this,1
teacher:What did you so say,1
teacher:Is that correct,1
teacher:And isnt 2920 is the same as one and 920ths,1
teacher:Who is talking;student:Miss Strathom,1
teacher:Yes Maddy;student:Maddy,1
teacher:What do you do you want me to read the second one,1
teacher:Because if I have one and 920ths minus 18 twentieths Im gonna get a negative number arent I,1
teacher:Alright so Austin turn your mic on,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Austin youve got that Am I correct,1
teacher:And if you dont understand how to do the ones with a mixed number turning it into an improper fraction I want you to ask me okay,1
teacher:Did you all Thumbs up if you believe the discussions that you had gave you what you need to take this assessment,1
teacher:10 questions,1
teacher:Thumbs up,1
teacher:Blake Can you hear me sweetie,1
teacher:read the numbers to me first;student:Yeah two,1
teacher:Remy go ahead,1
teacher:All the way down,1
teacher:So thats renaming a fraction okay,1
teacher:And when you are done with these I want you to stand up,1
teacher:Ethan,1
teacher:Read the first one,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:No no go ahead Elijah;student:To write like,1
teacher:You got Im sorry what;student:I got 112,1
teacher:Stand when you are done,1
teacher:Stand when you are done,1
teacher:When you are done stand up,1
teacher:Ross whats going on,1
teacher:What can I help you with,1
teacher:Miss Landon do you have the first one done one and a half miles,1
teacher:So the smaller my fraction the more I need to make the half right,1
teacher:Frac Landon turnaround whats wrong,1
teacher:Are we ready,1
teacher:Question,1
teacher:Yes;student:Miss Strathom,1
teacher:Whats your question Adam,1
teacher:Do you get this enough to do it on your own,1
teacher:Mr Gage Do you think you have this enough,1
teacher:So we have three total people right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Okay so tell me about this kind of Adam what do you think,1
teacher:What question Can I clarify,1
teacher:How did that go for you,1
teacher:Landon went good,1
teacher:Reese went good,1
teacher:Audrey went good,1
teacher:Reese,1
teacher:I have my five cans right,1
teacher:Audrey,1
teacher:You have a question;student:Mom I still have a question,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:make sense,1
teacher:So did you all hear what she said,1
teacher:Do you know what I thinks happening,1
teacher:Am I correct,1
teacher:Harmony you paying attention or are you reading,1
teacher:Oh dear Lord Ive totally reversed those numbers didnt I,1
teacher:Its telling you what is it closer to,1
teacher:Is it closer to a whole,1
teacher:Stand when youre done,1
teacher:Do you need me to guide some questions for you,1
teacher:Stand when youre done,1
teacher:Gage go ahead,1
teacher:Im sorry what;student:Um it would be so the answer,1
teacher:Okay so did we rename a mixed number,1
teacher:Did we use a benchmark;student:Yes,1
teacher:So should I just have an answer on my board,1
teacher:See how Ive done it,1
teacher:Yes;student:Miss Strathom,1
teacher:When you got an answer please stand up,1
teacher:When you have completed those stand up,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:I know that right here is one whole right,1
teacher:Okay so I know that three thirds is one whole right,1
teacher:Everybody,1
teacher:So do you see the benefit of marking them on the number line,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Alright so we just discussed how the number line can help us rename improper fractions right,1
teacher:And whos sharing,1
teacher:Does the question make sense,1
teacher:Okay go ahead;student:Yes,1
teacher:Kate what,1
teacher:Abby,1
teacher:When youve got those done please stand up,1
teacher:Stand,1
teacher:Im gonna have the two of you discuss,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Is this correct,1
teacher:Oh can I place Dans yet;student:Four,1
teacher:So I automatically know by looking at this Dans plant is bigger dont I,1
teacher:Its closer to the whole isnt it;student:The one,1
teacher:And did it stop it from being this long doing 10,1
teacher:Okay now we would keep going until we have them all get their answer okay,1
teacher:So go ahead;student:Oh I would have to cut it into fourths,1
teacher:Its in my ones right,1
teacher:Remember I have to use all the numbers within the dividend,1
teacher:Does that make sense Maddy;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Does it make better sense when I give you the arrows Maddy,1
teacher:now I still have to subtract this dont I,1
teacher:Well the only thing I can do is times one correct,1
teacher:Any questions on the partial quotients,1
teacher:Yes Maya,1
teacher:Any other questions,1
teacher:So the rest of you are telling me you want to stay with me,1
teacher:So Adam I think you just would like a refresher am I correct,1
teacher:Okay Landon what part are you struggling with,1
teacher:Daily process,1
teacher:Okay if any one is different than the process please tell me,1
teacher:Okay now I know that 15 times nothing equals eight right,1
teacher:If I look back at the way our video taught us how to do this I know that Im going to look and say 11 does not go into 2 correct,1
teacher:So now I have 12 minus five which is seven right,1
teacher:You are filling these out the same way I am okay,1
teacher:So how can What did you say,1
teacher:It takes a long time doesnt it,1
teacher:Okay blue hands up when you are done with this,1
teacher:blue hands up when you are done with this please,1
teacher:Raise your hands when you are done,1
teacher:Raise your hands when you are done,1
teacher:Do not forget to raise your hand when you are done,1
teacher:Okay were gonna go ahead and start Mr Landon,1
teacher:Landon  Go ahead,1
teacher:125,1
teacher:divided by five,1
teacher:Okay Kate turn yours on please,1
teacher:Do you see how we are mixing the multiplication to justify the division,1
teacher:Okay Kate go ahead,1
teacher:Mr Gage,1
teacher:Gage,1
teacher:So I am going to give you an example of partial quotients my friends okay,1
teacher:Now I have to add that five in right,1
teacher:So 825 divided by 15 equals 55 questions,1
teacher:questions,1
teacher:Go ahead rogan,1
teacher:Okay Maddy can you turn your microphone on;student:But I said four divided by two plus three,1
teacher:Landon turn your microphone back on,1
teacher:Tell me what Maddy just said,1
teacher:Does that make sense Landon,1
teacher:Zach or not Zach Matt,1
teacher:You look the words in the problem Okay,1
teacher:Could you use fraction circles to help you solve the problem or model the situation,1
teacher:Miss Zoe,1
teacher:John could you turn your microphone on,1
teacher:John turn your microphone on,1
teacher:Mr Gage Thompson Turn your microphone on,1
teacher:Six,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Ethan,1
teacher:RoganTurn your microphone on and Matt be able to explain what rogan said afterwards;student:Um Rogan,1
teacher:Yeah you do;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Yeah can you,1
teacher:Mr Matt can you turn on your microphone,1
teacher:And how can you ask a question to better understand this process,1
teacher:Maya go ahead,1
teacher:Okay so youre not understanding why I put the number up here;student:I kinda still dont understand how youve figured out which number to do it to get five like at the top to get the first five like 55,1
teacher:Can you see that,1
teacher:Okay Julia,1
teacher:Makes sense,1
teacher:So I know that I cant multiply it by 15 times six to get the closest to 82 can I,1
teacher:So what they did here is they took 123456 squares okay,1
teacher:So do you see that if I write it that way,1
teacher:Yes Kate,1
teacher:Anybody else Have Any other questions,1
teacher:Adam Do you have a question,1
teacher:Yes Maddy;student:Miss Miss Strathom,1
teacher:Notice that I divided my numerator into my denominator okay,1
teacher:All right Mr Zach you are the lucky,1
teacher:go ahead,1
teacher:Yes;student:Ms Strathom,1
teacher:Is that four digits,1
teacher:Um well it looks like its going to be Duncan,1
teacher:Do you see,1
teacher:100,1
teacher:Are you done,1
teacher:If I asked you to write your name on your whiteboard stand up,1
teacher:Come on up,1
teacher:Okay Ethan go,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Go ahead Elijah,1
teacher:Have I said whos right yet,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Okay Jake go ahead,1
teacher:210;student:I added 30 and I got 210,1
teacher:210,1
teacher:So she looked at it as just 9 times 3 and then knew that it would be 270 right,1
teacher:I can do it in some of them but then I get too big and it totally floors me okay,1
teacher:If area model has to be done first understand partial products to then understand US traditional thats what you use okay,1
teacher:Pardon me,1
teacher:Do you remember what partial products are,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:That concept you also have to understand and master okay,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Tell me what you think,1
teacher:Is it going to change,1
teacher:Are they the same,1
teacher:Its only one 10;student:Because if you do the same question from before and then just can  its still one 10,1
teacher:You understand whered you make your mistake,1
teacher:So 10 is no different than 10 to the power of one is it,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:20000,1
teacher:2000,1
teacher:270000;student:My estimate is 270000,1
teacher:Would I do it that way,1
teacher:And you have to master it by one digit multiplying and you have to master it by two digit multiplying okay,1
teacher:So you will know you are successful if you can solve two multiplication problems on page 48 using US traditional method using the US traditional method okay,1
teacher:What;student:Can we take our planners out too,1
teacher:Is this any different than this,1
teacher:How did that  Did this help you get this,1
teacher:So Im going to draw a box this is really no different than lattice its only looking at it differently okay,1
teacher:50 plus 6 is 56 right,1
teacher:Does this make sense,1
teacher:Thumbs up;student:Yes,1
teacher:How have we done that,1
teacher:I feel 100 confidence that everybody got it okay;student:Yes,1
teacher:Now  Landon what did you just say;student:Yes,1
teacher:I want you to use the partial products like I was showing you or US traditional okay;student:Wait so you actually  the one that the guy showed us,1
teacher:Is 900 right,1
teacher:This Is US traditional okay,1
teacher:So were going to talk about reasonableness because this is where it is vitally vitally important that you understand if I make an estimate okay,1
teacher:Is that even a reasonable estimation,1
teacher:Is it okay if I estimate space for 20 kids,1
teacher:Because I can throw two more in there cant I;student:Yeah,1
teacher:But because I dont have places in tens in both places do I think maybe it could be four hundred and forty four,1
teacher:So remember the other day when I did the estimate,1
teacher:And I multiplied it wrong,1
teacher:It is much easier to multiply this way isnt it,1
teacher:Would it be only 24,1
teacher:Nate,1
teacher:But knowing that the value of that 2 makes it a 20 makes me know that it has to be 80 okay;student:Yeah,1
teacher:So you see how I got that number,1
teacher:If I dont know how to do 7 times 50 can I do 7 times 5,1
teacher:So all is Im doing is Im adding those together okay,1
teacher:Did I do 7 times 6,1
teacher:Did I do 7 times 6 over here,1
teacher:And that equals 42 right;student:Yes,1
teacher:This is what makes it partial products is I am doing the actual product of the numbers of the number sentence okay,1
teacher:Or is it going to change,1
teacher:Does this make sense,1
teacher:Am I really only doing 4 times 2,1
teacher:The area model;student:So,1
teacher:Elijah,1
teacher:Nate,1
teacher:Nate,1
teacher:You have to understand that using the area model we are looking at the value of the number okay,1
teacher:Tom come talk to me,1
teacher:Is it 2,1
teacher:And my guess was twelve hundred,1
teacher:Okay go ahead Im sorry;student:And then,1
teacher:The next person it is your turn to go,1
teacher:So if I see 10 to the power of six is it easiest for me to write it out in standard form,1
teacher:Really;student:Exponential notation,1
teacher:Because I know that I have a one a 10 and its got to have five zeros with it right,1
teacher:Jake,1
teacher:This is in the canyons of your mind we just need to pull it to the forefront okay,1
teacher:Everybody,1
teacher:A written number with an exponent like 10 to the power of 3 is exponential notation okay,1
teacher:I think I said this was exponential but this the actual base the exponent and the base are your exponential notation okay,1
teacher:If I were to actually think that I needed to do that multiplication all by myself I want you to think about the process it would take okay,1
teacher:Notice,1
teacher:Do you see a pattern,1
teacher:Thats an awful long way to do that problem isnt it,1
teacher:Much easier than me doing this huh,1
teacher:So think about this exponential notation okay;student:What was the question again,1
teacher:So if I know the place value system am I able to determine how many zeros need to be attached on that 10,1
teacher:Once youve got it turn and talk,1
teacher:100000000000;student:Three,1
teacher:Think about what we need to do with this number write it on our thing and then turn and talk with your neighbors once youre written it,1
teacher:Without moving close to them okay,1
teacher:Need a few more,1
teacher:So if I am looking at numbers I see that Olivia has 7 are you done,1
teacher:Which makes it worth 10 times as much okay,1
teacher:Okay everybody got that,1
teacher:Thumbs up if you got it,1
teacher:So all it does is changes positions in the place value chart and it becomes either 10 times greater or a tenth less okay,1
teacher:Its invisible okay,1
teacher:Guess what,1
teacher:I can explain patterns in the number of zeros when multiplying by powers of 10 okay,1
teacher:We were learning about all of that okay,1
teacher:So four times four times four is four to the third power okay,1
teacher:So base the number being multiplied repeatedly okay,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:Sometimes its four to the power of three six to the power of seven okay,1
teacher:Am I adding a zero,1
teacher:So can you model for me how you would turn and talk to your partner,1
teacher:Am I getting bigger,1
teacher:Or am I getting smaller,1
teacher:Does 10 to the power of seven work on that,1
teacher:Do you need the pattern,1
teacher:And if you forget do we have a resource over her,1
teacher:The powers of okay,1
teacher:Emily,1
teacher:Got it;student:Zero,1
teacher:So if I estimate that a 100 times a 100 is 10 is that reasonable,1
teacher:Dont solve it just say Ive given you four and Im multiplying it by 10 to the power of I said three right,1
teacher:So is it okay to look at the problem and know that four times one or anything times one is that answer,1
teacher:And then attach those zeros;student:Yes,1
teacher:Does it make sense if Im multiplying five times 10 to the power of nine that my answers going to come out to be 5000,1
teacher:Now is it okay to say a million or 10 million,1
teacher:Bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump,1
teacher:Person with the longest hair is going to start,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:And go,1
teacher:So it would just be the 1000000 right,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Did we use this at all on those,1
teacher:Did this come first in the pattern up here,1
teacher:Rylan got that;student:10 to the power of five,1
teacher:Cameron got it,1
teacher:Andrew got it,1
teacher:When youre done with that chart give me a thumbs up,1
teacher:When you are done with the chart give me a thumbs up,1
teacher:Thumbs up,1
teacher:Thumbs up,1
teacher:And go,1
teacher:Give me a thumbs up,1
teacher:Thumbs up,1
teacher:Thumbs up when you are done;student:Thumbs up,1
teacher:Thumbs up all the way done all the way done,1
teacher:You seeing the patterns,1
teacher:Are you seeing the patterns,1
teacher:Three;student:Three,1
teacher:1000000000 right,1
teacher:Thumbs up,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you feel comfortable sharing your answer,1
teacher:Now because that would be two hundred twenty three times three okay,1
teacher:Correct,1
teacher:What question Can I clarify,1
teacher:Landon went good,1
teacher:Reese went good,1
teacher:Audrey went good,1
teacher:Reese,1
teacher:I have my five cans right,1
teacher:Audrey,1
teacher:You have a question;student:Mom I still have a question,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Whats your question Adam,1
teacher:make sense,1
teacher:So I have divided my area model up into four different sections okay,1
teacher:so my whole numbers so Im multiplying first my whole number one times two which equals two and then one times four tenths which equals four tons and then Im doing three tenthss times two which equals six tenths and then three tenths times four tenths which equals 12 hundredths okay,1
teacher:that is this piece over here where we lined them all up to add them together after we calculated them okay,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Okay so tell me about this kind of Adam what do you think,1
teacher:What;student:Ms Strathom  I cant type the letters in the box,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Or do you need to work with me,1
teacher:You look the words in the problem Okay,1
teacher:Could you use fraction circles to help you solve the problem or model the situation,1
teacher:Miss Zoe,1
teacher:John could you turn your microphone on,1
teacher:John turn your microphone on,1
teacher:Mr Gage Thompson Turn your microphone on,1
teacher:Six,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Ethan,1
teacher:So go ahead;student:Oh I would have to cut it into fourths,1
teacher:So what they did here is they took 123456 squares okay,1
teacher:Okay now we would keep going until we have them all get their answer okay,1
teacher:Kate what,1
teacher:Do you get this enough to do it on your own,1
teacher:Mr Gage Do you think you have this enough,1
teacher:So we have three total people right,1
teacher:Zach go ahead honey,1
teacher:Are you trying to explain,1
teacher:Yes;student:T,1
teacher:Give me a thumbs up if you understand this,1
teacher:Okay so Im gonna ask a question Zach do you understand it well enough to teach someone thats here,1
teacher:by using your whiteboard to teach,1
teacher:Okay Zach go ahead,1
teacher:Yes;student:T,1
teacher:So the way that I am going to do that is I am going to divide my area model into four boxes because I have four numbers dont I,1
teacher:Isnt it,1
teacher:Landon Does that make sense to you,1
teacher:Yes Duncan,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Landon,1
teacher:RightDoes that make sense,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:All right Duncan help me with the next one,1
teacher:Zach,1
teacher:Can you do that Landon,1
teacher:Can you go with that for me,1
teacher:The most important piece here is that you are able to multiply the decimal by the decimal then add them together in order to be able to To get the answer okay,1
teacher:So do you see the difference between your whiteboard and my whiteboard Landon,1
teacher:Is that what you just asked me,1
teacher:So if I multiply 300ths times seven tenths Do I really have two holes Maddy,1
teacher:Im sorry what;student:T,1
teacher:Yes maam;student:T,1
teacher:So do you see how were progressing further and our pieces are getting smaller and smaller and smaller,1
teacher:I will stop sharing and have you hold your whiteboard okay,1
teacher:So youre going to line each of these up remember,1
teacher:Zach or not Zach Matt,1
teacher:Adam do you know what youre doing buddy,1
teacher:What are you saying Adam;student:inauidble Thats like way too much,1
teacher:Im going to stop sharing and I am going to ask Miss Julia to turn her camera on,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Do you see how all of my decimals are in a row,1
teacher:Landon;student:Yeah,1
teacher:So its not 61000ths,1
teacher:370 600 1000s So do you see the importance of why I have to line those decimals up so carefully,1
teacher:What honey;student:Im adding both,1
teacher:Ethan,1
teacher:Does that make sense Landon,1
teacher:Landon turn your microphone back on,1
teacher:Hey,1
teacher:Excellent,1
teacher:I would like you to complete one two three explain how that estimation helped you and I would like you to complete this area model over here,1
teacher:Yeah I was confused at what she said,1
teacher:We are going to do this for five ten fifteen twenty minutes,1
teacher:So go ahead,1
teacher:And lets start with Kate,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Okay Kate can I ask you a question;student:I said that that was one whole and down here theres 210 and then I added those together and I got I got one one and 210,1
teacher:Okay Zoe,1
teacher:Excellent job okay so Landon Im going to come to you now Landon are you frozen;student:So thats how when where I put the one and then I saw that there was two tenths left so that I put the two,1
teacher:So Landon,1
teacher:Do you understand how to color in the 10th part,1
teacher:Everybody show me your papers again,1
teacher:Show me your papers,1
teacher:Mmhmmm,1
teacher:Everybody show me your papers,1
teacher:Is it okay if I talk about you Miss Layla,1
teacher:And what is fifteen plus three,1
teacher:Yall agree with that,1
teacher:I automatically know that I can write the twenty right,1
teacher:Is that right,1
teacher:Isnt it automatically already in the hundreds place,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Everybody understand,1
teacher:You did one times four;student:No,1
teacher:Then you were doing fifty four times ten which is five hundred and forty,1
teacher:Okay,1
teacher:Good call,1
teacher:All right,1
teacher:I want you to solve it,1
teacher:So I solved it but I dont understand,1
teacher:Hey show me your whiteboards,1
teacher:Fifteen,1
teacher:Ive now moved to the tens,1
teacher:Cadence wheres yours,1
teacher:Michael wheres yours,1
teacher:So Michael where are the colors to help you remember to demonstrate your understanding of it,1
teacher:Did I just write this wrong for you,1
teacher:Am I correct,1
teacher:Eight times two is really six;student:And then um,1
teacher:Does that make better sense to you now Julia,1
teacher:So if I have 17 divided by 100 Im going to write 17 as a whole number right,1
teacher:So basically they were talking about base 10 value werent they,1
teacher:I do know my multiplication facts but I was helping you understand,1
teacher:This was how many of you got at least one problem done,1
teacher:Yes Zach,1
teacher:Notice that I divided my numerator into my denominator okay,1
teacher:All right Mr Zach you are the lucky,1
teacher:go ahead,1
teacher:Mr Matt can you turn on your microphone,1
teacher:Go ahead Landon,1
teacher:Okay Maddy can you turn your microphone on;student:But I said four divided by two plus three,1
teacher:Can you talk a little louder honey;student:So I did 50 times 8,1
teacher:Next Julia,1
teacher:I dont have any wholes right there do I,1
teacher:Two and 110,1
teacher:Can you do that for me later,1
teacher:Haley while Zachs talking put your things up please,1
teacher:Nico need to see yours Blake need to see yours,1
teacher:Haley,1
teacher:And we are going to go into todays lesson okay,1
teacher:Okay I want everybody to say 184 thousandths,1
teacher:Together on 3,1
teacher:Tell me what Maddy just said,1
teacher:123,1
teacher:Alright so you all should have this on your screen,1
teacher:Am I correct,1
teacher:So if I look at that I know that because we started with the tenths my outcome has to be a difference okay,1
teacher:So if its 21 Landon I know that it would be simply that dont I,1
teacher:I have to move it one right there correct;student:Since were multiplying you have to move it to the right,1
teacher:Could I also have just brought it down in this instance,1
teacher:Did everybody get 21 on that,1
teacher:You all know that,1
teacher:Does anybody need help with the reading of that,1
teacher:Is that going to be less than what we started with,1
teacher:Im sorry;student:We dont know what cards hes using,1
teacher:Yes Ma am,1
teacher:Yes Sir,1
teacher:What are you confused with,1
teacher:See,1
teacher:Okay Makes sense,1
teacher:Everybody got it written down,1
teacher:You said that 3 went into 6 2 times right,1
teacher:It cant go into it 3 times can it,1
teacher:Does that make more sense,1
teacher:Do you see why you cant start from that side and work over,1
teacher:Oh you said the eight down here,1
teacher:Yes sir;student:Excuse me,1
teacher:Would I have to round this up,1
teacher:Can I,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:If you use another type of division you use another type of division but that division has to show me that conceptually you understand it okay,1
teacher:You see what you did wrong,1
teacher:and I need to see your estimate then I need to see your work down here just as I saw Stacys okay,1
teacher:Good,1
teacher:So tonight with that being said in addition to the multiplication and division we will be working on in math club we will be working on rounding okay,1
teacher:Shawn would you come over here please,1
teacher:005;student:because its,1
teacher:075 you didnt do anything but eliminate that one;student:Yes its,1
teacher:Do you see what Im saying,1
teacher:Do you understand why Im saying your division was not complete;student:Okay,1
teacher:Okay does that make sense,1
teacher:Work the problem all the way through okay,1
teacher:What mathematical process do I need to use okay,1
teacher:12 cents right,1
teacher:Do you see I was able to break it apart like that;student:30 cents,1
teacher:There might be a thousandths left okay,1
teacher:All right theyre going to want you to use estimation today and theyre going to want to prove why your estimation works does that make sense,1
teacher:I would like Matty Archiel Lisa Andy Jimmy Vivian good or not so good,1
teacher:You sure,1
teacher:You must show all of your work okay,1
teacher:All right when you divide do you use partial quotients,1
teacher:Now I have to subtract that am I correct,1
teacher:Can I take four from five,1
teacher:Show me with your fingers from a one two three or four your understanding of the chart before we start because youre going to have to use that to solve the problems,1
teacher:Joey,1
teacher:Beep beep beep,1
teacher:Beep beep beep,1
teacher:Did everybody get 126,1
teacher:If they pay 200 do you think they want some change back,1
teacher:Im going to just call on a group to share how about team number three,1
teacher:Could I give them back 74 ones,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Look at the first star and read that with me,1
teacher:How about Carter,1
teacher:Have you seen partial before,1
teacher:Dennis,1
teacher:Can you try it both ways,1
teacher:Are all eyes up on the board,1
teacher:Could you show that 100 is more than all the other ones;student:A hundred is equal to a hundred because they both have a hundred,1
teacher:Louie,1
teacher:James and Ella can you guys stand up;student:Ella,1
teacher:Are you all done,1
teacher:Did you check yours and it was good,1
teacher:The first two were good,1
teacher:What about Jyle,1
teacher:Oh this ones easy that ended with a five you would have made that a 3 youd have rounded it so 5 6 42 20 then that 5 would have rounded it to a 3 it makes sense,1
teacher:You add remainder five you would change that to three because were rounding okay,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:do I,1
teacher:Were struggling a little bit arent we,1
teacher:Read the first one with me,1
teacher:The second one;student:I can solve problems including conversions between money units,1
teacher:Thumb up if youre done,1
teacher:Thumb up out of your shoulder if you got that right,1
teacher:Can you prove your answer,1
teacher:Can you answer and prove,1
teacher:All right go ahead and turn and talk to your partner decide whos going to go first,1
teacher:Do you want this in long division,1
teacher:Can you draw your rectangle,1
teacher:Yes sir,1
teacher:You will use whatever way you need to use to divide whatever way you need to okay,1
teacher:Franc and Robyn discuss this,1
teacher:If the second factor is greater than one what do we know about the product Martin,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:Martin,1
teacher:Estimate okay,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:What;student:Are you going to,1
teacher:When you are asked to round is it easy to multiply 13 times 185,1
teacher:Is it easy to multiply 10 by 200;student:No,1
teacher:Am I correct,1
teacher:Your estimate was 41 correct,1
teacher:Understand,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Okay thats not the objective though that were looking for is it;student:No I knew that 11x28 will make it 308,1
teacher:Go ahead talk to me,1
teacher:Discuss it quickly go,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Discuss it,1
teacher:I dont have a whole group of two do I;student:It would be less than because you cant multiply a small,1
teacher:Good,1
teacher:Good,1
teacher:Good,1
teacher:Good,1
teacher:You and your partner discuss this when youve got the answer sit down,1
teacher:You already have it and you already have it,1
teacher:Vicki,1
teacher:How much is left,1
teacher:That number is bigger than six,1
teacher:What did you just say;student:Itll be less than,1
teacher:That product is less than one group of six all right,1
teacher:Rebecca,1
teacher:Who can answer this,1
teacher:Its going to be greater than right,1
teacher:Think about what we talked about up above Roge,1
teacher:Roberto you need to be able to look at those and think about that rule that quick okay;student:No you dont,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Alexander,1
teacher:What of the decimal places are they all in the same place;student:It goes biggest medium and then small,1
teacher:Can I help you,1
teacher:Thats what I was looking for so if this one is 410 one times we know that ones correct right;student:Its the same number,1
teacher:Would it be easier just to do it by 400,1
teacher:You would write your explanation of what you did here with the three and the four okay,1
teacher:Makes sense,1
teacher:Okay I would like you to explain number two when everybody comes okay;student:What,1
teacher:Okay and I was going to ask you to do number three okay,1
teacher:Roge,1
teacher:Exactly and then I took a half away from the three and I had taken 10 away which then explained okay;student:Easier to do 400 x 3,1
teacher:I want you to be able to do this alone okay,1
teacher:I want you to show me how you did it and I want you to explain to me why it makes sense okay,1
teacher:Yes sir,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:Any other questions,1
teacher:So you will be using division and estimating it so that it makes sense that you can come up with an actual type of answer okay,1
teacher:Okay go ahead,1
teacher:If you need to move my keyboard go ahead,1
teacher:So hes earned 10;student:What I did was I did 10   10 which I knew that 10 x 10 is 100 so hes raised 10,1
teacher:When youve got the answer stand up,1
teacher:Are they going to be the same numbers,1
teacher:Theyre not going to be the same digits;student:No,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:You are estimating okay,1
teacher:Partner you just worked with okay,1
teacher:By doing that we knew that that decimal needed to jump over two spaces because it went one here and it went one there makes sense,1
teacher:Got it,1
teacher:Yes sir,1
teacher:Anna are you done,1
teacher:Is six closer to one whole,1
teacher:In this instance am I closer to a dollar or closer to 50 cents which in this instance is not a whole is it,1
teacher:Is that any place close to that,1
teacher:Thats why that you have to look at it as a half not a whole or its 0x300 but thats not going to cut it in half is it,1
teacher:Do you see how easy that is friends,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Here friend you may use this one until I get you through okay;student:I dont have,1
teacher:Are you rounding the numbers,1
teacher:Got it,1
teacher:Do you remember how to do that the other day;student:Yes,1
teacher:Please help with your fingers how long you need to finish,1
teacher:Yes this is not a complete rectangle okay;student:That one isnt a complete square  complete rectangle,1
teacher:Are all eyes up here,1
teacher:Does everybody see how theres a little square missing right here,1
teacher:Knowing how to add things up but something I noticed if I were to complete this rectangle would I know my length and width,1
teacher:Holly,1
teacher:Does everybody see how the four and two add up to six,1
teacher:Could I use my area of 60 and subtract this,1
teacher:They have to actually You dont want to buy too much carpet carpets really expensive and so does everybody notice how this is not a complete rectangle,1
teacher:Stand up if you would prefer to divide it into sections and to find the area of each section and add up,1
teacher:Stand up if you would prefer to find the area the whole shape and subtract the piece missing,1
teacher:Show me with your fingers how you feel about this standard today,1
teacher:Were going to see can you get the same answer for here,1
teacher:Any questions about math,1
teacher:What do you see up here,1
teacher:I want you to read the learning intention with me for 412,1
teacher:Jaden,1
teacher:Have we done these before,1
teacher:What is this compared to Are they the same,1
teacher:Everybody here that,1
teacher:James dont forget your clipboard,1
teacher:Did anybody make this connection,1
teacher:Do I have someone who would be willing to share even if they didnt get it right,1
teacher:Did you get it right Louie,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:Do you want to come up and share,1
teacher:Joey,1
teacher:Mila,1
teacher:You dont want to accidentally multiply something you shouldnt right,1
teacher:Do you see the one two three and four;student:Maybe,1
teacher:Anybody anybody,1
teacher:Can I please have one more person share one more person,1
teacher:I need one more,1
teacher:Levi thank you so much,1
teacher:Do you guys see the difference between multiplying by 18 and 9;student:Thats how I got the,1
teacher:Do you guys see this shape up here,1
teacher:I heard some clue multiplication words right,1
teacher:Can you figure how much one package costs,1
teacher:Natalie you started,1
teacher:Christine,1
teacher:Were going to do what we did before where were going to try it were going to talk about it with a partner and share,1
teacher:Thats tricky isnt it,1
teacher:Anybody else who needs some help,1
teacher:If you look Beep beep beep,1
teacher:Did you get an answer,1
teacher:Did everybody get 76,1
teacher:Now we know how much for four strings but then if you go the next part what does the next part say,1
teacher:So if you look Can I help you with your picture,1
teacher:For each set its 8 right,1
teacher:Each one is going to be 8 right,1
teacher:Did you,1
teacher:Ava,1
teacher:Is it,1
teacher:Now did that help,1
teacher:Ava,1
teacher:Charlotte,1
teacher:10 nine eight seven six if you can make it five four three two and what is he saying,1
teacher:Mason,1
teacher:50 x 6,1
teacher:I want you to share,1
teacher:Decide who is going to share first and you can go,1
teacher:I am going to be pulling a couple of cards and what I want you to do is come up with your neighbor,1
teacher:Kennedy I pulled your card,1
teacher:You know what Kennedy,1
teacher:Are you okay with that,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Kennedy bring your dryerase board up,1
teacher:He was taking off groups of 50 and then I said Oh if you think about the problem hes buying packages right,1
teacher:Each book costs 10 and each package I think held 5,1
teacher:Is that correct,1
teacher:I need to go back and look,1
teacher:Is that correct,1
teacher:Did you get that,1
teacher:Its 300 right,1
teacher:Does everybody see that,1
teacher:We think of is there anything to decompose in 20;student:Yes,1
teacher:Right now I want you to share with your neighbor someone sitting right by you,1
teacher:Partial;student:Partial,1
teacher:how long you need,1
teacher:Look here everybody say 30 x 20,1
teacher:Is that anything,1
teacher:Do I need to write the zero,1
teacher:Do you notice all of these are the same with these,1
teacher:Raise your hands if you like to start with this one first,1
teacher:Raise your hands if you just went for it and you tried this one;student:Yes,1
teacher:Show me with the one two three four how you feel about partition rectangles first of all,1
teacher:Everybody say it with me I want you to say this,1
teacher:40 x 50 40 x 6 2 x 50 2 x 6,1
teacher:Does that help anybody,1
teacher:Raise your hands if you did find the mistake,1
teacher:Did you do a partition rectangle,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you ve moved on and you re doing some of the other ones now,1
teacher:The partial products,1
teacher:Everybody say Decompose,1
teacher:30 times,1
teacher:Stand up if you understand what we did with the partition rectangle,1
teacher:How many see it,1
teacher:Another minute or two,1
teacher:Remember how we decompose the number,1
teacher:That makes sense,1
teacher:I think you were trying to figure out what did it look like,1
teacher:20 x 4,1
teacher:There is a group of three right here so all three of you can talk but youre going to turn to talk with your A and B partner so if you look on your map theres an A and B,1
teacher:Go ahead and talk,1
teacher:Everybody share with a lot;student:Okay,1
teacher:Does anybody know how to do a partial product with the second one,1
teacher:Has anybody tried it out;student:No one,1
teacher:Thumb up if you got 680,1
teacher:All right James,1
teacher:Has everybody seen what he did,1
teacher:Carter,1
teacher:Turn and talk to your neighbor,1
teacher:Stand up if you see a connection with what we did,1
teacher:Can you draw your partition rectangle;student:30 x 20,1
teacher:You can add on you can justify your answer you can revise your thinking all right go,1
teacher:Do you want to come over and talk with this group;student:I said that they re correcting,1
teacher:How about number eight,1
teacher:Who is number eight,1
teacher:Everybody read that with me,1
teacher:Sections right,1
teacher:Do we know the width,1
teacher:Do we know the other length;student:No,1
teacher:Do you know them,1
teacher:Please show me with your fingers how long you need,1
teacher:Two to three minutes,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Just get it up there and Ill see if they can fix it okay,1
teacher:I want someone to actually summarize what he says,1
teacher:Right James,1
teacher:Now can I do area on step one,1
teacher:Someone else who is listening,1
teacher:Thumb up if you got length times width,1
teacher:How about my friend number 24,1
teacher:Can anyone remember,1
teacher:Thumb up if you see the word area,1
teacher:They did;student:I starred that because I feel like I did the explaining and everyone in my group did it pretty close explanation,1
teacher:Is it in the ones place,1
teacher:James can you come up,1
teacher:Come on up James,1
teacher:Does anybody do a rectangle to show that connection,1
teacher:Who made a partition rectangle that they want to com share and put under the duck camera,1
teacher:Aubrey did you do one,1
teacher:Show me with your fingers how long you need,1
teacher:Who did a partition rectangle that they want to share,1
teacher:Rynn do you want to share your partition rectangle;student:I did a partition rectangle,1
teacher:Come on up don t be scared it s okay I promise,1
teacher:Do you see how you would break 20 to 20 and eight in eight ones,1
teacher:Who revised their thinking,1
teacher:Charlotte can you bring it up real quick;student:Yes she put an 80,1
teacher:Good job which one,1
teacher:All right your job is to use some partial products can you do a rectangle if you need to,1
teacher:What;student:I did,1
teacher:Did Mrs Tolliver help get you started was what you were doing,1
teacher:You knew it was greater right by looking at it and you knew why,1
teacher:Eric,1
teacher:Table leaders stand up,1
teacher:Zoe,1
teacher:Cookie;student:Most of us said cookie,1
teacher:All right do a quick talk at your table,1
teacher:Quick turn and talk go,1
teacher:Kurt;student:I switched,1
teacher:Are you writing and listening,1
teacher:Why are you not writing,1
teacher:You were,1
teacher:How are we doing,1
teacher:Person number two stand up,1
teacher:Person number two stand up,1
teacher:Ladies are you all done,1
teacher:All done,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:All right go to a zero or sorry  please turn and discuss with your table partners go,1
teacher:Tell me Roge,1
teacher:Did you play around the world  When Im buying something can I use multiplication if Im buying multiple things,1
teacher:When I say go what should be the first thing that youre doing,1
teacher:Can I divide that into thirds,1
teacher:Yes sir;student:No its not like,1
teacher:Rebecca are you doing your job,1
teacher:Are you ready for me to,1
teacher:You think threefourths is bigger,1
teacher:Frankie you said three fours times three is greater than three fourths correct;student:I wanted to  because when youre multiplying something youre breaking it up in smaller parts and stuff,1
teacher:Is that what you said,1
teacher:I have to put the denominator;student:Because  you would have to put the denominator two  to multiply,1
teacher:I would put my three over four,1
teacher:Are you ready for,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Threefourths times one is greater than three fourths;student:I was saying that three fourths is greater,1
teacher:You think that 34 is bigger so 34 times 1 12 is less than;student:I think that 34 is bigger,1
teacher:I would like you to discuss these with a partner,1
teacher:Roge what is your job right this moment,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Its what,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:All right so Margo you are up,1
teacher:Hudson are you being a distraction right now,1
teacher:Does that make sense;student:No,1
teacher:Missy;student:Missy,1
teacher:You and your partner are going to create number stories okay,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:So you have to match this picture to the multiplication number sentence okay,1
teacher:I would love to be able to hang them on the white board okay,1
teacher:All right any questions;student:Okay,1
teacher:Okay everybody has their cards correct,1
teacher:Roge;student:12 and 34 because this part,1
teacher:Pam pa ram pa;student:Im confused how do we match these,1
teacher:Did you match them all;student:Shoe sticks,1
teacher:Havent even matched two;student:No Im still matching,1
teacher:Did we practice fraction multiplication,1
teacher:Did we understand a couple of number stories;student:Yes we did,1
teacher:Six dollars of his allowance;student:We could use multiplication because 3 x 2  6 which is 23 of nine and that he spent six of his allowance,1
teacher:You guys done,1
teacher:So I want you each to try what you came up with and then I want a complete answer when you tell okay,1
teacher:Has everybody at the table talked,1
teacher:Does that work,1
teacher:Okay next up would be Marco,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Okay last but certainly not least Franc,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Thats a lot of cookies isnt it;student:How many cookies does his friend have,1
teacher:Could I divide in this instance;student:We do 78 56,1
teacher:Are you going to think about the amount of money from your monthly income that you can pay to make a car payment,1
teacher:Im not dividing anything Im only multiplying something right;student:Were not dividing,1
teacher:Okay did I give you your equal parts;student:Yes,1
teacher:Do you have a question,1
teacher:I would like person number three to start talking about this at their table please,1
teacher:Start the conversation,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Okay so then go backwards so that youre the last one remember;student:9 x 2  18,1
teacher:You believe you should subtract you believe you should divide you believe you should multiply okay,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Did we play around with real world contacts;student:Yes we did,1
teacher:Are you really going to be thinking about a carpeted area,1
teacher:Youve been solving fraction multiplication problems correct,1
teacher:Thats part of what I needed to figure out right;student:Of three,1
teacher:Do that one for me you got it;student:Roberto come on,1
teacher:Does that number match that number,1
teacher:Explain talk to one another,1
teacher:Kurt are all those equivalent fractions,1
teacher:Do I guess keep going up,1
teacher:Did my fraction ever change of what I was multiplying,1
teacher:Makes sense,1
teacher:If you are done stand up push chair in,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Whats going on;student:So youd know,1
teacher:When you are done you are to stand up,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:Buddy come on Robertos going first,1
teacher:If Im taking five and Im multiplying it by half right,1
teacher:Does that makes sense,1
teacher:Is that basically what it is,1
teacher:Youre saying youre doing 112 eight times right,1
teacher:So that one portion is worth three,1
teacher:You are going to get to do this and I am going to have you work with a partner okay,1
teacher:Portion A group A took all right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Should I see a box down here for a drawing,1
teacher:If I do it up here did I answer this one;student:The picture there,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:Makes sense,1
teacher:Do you understand what your job is,1
teacher:How are you feeling about this,1
teacher:That is where we struggle picking our partners and if my partner and I both are experts at this were not doing a whole lot of learning are we,1
teacher:How confident do you feel on this,1
teacher:Asher and Andrew is that what youre supposed to be doing right now,1
teacher:Arent you,1
teacher:So youre thinking of connecting the box,1
teacher:I dont want you to do that okay,1
teacher:What did you just say,1
teacher:We have a collection box down here and were going to start with looking at their process okay,1
teacher:Gabby;student:A whole,1
teacher:To one whole so isnt it like multiplying the fraction by one;student:One whole,1
teacher:Isnt it like that,1
teacher:So in your explanation you are going to write exactly what I tell you to write okay,1
teacher:Okay everybody ready for the rest,1
teacher:Okay does 2x412,1
teacher:Does 3x412;student:No,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:My questions are confusing so you know that 4x312 right,1
teacher:Is 912 equal to 34 everyone,1
teacher:Franc did you go over one and two with everyone,1
teacher:Franc instead of just sitting there what should you be doing,1
teacher:No were in math right now what should you be doing,1
teacher:Thats one whole isnt it,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:By drawing pictures like that  make sense,1
teacher:If you dont is it a bad thing Christoph,1
teacher:Were going to look at the next problem because this is where Im going to know if you understand why this works okay,1
teacher:You wrote this one incorrectly,1
teacher:Gregory what are you struggling on,1
teacher:Marco,1
teacher:equal one;student:Wow yes,1
teacher:Dont they,1
teacher:What are 3 fractions that are equivalent to one friends,1
teacher:Youre going to do a turnandtalk,1
teacher:Do a quick turnandtalk to your neighbors please,1
teacher:Gerogia,1
teacher:You know our math stories that we love so much,1
teacher:JulGabbya;student:Well they have to be the same because if they werent the same like say like four fifths that it will be close to a whole but not a whole,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:Everyone should be on 184 with your Gerogia are you ready,1
teacher:22 33 44 right,1
teacher:Are those the fractions you wrote Missy,1
teacher:Gerogia;student:If you multiply 45,1
teacher:Everybody got it;student:It would have to be 33 because we have to make the denominator,1
teacher:Everybody got them written down;student:For the denominator,1
teacher:Makes sense,1
teacher:Its greater,1
teacher:Now are you on your way to be able to write these stories,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:The way that I had it on the bottom 3 34 4 34 5 34 6 34 7 34 thats a little bit harder isnt it,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:What do you not understand,1
teacher:Because if these are going to be between 3 12 3 and 3 12 or 3 12 and 4 right;student:Because youre doing a 12 and you dont have to do 14 24 34 and everything,1
teacher:Camiela does that make sense to you;student:Yes,1
teacher:Are you sure;student:Yes,1
teacher:Does that make sense to everyone else,1
teacher:do we agree though that we should always go smallest to largest,1
teacher:Notice on a line plot do I have numbers that go up the side,1
teacher:Table group six youre going to start first;student:Yes,1
teacher:So five four three two one okay,1
teacher:Table group four please go;student:Okay,1
teacher:Table group two,1
teacher:Table group one,1
teacher:If I am doing data using axes like we talked about shouldnt my data look like this when its up on the board,1
teacher:Thats easier to chart isnt it,1
teacher:Theres 7 so that would be 6 34 and 6 14 is my data,1
teacher:Could I do that;student:Yes,1
teacher:Would that be a more efficient way to do it;student:Yes,1
teacher:Stand when you think youve got it;student:I think the end number,1
teacher:Stand when you think youve got it,1
teacher:Stand when you think youve got it,1
teacher:Im sorry what;student:I got 3 through 15 because,1
teacher:Is that what you guys are going to do,1
teacher:So would that mean I go 4 12 4 34 5 and so on,1
teacher:So I went 3 4 5 6 7 34,1
teacher:Thats what you did,1
teacher:Oh so you did 3 and then 3 14 and then 4 and 4 14 right;student:We did 3 and then 3 14 then 3 24,1
teacher:Am I doing this the way you did it,1
teacher:Am I really going to want to graph something that big,1
teacher:Because if I start here and that is 4 24 thats 4 12 I could put it right here couldnt I,1
teacher:So now looking at the way I did it Im not going to go 14 24 34 44 am I,1
teacher:Could I,1
teacher:Could I do that;student:Yes you could,1
teacher:But could I;student:No,1
teacher:Is my data easier to read that way;student:It looks like too bad,1
teacher:Than the way you all did it;student:Yes,1
teacher:or a plot goes up right;student:A plot goes that way,1
teacher:Franc ready,1
teacher:Vicki,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:19;student:I got 19,1
teacher:Matty,1
teacher:Gabby did you hear that;student:Because  fraction is just getting smaller and smaller,1
teacher:Explain that again,1
teacher:Do you remember learning that with fractions,1
teacher:570 seconds;student:Yes it would because it would be 5 and 72,1
teacher:but 910  910 is not equal to is it;student:Its equal to,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:When youve got it stand up and push your chair,1
teacher:Stand up when you are done,1
teacher:I would like you to discuss it with your partner,1
teacher:I would like the person closest to the floor to go first,1
teacher:Clay Rebecca are we ready,1
teacher:Are we ready,1
teacher:Sit down once youre done;student:I know its going to be difficult for you,1
teacher:58 12;student:58 12,1
teacher:Very right;student:Very,1
teacher:Pencil right,1
teacher:Is that an easier way to do it;student:Like you put it on top a little more,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:The one all the way at the top that I didnt use remember;student:Oh the,1
teacher:Good number to end with or I mean could I have started with 3 12,1
teacher:Its easier to do it in 12 isnt it,1
teacher:Talk with one another,1
teacher:Miss Kayla would you stand up here please,1
teacher:You tell me;student:60,1
teacher:The smallest is 52 12 and the largest is 66 12,1
teacher:Should I do 52 12 and 55,1
teacher:Am I going to make it,1
teacher:Is that going to work,1
teacher:You think,1
teacher:Hes taller than that right;student:he was taller than that,1
teacher:We are measuring fifth graders all right,1
teacher:On your way,1
teacher:Youre just going to quickly look and then come back to your table and talk right,1
teacher:Sit down when you are done,1
teacher:Do I automatically now know by looking at this that its less than,1
teacher:Its less than 3;student:Yes,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Which comes out to be bigger than the 78 right;student:I did 7 x 3 is 21 and then 8,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Brady and Georgia please stand,1
teacher:12 so do you see friends;student:12,1
teacher:All right makes sense,1
teacher:Georgia makes sense,1
teacher:Friends with your thumbs that were down or up does this make sense,1
teacher:Do you need to know that information,1
teacher:Gabby Im going to haveFranc start explaining,1
teacher:Are you done,1
teacher:Okay goahead,1
teacher:And 8 right,1
teacher:If our learning objective is to divide and if I know I need to be able to justify what the difference in these two things are am I gonna work on division;student:Yes,1
teacher:So we have 78 x 3 correct,1
teacher:Okay go ahead,1
teacher:What;student:Miss  comes to,1
teacher:Did you talk about dividing fractions yesterday,1
teacher:Okay so you got your introduction to dividing fractions and it was pretty easy wasnt it;student:Yes,1
teacher:Turn and talk at your table,1
teacher:Yes sir,1
teacher:You wouldnt write it like that would you,1
teacher:Were going to erase these I just gave you that as a visual okay,1
teacher:Makes sense,1
teacher:Thumbs up thumbs down okay,1
teacher:I am going to show you these problems and I want you to give me a thumbs up if the product is greater than 78 and a thumbs down if the product is less than 78 and a thumb to the side if its equal to 78 okay,1
teacher:Roberto Im going to have you because you disagreed with Gabby so Im going to have you because you had a thumbs down am I correct,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:Who had a thumbs down,1
teacher:Please stand,1
teacher:Kayla go ahead,1
teacher:Lets think about this okay,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:You did this yesterday,1
teacher:Okay ready,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Got them Theo;student:Okay,1
teacher:Up here you will divide real quick,1
teacher:Remember youre going to use a letter for your answer okay;student:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20,1
teacher:I agree that 6 divided by 13 equal whatever letter you gave it okay,1
teacher:This number has to be the same this letter has to be the same when Im doing it as a multiplication problem only mistake you made okay,1
teacher:Did you cover anything in;student:Its fun though,1
teacher:Are you done,1
teacher:Everybody got their model,1
teacher:I need this this is what I expect to see okay,1
teacher:Everybody understand that,1
teacher:Okay if I have 183 meter pieces of yarn is that correct,1
teacher:Six does that make sense,1
teacher:Is everybody ready,1
teacher:Sit down when you are done sorry,1
teacher:M for Anja okay,1
teacher:Fred,1
teacher:Maggie do you want to work with me,1
teacher:Makes sense,1
teacher:Because can we help,1
teacher:Then if youre justifying your thinking can we help where you might have had a misconception,1
teacher:Because thats what it is its all about misconceptions okay;student:Yes,1
teacher:So come on up,1
teacher:Im going to let Asher go first,1
teacher:Im going to have Donte come up;student:I got nine halves because 1  1  2 and then I did 12  12 equals a whole and so I added them together I think 3 6 and 19,1
teacher:So you think they would have 32 yards;student:I made a number line and then I know I had  so I put it up to three and I did halves and that three,1
teacher:Everybody has a sticky note up there right,1
teacher:I would like Elinor and Roge to come up here,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Estello,1
teacher:What sweetie,1
teacher:Makes sense,1
teacher:All right so makes sense,1
teacher:Asher you understand what you were doing;student:Yes,1
teacher:Heres what you couldve done that would have made this easier because you knew that you had three yards right,1
teacher:Elinor and Roge,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Did that help,1
teacher:Thumb up if you got 204 for your answer;student:I added them and I got 204,1
teacher:Is that a very interesting histogram,1
teacher:Could you go like this and count off by ones,1
teacher:Are you accusing me of making a mistake;student:Im guessing the answer is wrong,1
teacher:Ready to do all of them,1
teacher:A single  Are we good on all of them,1
teacher:Are we good on all of them;student:Three,1
teacher:All 11,1
teacher:All 11,1
teacher:Are we good on all 11 of them,1
teacher:You good on all 11;student:Yes I havent done the ACT ones,1
teacher:Are we good on all 11,1
teacher:You guys collaborated on this,1
teacher:Who is that,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:James come on down,1
teacher:Do you get different shapes depending on what you count by,1
teacher:All right so that one is one that Im assuming more than 74 of you guys knows how to calculate a mean right,1
teacher:Could I have counted by fives,1
teacher:Over here,1
teacher:Is it a true statement to say that theyre the same because they both have bars,1
teacher:You mean theyre right up next to each other,1
teacher:Theyre touching each other like that,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Oh height of the bar;student:It looks like you probably have to use height to show data,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:The histogram doesnt use all of the numbers,1
teacher:Whats on your page;student:I cant see that,1
teacher:Oh so for histogram were going to get mean mode and those kind of things;student:The one on the right seems like mean and mode and whatnot,1
teacher:She said one is sectioned and has words down here like basketball gymnastics right,1
teacher:If I said right now I went around and did this and I said  Celeste whats your favorite color,1
teacher:Whats your favorite color;student:Black,1
teacher:Whats your favorite color,1
teacher:All right youre ready to make a couple,1
teacher:Okay did I make a horizontal axis,1
teacher:Heres the thing did I have to count by tens right here,1
teacher:Median doesnt mean anything unless you put them in order from smallest to biggest first right;student:Order,1
teacher:Amazing right,1
teacher:Find xintercept we said top equal to zero right,1
teacher:Horizontal right,1
teacher:Find the six key things and then try to see if you could do that sketching and graph and then do six a and b exactly the way that the directions want you to do it in the book okay,1
teacher:Huh;student:I was trying to get these,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Shut up;student:Shut up and then like,1
teacher:The main error was the negative two  or you could say x  or you could say all real numbers except  okay,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Were going to have a  right,1
teacher:When I said where does it cross the yaxis you said never right,1
teacher:you said its x0 which is the yaxis so those two things confirm each other right,1
teacher:You guys going to do it okay,1
teacher:Sir;student:Yes sir,1
teacher:Is evertyhing good,1
teacher:Are we ready to do this or you need another minute;student:Its really hot in here,1
teacher:The other one is sort of a what do you remember from Math III problem,1
teacher:Were concerned about what happens on the end right,1
teacher:Now a big confusion that people have sometimes in this unit when we get into more difficult ones does that mean it can never cross this ever ever ever,1
teacher:Say assymp,1
teacher:Asymtotetote okay,1
teacher:This was a possibility right,1
teacher:How many people got that,1
teacher:When we are doing an xintercept we are trying to say it hits right there at that dot so we write it as an ordered pair right,1
teacher:To multiply to get a 4 and combine and get a 3 we would have to go down four up one and so that does not cancel there but thats a got you on the test if you cant factor because you might think that thats an x1 right,1
teacher:That is a xintercept of 20 right,1
teacher:Thats the only one right,1
teacher:Could I have also gone over here and been like Oh it appears to have a vertical asymptote at x  4 and then narrow it down by the denominator,1
teacher:When you make a histogram do you make bars to make the histogram;student:I know,1
teacher:You guys feeling good about multiple choice,1
teacher:No we factor first right;student:Yes,1
teacher:Is that factorable,1
teacher:Are you becoming a factoring master,1
teacher:Youre pretty much guaranteed that stuff is going to cancel right,1
teacher:I know that the x coordinate of the whole was x  1 right,1
teacher:Somewhat like the blue maybe stepped up a couple of notches in there so make sure youre keeping up with everything that we are doing right,1
teacher:Tomorrow were going to talk a lot about why this stuff works but for right now were just going to hit what are the rules for asymptotes okay,1
teacher:Is that the first thing you do on the problems unit,1
teacher:Devon,1
teacher:No rectangles right,1
teacher:What are you saying,1
teacher:Wheres your white sheet,1
teacher:Do you have a one,1
teacher:28 and you have 15;student:Yes,1
teacher:You guys good,1
teacher:Are you guys good,1
teacher:You guys doing okay,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:When you do the arm length data make sure you put in the new data that we have with Maria and who else,1
teacher:Did you add them all;student:Done,1
teacher:Are you guys getting your work done,1
teacher:Are you sure the median is 105,1
teacher:Next week are we going to all participate,1
teacher:Can everybody in here do all 10 of those things,1
teacher:Can everybody do a box and whisker plot,1
teacher:All weve done is been able to say whether the percentages of each of those chunks be normal of the box and whisker plot okay,1
teacher:All right how are we doing over here,1
teacher:Has anybody ever done that in math before,1
teacher:Adriana are you good from this page now,1
teacher:All right you know what to do;student:She,1
teacher:24 gets stacked This isnt a very interesting histogram yet is it,1
teacher:Is that bothering you,1
teacher:Wait passed through it on the ground or in the air,1
teacher:What if you just drove through the State does that count,1
teacher:Yes;student:Hey mister,1
teacher:Were you at all four States at the same time;student:I went to the fourth corner,1
teacher:Oh really,1
teacher:Colorado,1
teacher:Guess what,1
teacher:You want to go to the data,1
teacher:Whats that;student:Yes,1
teacher:Is this the screen you want me to leave it on,1
teacher:Dont forget though get some IXL action going on today at some point okay,1
teacher:Well if youre a freshman it means youre going to turn 14 right;student:Do you know what year though,1
teacher:That means it would have been 14 years ago so 2006;student:Yes,1
teacher:You wrote it down on your white paper right;student:You have it on your paper,1
teacher:Has anybody ever talked about a histogram before,1
teacher:How many people actually did their box and whisker plot yesterday or last night for homework,1
teacher:Well its something that you do  right;student:It was homework,1
teacher:What about you guys,1
teacher:Fatina,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Alley,1
teacher:Last years minimum height was smaller than this years minimum height right;student:Last years minimum height was smaller than this years minimum height,1
teacher:Should we go find Jeanie and remeasure her,1
teacher:Who thinks that their class was taller on average,1
teacher:Okay somebody who thinks this years class is taller,1
teacher:Our middle person was 171 right;student:Just look at the median and figure out the difference between,1
teacher:History and graphing put together;student:History and graph put together,1
teacher:Is a histogram have anything to do with history,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Talk,1
teacher:Are you guys actually writing down,1
teacher:You don t have what;student:I don t know how to do that,1
teacher:You havent come up with one yet,1
teacher:If we lined last years class up from the smallest kid to the biggest kid will there be more of a difference between the shortest and the tallestSthan this year;student:Yes,1
teacher:If you look at how far spread out the data is is last years data way more spread out,1
teacher:Do that with your hands again,1
teacher:This is the same stuff,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Okay how about like that for right now,1
teacher:I want you to say as a team two intelligent things that you can say about how those two things compare all right,1
teacher:Kumar go ahead,1
teacher:Kumar say it again,1
teacher:This was Zoe right;student:The 192 and 142 is higher apart from the 159 167 or something,1
teacher:When you make a bar graph do you use bars to make a bar graph,1
teacher:Do you think Zoe was an outlier;student:Yes it was probably,1
teacher:For right now do you think Zoe maybe is an outlier;student:Very weird,1
teacher:Maybe;student:No,1
teacher:This was Jeanie right,1
teacher:Do you think Jeanie was an outlier;student:Yes,1
teacher:Youre the tallest person in here do you think youre an outlier,1
teacher:Is Cooper weird enough compared to the rest of the data to be considered an outlier;student:No,1
teacher:Is his whisker thats way out here far enough away from the rest of the stuff;student:No,1
teacher:Is he far enough away from the data to be considered weird;student:Yes,1
teacher:20 to 30 right,1
teacher:You can pick which one you want to do number one or number two,1
teacher:This one or,1
teacher:Remember the list of steps youd have to take to the standard deviation by hand which is why I taught you how to use your calculator to do it,1
teacher:Then would you use that to be able to do this without having the calculator,1
teacher:Everythings the same;student:Theyre the same,1
teacher:All of them,1
teacher:Because of the way this worked this doesnt always happen but with this set of data the mean the median and the mode were all 50 right,1
teacher:The goal is could you have predicted this without putting it into your calculator based on the story,1
teacher:They should scoot up by 10 right,1
teacher:Go ahead sir you say it first,1
teacher:Can you say it again a little louder,1
teacher:Can I summarize what you said,1
teacher:Did my hands get further apart,1
teacher:Did I increase the spread,1
teacher:When they doubled their scores ladies When they doubled their scores ladies when they doubled their scores did the mean of their data double,1
teacher:Did the median double;student:Yes,1
teacher:Did the mode double,1
teacher:Mr Strathom Come on,1
teacher:Those all did this but did these do that,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:The test is on Friday right,1
teacher:The thing is you doing it out of order right,1
teacher:What does this say,1
teacher:It couldn t possibly be mistake,1
teacher:Just a straight line because there s no just continuities  in the denominator other than a hole right;student:And that is just,1
teacher:Hey are you guys doing what I asked you to do right now,1
teacher:Is there anything wrong with this;student:In 1999 it was,1
teacher:Is there anything wrong with that,1
teacher:Is there anything misleading about it,1
teacher:By 2000;student:By 2000,1
teacher:2000;student:Wait,1
teacher:No we dont know why right;student:But why,1
teacher:Is there anything misleading about it,1
teacher:Is there any information this is conveying to you thats not accurate,1
teacher:Is there anything misleading or weird about this graph;student:It shows the increase of the average house pricing from 1998 to 1999,1
teacher:It looks like it right;student:increase,1
teacher:TheSwho got a 35 went up to a 45 so basically each of these went up by 10 right,1
teacher:Did they spread out,1
teacher:Did they move up,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Is that going to make you rich,1
teacher:Who has it;student:Its not equal,1
teacher:First off is there a similar problem over here,1
teacher:Starting out at 10 instead of zero is that a similar problem,1
teacher:Can you do that if you could make a histogram,1
teacher:Can you do that,1
teacher:Can you count it like that,1
teacher:Is this thing a linear decrease,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:Whats that,1
teacher:If I gave you a picture of a graph would you be able to answer the question what is the domain of that graph,1
teacher:Domain is legal x s right;student:Yes,1
teacher:As I go across this thing and I m looking for legal x s are all of the x s allowed to be put into this function,1
teacher:Actually now that I think about it you can also do x  3 or 3  x  5 or x  5 too right,1
teacher:What;student:You said less than five,1
teacher:Can you do that,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Can they do that,1
teacher:They went up by,1
teacher:Youre just figuring that out,1
teacher:Youre ready,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:What did he say,1
teacher:Is that a big increase,1
teacher:2000 is a lot of money but is it as big as it looks like on this graph;student:8200000,1
teacher:I want to see arrows at the end of things all right;student:That looks worse,1
teacher:Did the home prices really triple,1
teacher:Did they lie to you by making this claim,1
teacher:Is there an increase in tuition,1
teacher:Is it similar to what I just did in home prices,1
teacher:what are you talking about,1
teacher:Did it increase,1
teacher:If you went from about 16500 to about 18200 is that really times two,1
teacher:Is it okay if they do that,1
teacher:If you looked at these two lines would you say Oh my gosh the second line got way bigger,1
teacher:Which one do you want to do,1
teacher:I want to see approaching passing through and approaching okay,1
teacher:Is this supposed to be going away from that asymptote like that;student:The line has to be part of that,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Would a trillionaire ever stop to pick up seven bucks on the ground,1
teacher:The point is youre Jeff Bezos do you care about seven bucks or nine bucks,1
teacher:That makes sense,1
teacher:Yes sir;student:Yes,1
teacher:If you plugged a trillion in does this matter,1
teacher:This doesnt matter but do those two things matter,1
teacher:If you have this guy winning and nothing else matters because this is so big compared to everything else then are you going to flatten out like that,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:What are what;student:What,1
teacher:Howre you doing,1
teacher:Questions,1
teacher:Concerns,1
teacher:Complaints,1
teacher:Everything all right out there,1
teacher:Do you need to write anything up here to support words coming out of your mouth,1
teacher:39 right,1
teacher:Lets go,1
teacher:Talk and communicate please,1
teacher:You want a poll of the class and see if they agree with you or not;student:I said it could be,1
teacher:Might be misunderstanding that kind of stuff;student:When you associate the top of a roller coaster if you think of something like that,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Did you pick C;student:I looked between C and E and then I got to a conclusion that it was all squared that has to be squared so I tried 182 and got,1
teacher:Look you guys are not going to remember every math fact that you learned in school when you take the SAT right,1
teacher:Everywhere that you are at on the circle you could go in and drop in a little right triangle right,1
teacher:Correct,1
teacher:As you go around here could you see that triangle changing and your X growing and shrinking as your Y grows and shrinks,1
teacher:Thats the Pythagorean Theorem right,1
teacher:Half of 18 is nine 92is Makes sense,1
teacher:Got it,1
teacher:Should you always be checking whats happening in here around zero,1
teacher:Start talking,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:The only bad thin to do right now would be ignore the task okay,1
teacher:Is that right,1
teacher:You can get to that answer but this is the thing that youre going to need to be able to  on the test makes sense,1
teacher:Dont forget when you get done with your pumps thats due Friday you have this thats due tomorrow and you have a quiz coming okay,1
teacher:Who wants to volunteer for this one,1
teacher:Come on Lucas;student:Ill do it,1
teacher:Oh we talked about that Friday right,1
teacher:Out here and out here right,1
teacher:Is it legal,1
teacher:You can cross the horizontal asymptote right;student:Yes,1
teacher:You failed the function test right;student:No,1
teacher:All right who wants to volunteer to do this one;student:It s all,1
teacher:Adam,1
teacher:The asymptote right;student:The oblique,1
teacher:Who wants to volunteer,1
teacher:This guy and this guy had the exact same vertical and oblique asymptote right,1
teacher:You think Im doing this enough to get the point across,1
teacher:That that is a common mistake,1
teacher:A dozen more times;student:I think you need to do that a dozen more times,1
teacher:Its not a function right;student:The vertical line and the X would be Thered be no line across the axis,1
teacher:Can we do this by volunteering,1
teacher:You got the logical reasoning there,1
teacher:Or you need to use it for a while,1
teacher:How confident do you guys feel on these four skills,1
teacher:Any questions you have for me,1
teacher:What are you doing;student:I had c2,1
teacher:How confident do you guys feel in this ish iffy,1
teacher:Holden;student:Thank you,1
teacher:Which one do you want to do,1
teacher:That one;student:That was easy,1
teacher:Is this coming back down now towards;student:It has to cross the X because theres a dot right there so I hypothesize the line comes up and goes along here like that,1
teacher:Does anyone have any little picky little detail thats bugging them about that,1
teacher:Coin flip;student:I crossed that one out and then math never gives things to you this nicely so I crossed one out and between these two I guessed  Educated guess,1
teacher:Is this building your confidence for how good youre going to be able to do on the SATs;student:Youre lucky,1
teacher:Who just said that,1
teacher:Who just said  I m,1
teacher:Can you figure out how to draw the rational function once youve gotten the information from the quiz the peak quiz tells you these things right,1
teacher:The math for beyond that is can you find out where it lives,1
teacher:Today feels better right,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Sawyer do you want to share maybe and maybe you did the same thing,1
teacher:Do you know that that bar represented 37,1
teacher:Can I have you guys come on up,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Someone else for my group,1
teacher:Logan can you have a seat,1
teacher:Did anybody do that,1
teacher:Did you show what actually could work,1
teacher:Did you write it down,1
teacher:You think so,1
teacher:Remember how we revised our thinking is that we cant do 12 plus 13 plus 13,1
teacher:Logan can I see those circles,1
teacher:Did you just turn them upright,1
teacher:Anybody,1
teacher:Owen come on up,1
teacher:Well one daughter will Is it clear shes going to keep half,1
teacher:Sebastian,1
teacher:Is 13 plus 15 less than 12;student:13,1
teacher:Olivia,1
teacher:What do you guys think,1
teacher:Anybody hear a key word there,1
teacher:Would you mind coming up and sharing and then later were going to show what we discovered with Mia okay,1
teacher:Hudson,1
teacher:Dan,1
teacher:Is it 810 plus 20100,1
teacher:For 100s,1
teacher:Stand up if you like making the denominator 10s by dividing,1
teacher:They made the same thing right,1
teacher:510 plus 27100 okay,1
teacher:Does this look familiar,1
teacher:Is it easy to add now that you have 40100 and 32100,1
teacher:We are having this impression about  okay,1
teacher:I want to talk about this problem okay,1
teacher:We want to revise our thinking but were going to need someone writing  share and thinking about how it  our problem okay,1
teacher:Can someone read number one,1
teacher:Ms Tolliver Lets just start with Logan,1
teacher:Is that less than the other two,1
teacher:Raise your hands if you got them out when you did this problem,1
teacher:Can I add those up,1
teacher:Do you see how that wouldnt work,1
teacher:Does this work,1
teacher:All these friends you had it exactly like we talked about all the friends sitting on the carpet,1
teacher:Everything was perfect,1
teacher:Do you guys remember benchmark fractions,1
teacher:Is Suma right,1
teacher:Is angle B larger than A,1
teacher:Now youre going to turn and talk to a neighbor,1
teacher:Who is 12,1
teacher:I think thats Steven are you 12,1
teacher:Anybody want to share,1
teacher:Ava,1
teacher:Stand by your desk and show youre ready to look,1
teacher:Do you see the second hand moving,1
teacher:Okay so everybody understands clockwise and counterclockwise,1
teacher:Try and talk to your groups,1
teacher:Beep beep beep beep beep,1
teacher:Stand up if you got that,1
teacher:Tell me if this works,1
teacher:Okay come on over;student:Yes,1
teacher:Lucas did you write it down on your paper,1
teacher:Does that work,1
teacher:How many of you have some new thinking at the moment,1
teacher:Whats the hardest thing about that three daughters sharing 12,1
teacher:Logan,1
teacher:The other two would get 16;student:I thought that they would get 16,1
teacher:Youre saying one gets 13 and then the other two get 16;student:Yes,1
teacher:Youre confused;student:No Im confused,1
teacher:Did you use 10 as the denominator,1
teacher:You want this;student:No because I wanted both of them here,1
teacher:Well does this work;student:Maybe instead of you doing Where did you,1
teacher:It doesnt really You can clearly see it doesnt work right;student:Because this isnt,1
teacher:Did you get that somewhere;student:I tried a couple of different things  it will get 12 because turning your fraction into equivalent,1
teacher:30;student:I used 30,1
teacher:Come on up,1
teacher:Is this right,1
teacher:Is 1630 equal to 12,1
teacher:Does that anymore;student:Yes,1
teacher:Can Asher do a 360 on a skateboard,1
teacher:Can you try it both ways,1
teacher:Is that the same;student:9,1
teacher:Does anybody want to Actually show me from a one to a four how you feel about coming from a mixed number to an improper fraction,1
teacher:Did anybody revise their thinking,1
teacher:Anybody,1
teacher:Does anybody here understand what a mixed number is,1
teacher:did you have an answer,1
teacher:Stand up and say to your partner about exactly the same thing,1
teacher:Anybody,1
teacher:Do I have a friend,1
teacher:Lauren said she would like to share,1
teacher:Awesome do you want to share,1
teacher:She said I mark the denominator is that what youre saying,1
teacher:Elijah,1
teacher:Silas,1
teacher:Five right,1
teacher:Austin do you want to come up,1
teacher:Luis and then Austin Luis can you come on up,1
teacher:Nick ready to come up and share what you have and then well compare and talk about how we actually add mixed fractions,1
teacher:Anybody,1
teacher:Share with a neighbor,1
teacher:Right now I want you to share with a partner,1
teacher:Can you guys both come up;student:Ella and,1
teacher:How much money can Mr Swanson take to the store so you said 304,1
teacher:I see the word estimate here,1
teacher:Is that what you did;student:Instead of going to 640 he could have just gone to 610 and that would have been easier 610 instead of 640,1
teacher:Stand up if you got 608 for your answer,1
teacher:We are going to look now how many of you are Well I dont even know what the answer is,1
teacher:The first part the price of twoset of strings one one set would be 8 4 times 2 and then times 2 so that will be 16 okay,1
teacher:They are showing that just like Jaden did you can do an estimate okay,1
teacher:Did anyone else get close to 400,1
teacher:Anybody,1
teacher:Stand up if you got 304 for your answer,1
teacher:The multiple steps okay,1
teacher:Can you convert two and one fourth to make an improper fraction,1
teacher:Can you show that the picture to two and one fourth and come up with an improper fraction and then well talk about it,1
teacher:Do I have a friend who would be willing to share,1
teacher:All right Nicks going to share with you,1
teacher:Stand up if you got sevenfifths,1
teacher:Okay listen to what the next  Elena,1
teacher:Dylan,1
teacher:Could I add these together,1
teacher:If I have 20 pennies or 2 dimes is it the same,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Most of you youve got Number 2,1
teacher:Some of you got to Number 3 and Number 4,1
teacher:Sofia,1
teacher:Is either answer acceptable,1
teacher:John could you write it like this;student:I did 3 x 10 and then I got 30 and then I added the other to 90100 and then I got 1 and 20100,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you wrote it like that;student:Yes,1
teacher:Do you always have to go and make the 100 the denominator,1
teacher:Turn and talk to your neighbor;student:No,1
teacher:Turn and talk to a neighbor,1
teacher:Stand up,1
teacher:Stand up if you think you could actually make it 10,1
teacher:You have decided if Im doing this was it 45100,1
teacher:Ms Tolliver Raise your hand if you can revise your thinking a little bit,1
teacher:Whos is this,1
teacher:If theres a 10 and 100 can I add the numerators,1
teacher:Can you share what you did,1
teacher:Is this what youre thinking,1
teacher:Do you have an equation written down,1
teacher:Is it okay if I add something just to show the class,1
teacher:Stand up if this is what you also got,1
teacher:Can everybody look up this way,1
teacher:Did anybody do that,1
teacher:If I have 9 dimes or 90 pennies is it the same;student:Yes,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:A nice gentleman tell us what page were on,1
teacher:Ms Tolliver Some of you have an answer,1
teacher:I would like Stella and Dylan can you both come up,1
teacher:Then can you put yours under,1
teacher:Can we talk to a neighbor,1
teacher:Can you share,1
teacher:Can I pause you right there;student:You have to turn this into hundredths which,1
teacher:How are you,1
teacher:Ryan can you go ahead and bring yours up,1
teacher:Im going to be handing every partnerpair one of these and together Ill say You know what,1
teacher:Does everybody notice how its moving this way,1
teacher:You told me what the area of the Turn and talk to a partner;student:It was,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Show me with your fingers how you feel about your understanding,1
teacher:You knew about  when you divide it you knew you  Is there anything else,1
teacher:Can I have a partnerpair,1
teacher:Who wants to share first,1
teacher:Thumbs up if you got 80;student:Then I added the zero on the next one  nine divided by 728,1
teacher:Ryan,1
teacher:Did you guys talk about what we were doing today,1
teacher:Or did you do some revising of your thinking,1
teacher:When you look at this did everybody have a rectangle of 720,1
teacher:If we know the area already remember how lengthwidth would be the area,1
teacher:Audrey,1
teacher:So the dividend everybody say dividend;student:When you divide the bigger number youre supposed to,1
teacher:Does this make sense,1
teacher:Who remembers what I said about division,1
teacher:Show with your fingers from a one to four how you feel about finding the missing sides of rectangles when given the area,1
teacher:Sebastian,1
teacher:Dan,1
teacher:If you can multiply and you have two examples you can do this show me with your fingers,1
teacher:I want everyone to show me,1
teacher:Did you guys listen to what friends shared and you understand what the chart means,1
teacher:Does everybody understand how to do that,1
teacher:Do you understand it Juliale,1
teacher:Were going to start off today with a math message that I want you to try out okay,1
teacher:Were doing an inquiry where youre going to figure this out and then I want you to go and explain how you did it and can you apply that rule to other things,1
teacher:Can someone read this out loud for me,1
teacher:Julia,1
teacher:Sebastian,1
teacher:Liam,1
teacher:Are you going to draw a rectangle 450 feet with an area or 9 feet long,1
teacher:Haley would you like to come up and share,1
teacher:You said you drew a rectangle right,1
teacher:Area,1
teacher:Can you repeat again nice and loud what you said,1
teacher:Can I have all eyes up here to show youre really listening because Im only going to be talking for like two minutes are all eyes up there,1
teacher:We want to have a mathematical conversation today does that make sense,1
teacher:Okay so can you see if you can find your mistake do you think theres a mistake;student:87,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Your eyes should be up there what are you doing,1
teacher:Read with me,1
teacher:Can you show the answer two to three different ways,1
teacher:I dont see any models Im looking for some models can you model this can you show it with a picture as the equations,1
teacher:You are going to compare your answers I want you to compare your answer to your partners then I want you to come to a consensus did you show the same model did you revise in your thinking,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Do you think it might be able to  with colors;student:So I did my number model and I wasnt sure what type of model I was going to do so I did this first so I can get my answer and know that I could do my model and get the right answer so I do my two and 18 and I subtracted my one and 58 I subtracted by four then five,1
teacher:Anyone,1
teacher:Did everybody get 48,1
teacher:Were going to look at number one can I have someone read that nice and loud,1
teacher:This is,1
teacher:Shamila can  can you please read that,1
teacher:Youre going to share compare to yours and then maybe do some revision of your thinking all right,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Is it similar to how I did or is it different,1
teacher:All right can I have Dylan,1
teacher:Okay and so how about I give you guys a couple of minutes to add on and the only thing Owen that might so you get the division but over here when it shows show or explain your thinking can you do a little explanation to go with it;student:My explanation,1
teacher:What;student:No,1
teacher:17;student:I got 17 or maybe,1
teacher:To rephrase what you said okay so two had six and the rest had five so you took just 17 and those two extra oranges you put one and one is that what youre saying in one and the other;student:It says if you didnt  some baskets are 17 and theres any extra  plus five so I took two out of the 17 or put one in each so the two of them are 16 and 15 in each one,1
teacher:So Victoria you did some revised thinking here right,1
teacher:What does it state right here,1
teacher:If there are any extra after each basket has five you can add to the other baskets,1
teacher:Do you see how Owen with his two he put one in one to make six and another one in another one to make six,1
teacher:You spread them out in the bags that you already had;student:We spread them out,1
teacher:After looking at those how do you feel about multiple youre using multiplication and creating the equations,1
teacher:Now you know were getting the answer right;student:I said there will be 15 baskets,1
teacher:If you look at the boxes now that you have 17 baskets right,1
teacher:Could you divide out the 17 baskets if seven go in each box,1
teacher:Are you saying you would need three boxes,1
teacher:Would that third box be full;student:Yes,1
teacher:Its not full right,1
teacher:Is that kind of what you explained at the bottom,1
teacher:Understanding that so do you guys have some thinking to revise a little bit,1
teacher:The equation right;student:The second,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Good does everybody understand this part;student:explain their answers I figured out that you have to add the hours,1
teacher:Stand up with about 852 on that one;student:852,1
teacher:Well is this a right angle;student:Because it doesnt really look like a right angle,1
teacher:Olivia,1
teacher:Clockwise,1
teacher:Counterclockwise;student:Clockwise,1
teacher:Youre going to figure out what piece fits in there and then youre going to try the next pieces okay,1
teacher:Turn and talk to a neighbor,1
teacher:Can anybody restate what she just said,1
teacher:What did she say Logan,1
teacher:The arc;student:Its like that thing where its going,1
teacher:Sebastian,1
teacher:Its bigger okay;student:Its an obtuse,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Turn and talk to a neighbor,1
teacher:How about Hudson,1
teacher:Anyone want to add on to that or share what theyre thinking is,1
teacher:What did he say Zoe,1
teacher:Anyone,1
teacher:Or who can summarize actually what did Dan say,1
teacher:Can we tell what kind of angle this is,1
teacher:Can I have my VIP,1
teacher:Wholl read the first one,1
teacher:Victoria can you come up and share,1
teacher:Lily,1
teacher:Can you come up and show us,1
teacher:Its not a complete circle is it;student:Nothing can fit in,1
teacher:So if it were a complete circle could we fit that in there,1
teacher:I didnt really revise my thinking anybody else on that one,1
teacher:Annabelle,1
teacher:Were you;student:Well I was revising my thinking,1
teacher:Who thinks they can share the next one,1
teacher:Owen,1
teacher:What if you use the yellow one,1
teacher:Turn and talk to a neighbor,1
teacher:Who just had it up here with a piece,1
teacher:Dan,1
teacher:Riley,1
teacher:How many of you had to do a couple of steps to even attempt to solve these problems,1
teacher:If this was hard for you and you dont know if youve got it how might you feel coming or bringing this under the dock camera,1
teacher:For the singing;student:I did 63X3,1
teacher:Would that work,1
teacher:Would it be possible to keep it as three,1
teacher:Could you still do it easily in your head;student:Yes,1
teacher:Can everybody do that in their heads,1
teacher:Can we do something like this,1
teacher:Can everybody do 20X20,1
teacher:Youre really looking at how can I make it easier to do in my head;student:Yes,1
teacher:Now show me with your fingers is it making more sense,1
teacher:Can I have a friend read that out loud Julia can you please read it,1
teacher:can you come and share,1
teacher:Can we label the sandwiches;student:For the sandwiches,1
teacher:Did you add these two numbers;student:Then I did 100 andthen I added wait,1
teacher:Are you doing a little revising right now;student:Because,1
teacher:How much a package cost,1
teacher:Who can share,1
teacher:Are they like turn around fast;student:Because theyre basically the same number we just did a different order,1
teacher:Turn and talk to your neighbor,1
teacher:Does it matter which way that you multiply that,1
teacher:Julia,1
teacher:Can I have number Whos number 27,1
teacher:You are;student:I am,1
teacher:What does the question say,1
teacher:Anyone want to share,1
teacher:Riley come on up,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Was anyone thinking something at the beginning but now you realized what Sebastian do you want to share,1
teacher:Did you do the same thing for the other one,1
teacher:Stand up if you got 528 for that first equation,1
teacher:Sebastian can you come up,1
teacher:Owen,1
teacher:Do you think youd be at the times three,1
teacher:Tap on your shoulder if you need the times three the three hours,1
teacher:Does it equal the same thing,1
teacher:Turn and talk to your neighbor does this equal the same thing,1
teacher:Dylan,1
teacher:I said  5,1
teacher:Now I need to represent my 25 right,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Oh sometimes you miss a step;student:Yes,1
teacher:Really are there a lot of steps though,1
teacher:Do you want to try another one,1
teacher:Talk in your table if you have to talk to your table for a table;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:Talk  table,1
teacher:Do you think we have some answers;student:I multiplied 3  2 which is 6 and then I did 3  1 which is 3 and then I added then I got 56 and its probably not even,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:Eli,1
teacher:Right here;student:I did 3 1  3  3,1
teacher:Do you see where your mistake is;student:Well I got 46,1
teacher:Can you show me a thumb on how you feel about adding when our denominators are different;student:Yes,1
teacher:Does that change our steps,1
teacher:Yes;student:Kind of,1
teacher:Not that much,1
teacher:When our denominators get tricky making that change;student:I think trying to figure out what times four because we usually do the half of the denominator,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you think it changes our steps,1
teacher:Is that all of you;student:Three times three,1
teacher:Xavier,1
teacher:Yes;student:I guess,1
teacher:Ask your table,1
teacher:Equal to 12,1
teacher:Would that give us 12,1
teacher:Talk to your table,1
teacher:Do they match,1
teacher:Kai,1
teacher:So wed have 39;student:There would be a three where the one was and also a nine where the three was,1
teacher:Are we done,1
teacher:Pretty easy huh,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Are you sure;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:Before you start I want you to verify with your table that youre starting with the right step;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:Talk with your table about what youre going to do,1
teacher:Ready to talk about it;student:Six times three Oh do you put a 12,1
teacher:Josh,1
teacher:You want to add to make it improper up here;student:Because you first have to do 1 and 23 as an improper fraction,1
teacher:You think you can do it,1
teacher:Work with somebody at your table;student:No,1
teacher:As hard as were making it,1
teacher:Lots of steps;student:No,1
teacher:Could you know how to do all of the steps,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:ready,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Sounds good,1
teacher:Are we ready,1
teacher:Xavier,1
teacher:Did you hear what  said;student:When you divide it theyre separated into groups,1
teacher:She said,1
teacher:Were we doing some kind of grouping with fractions too,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Really,1
teacher:Oh now we want to go mix,1
teacher:Do we just have 18,1
teacher:Clara,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you think you figured this out,1
teacher:You have an answer but you dont feel confident,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you have an answer but you dont feel confident,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you do feel confident,1
teacher:Do our denominators match,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:Yes we should be right;student:the denominator,1
teacher:Is it equal to 12,1
teacher:Kai,1
teacher:Are we done;student:I know its a mixed symbol,1
teacher:Do I have enough to do two wholes,1
teacher:Did anybody get it,1
teacher:After seeing it like this was it really that hard,1
teacher:Ready to practice again;student:No,1
teacher:Right,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Judith;student:Add,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Does it;student:But does that still count,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:if we multiply by three are we going to get six;student:You need to add 13,1
teacher:Can you see Haley;student:Three,1
teacher:My numerator is now is this true for the second one;student:I do to the top,1
teacher:We are still at number one can I add that now,1
teacher:My denominator is the same right,1
teacher:Renada,1
teacher:Is that figure then a whole;student:76,1
teacher:Actually can Queen Ann split her land that way;student:Yes,1
teacher:Do you feel like you need to talk about it,1
teacher:Talk about it,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you think you have an idea how to do that Think I have an idea Ms,1
teacher:You took the yellow part and you just had one yellow part Jade;student:How I did it is basically I did 12  28  24 because the oldest should have like in this part and then the youngest one can have the green part,1
teacher:Did anybody else do this,1
teacher:Are they equivalent,1
teacher:You got confused on the queen part;student:Three,1
teacher:Im going to change all of the denominators to fit can I,1
teacher:Can we finish having a conversation about the first part;student:Are we supposed to be doing on the,1
teacher:Do we have a number that is in common,1
teacher:Yes Renada,1
teacher:Does my picture prove it;student:Yes,1
teacher:Could I divide my numerator and my denominator by four;student:Yes,1
teacher:Do you agree that five tenths is the same as one half,1
teacher:How are we feeling;student:Whole,1
teacher:You dont get the what,1
teacher:Thats what we did all right,1
teacher:Can she do it,1
teacher:Does she have to be part of that land;student:Does she have to be in that land,1
teacher:What do you think from the question,1
teacher:Whats a diagram;student:Whats a diagram again,1
teacher:Sonia,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you believe the Queen Anns initial plan will work,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you dont think it will work,1
teacher:It is half but did you hear what she was saying;student:But its a half,1
teacher:Ali say it again,1
teacher:Renada says it doesnt work because 12  1 3 13 does not equal a whole it equals more than one whole so my ask is can we prove it;student:It equals more than full and it equals,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you had a hard time coming up with the solution to this,1
teacher:What was hard about it,1
teacher:HH what was the struggle,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you have an answer,1
teacher:How do we feel;student:28,1
teacher:Good,1
teacher:Do you see the box which says The whole,1
teacher:Somebody read me the question,1
teacher:Jahari nice and loud,1
teacher:Ty can you read it,1
teacher:Judith can you read it,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:You think you can do it,1
teacher:Say that again,1
teacher:Hailey,1
teacher:Talk to your table;student:Because he did it,1
teacher:Sonia are you feeling confident,1
teacher:Am I ready to add now,1
teacher:Did you get it,1
teacher:Kaylee,1
teacher:Easy enough right,1
teacher:Did we only mess with the numerators;student:They do,1
teacher:Okay did you come up with this you were able to divide it up like this,1
teacher:Hold on one second to that did you have a hard time coming up with this;student:Yes,1
teacher:Was it easier having the fractions circles to look at;student:No,1
teacher:Because why say that again,1
teacher:Eight eighths which is the same as one half did we prove it,1
teacher:How do you feel;student:Yes,1
teacher:Questions;student:Good,1
teacher:Should I show you what the other,1
teacher:Do you think Queen Ann is going to be happy about your suggestion,1
teacher:Yes so Viviana do we only add the numerator;student:Add the top so you,1
teacher:Do you think these two things apply to subtracting fractions as well,1
teacher:Do you think we have to have the same denominator;student:Possibly,1
teacher:Do you think we only subtract the numerator and not the denominator;student:Possibly,1
teacher:Give me a complete sentence;student:Five,1
teacher:Do you think this rule of our denominators have to be the same,1
teacher:Its true for subtraction also,1
teacher:Do you think so;student:Yes,1
teacher:Let me ask you is this statement true four eighths plus five tenths equals one whole,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:Youve seen that,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Anybody,1
teacher:We have proof for this with addition because we can write this number model right,1
teacher:Following me,1
teacher:I want to make sure that youre seeing the connection between multiplying fractions and adding fractions okay,1
teacher:Do you see how multiplication is going to come in handy here,1
teacher:Could we write that in multiplication;student:Thats fine,1
teacher:So youre going to finish this page then you have math passages I believe on the very next page is that accurate,1
teacher:Clay do you have yours,1
teacher:Just talk about it,1
teacher:The boxes that I need done first Did you two discuss homework,1
teacher:What unit are we on,1
teacher:One three four and five is what I need you working on you got it,1
teacher:Why dont you read this to me,1
teacher:Okay go ahead,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:If I start out with four  box can I subtract 25 from that,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:So really when were looking at the addition all were doing is messing with our numerators right Ilik,1
teacher:Five okay;student:Five,1
teacher:Okay I put 18 teaspoon in each batch right;student:Because you put in cinnamon  18 of a teaspoon,1
teacher:Could I say 5 times 18;student:I got 18 times 5,1
teacher:My answer doesnt change right;student:58,1
teacher:We know this answer is true right,1
teacher:Talk with your table about it,1
teacher:Whats happening over here,1
teacher:Okay talk to your table about it,1
teacher:Could we use a cheat,1
teacher:Emmanuel;student:Well we knew that,1
teacher:Okay say it again;student:You have to make just take the 18 and try just add 5,1
teacher:Add the 5 to the 18;student:If you have 5 just make 5 times 18 add 5 to the 18 youll have 58,1
teacher:Does that help create something for people,1
teacher:Create what theyre thinking a little bit,1
teacher:Did you hear what she said;student:That since the denominator is going to be the same were technically just multiplying 1 times 5 so you will get 58,1
teacher:Any connection,1
teacher:Yes sir,1
teacher:Read it to me,1
teacher:Tell me what theyre saying,1
teacher:Remember these are all only corner maps okay,1
teacher:Do you see where you made your mistake,1
teacher:Is this connected the right way,1
teacher:Do you see how one missed coordinate changes your whole sailboat,1
teacher:You did yours;student:Mines different,1
teacher:Marco what question did you just ask,1
teacher:Asher,1
teacher:Remember when we attached those zeros,1
teacher:Talk to one another about how were doubling it,1
teacher:How are we doing,1
teacher:Its important that you only do sailboat one okay,1
teacher:Do not draw this one until you call me over okay,1
teacher:Yes Bruce,1
teacher:Read this next rule to me please,1
teacher:Yes but are you doing anything to this one;student:Then itll all be the same because if we double this thatll be that same number,1
teacher:Yes maam whats your question,1
teacher:Georgia do you have a question or are you done;student:Yes,1
teacher:Are you done with yours,1
teacher:Are these all plotted,1
teacher:Remember,1
teacher:Today I can represent mathematical problems on a coordinate grid and we have been working with coordinate grids havent we,1
teacher:Remember that,1
teacher:Kind of like our five or more,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:After applying rules the image you all know what an image is,1
teacher:Please turn and talk to your neighbor,1
teacher:Thats easy right,1
teacher:What does this say,1
teacher:You just know that when you draw it thats how you have to draw it okay,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:Kayla,1
teacher:I keep getting the same question and what is your question,1
teacher:What did you just say;student:How do you do it,1
teacher:What did Alexander say the rule was,1
teacher:What are you confused about;student:Im confused,1
teacher:Justin do you understand,1
teacher:Following me,1
teacher:put them in;student:No,1
teacher:Three plus two;student:Plus,1
teacher:Could we say that,1
teacher:3 times 5 is 15;student:Yes,1
teacher:Is that true;student:Five times Yes,1
teacher:We had some people use these other facts to help them figure out the first one right,1
teacher:Ready to make this tricky,1
teacher:Talk to your people;student:That one is a,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you think its 5;student:5 5,1
teacher:Okay raise your hand if you think its 50,1
teacher:ignore them and you end up with 5;student:Yes,1
teacher:She took  made a turnaround fact with multiplication and said Eli are you watching,1
teacher:Does that help,1
teacher:Did you talk yourself out of what you were thinking;student:150 divided by 30,1
teacher:Are we good;student:As long,1
teacher:with this;student:Yes,1
teacher:Why this 5 works,1
teacher:Makes sense,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:If we think about turnaround facts we could move these numbers around and still make equations that are correct right,1
teacher:Do you remember that,1
teacher:You with me,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Do we have an answer,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:You counted by 5;student:4,1
teacher:Iliana,1
teacher:Kai,1
teacher:You doublechecked your work by going back and trying the multiplication;student:4 x 5  20 so,1
teacher:5 x 5 you used that fact that that was too much so you had to take one group away;student:What I did was think of 5 x 5 which is 25 and then I just subtracted 5 and got 20,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:15 divided 3 equals 5;student:5,1
teacher:Okay so you were counting up by 3s;student:Because if I did that the opposite way it will still be skip counting and we also get 5  because we put everything  so,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:On a scale of one to five one being fairly easy division problem five being hardest division problem youve seen in your life where would you rate this,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:Emmanuel youre still not seeing it,1
teacher:Can we do repeated subtraction,1
teacher:Were going to take one group away right,1
teacher:read it,1
teacher:Kailey,1
teacher:Okay so youre giving me the answer;student:Three fourths,1
teacher:Think they do,1
teacher:Could would write another way,1
teacher:Is that true as well;student:Three times onefourth,1
teacher:We took three onefourths;student:Yes,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Is that true,1
teacher:Is this similar to what we did over here;student:Yes,1
teacher:Just like we can add whole numbers and as we say multiplication is repeated addition right;student:fraction,1
teacher:Following me,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:If three teaspoons equals one batch we want to know what two batches would make right,1
teacher:Both of them need three teaspoons right,1
teacher:Everybody on the same page here,1
teacher:We feel good;student:Yes,1
teacher:Thats better;student:Yes,1
teacher:Are both of those correct,1
teacher:Every other number has a zero lets just put a zero on that one right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:All right you want to try something else;student:Yes,1
teacher:harder;student:harder,1
teacher:You think its 50;student:Its 50,1
teacher:Okay so you got rid of these two because they could cancel each other out;student:If you take the two 0s from the 30 and the 50 If you take one 0 from the 50 and the 0 from the 30 and the two 0s from the  youll get 3 x 5  15 and then you add the two 0s back,1
teacher:Am I totally losing some of you,1
teacher:When were multiplying does it matter what order we;student:Six,1
teacher:Yes no,1
teacher:Now that we know that 24 divided by 8 is 3 can we use that to figure out 240 divided by 8,1
teacher:Okay thoughts questions;student:It would be 30 and I know its 30 because if you take away the 0 from the 24 and you just divide it 8 you add the 0 from the 24 to the 30 and it goes to,1
teacher:Questions;student:Yes,1
teacher:Joshua,1
teacher:Do you want to come draw;student:I drew vases,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Could we have done four plus four plus four,1
teacher:Are you ready to do some practice,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Are these tests;student:10,1
teacher:Fernando do you want to answer this,1
teacher:1025,1
teacher:Are the size of my slices the same;student:Yes,1
teacher:Questions on this one;student:Because if you had the fractio if you had a pizza and then you had over 25 pieces and then you ate 10 you had more than 525,1
teacher:Are you sure,1
teacher:Are my numerators the same,1
teacher:Are my denominators the same,1
teacher:If we make an equivalent fraction we make this really easy on ourselves right,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you made an equivalent fraction,1
teacher:I saw some good strategies dont get me wrong but are pictures always going to be reliable,1
teacher:Lets look at this should I change my first fraction or my second fraction,1
teacher:You want to change this one;student:Second,1
teacher:You would change the three;student:Ill change the three,1
teacher:We tackled this by giving a common denominator do you think we can get a common numerator,1
teacher:Now Im comparing 412 to 49 if this works 49 should still be bigger right,1
teacher:Multiply;student:Multiply,1
teacher:Are you sure;student:Yes,1
teacher:Where are you guys today;student:25,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you want to try the numerator;student:Top,1
teacher:Ready for another one,1
teacher:Emmanuel,1
teacher:Sonia,1
teacher:The whole thing;student:The whole piece,1
teacher:You wanted to use greater than and that was catching you up wasnt it,1
teacher:Could we read it backwards,1
teacher:All right you ready for something freaky,1
teacher:Harley,1
teacher:Xavier,1
teacher:I could multiply it,1
teacher:Sonia,1
teacher:You want to multiply;student:The first one,1
teacher:You want to turn the denominator to 25,1
teacher:You want to change the numerator,1
teacher:Let me ask you a question do you think it matters,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you want the denominator,1
teacher:You with me;student:Yes,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Whats that little rule I gave you;student:The smaller the pieces or smaller the fractions,1
teacher:You think 52100 is the largest,1
teacher:So it is 5200something yes,1
teacher:Xavier,1
teacher:You think the largest is 1112;student:The largest is 1112,1
teacher:Did you hear what Aila was saying;student:Because theres one more piece left but pieces are bigger,1
teacher:We figured out our largest could we figure out our smallest;student:Yes,1
teacher:You think 26;student:I think that after 110 its 26,1
teacher:Yes its equivalent to 13 right Emily;student:Its only a third of a pizza,1
teacher:Judith,1
teacher:52100 is really close to 12 right,1
teacher:Did you get it;student:I got it right too,1
teacher:You guys think youre ready to try some on your own;student:I got it,1
teacher:Xavier,1
teacher:Could I easily make those 10 denominators into 100 denominators,1
teacher:By multiplying by 10 right;student:Yes,1
teacher:Work with your table talk this out see if you guys can figure this out,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:Questions;student:720,1
teacher:Somebody I havent talked to Eli,1
teacher:Does that help,1
teacher:Youre quiet does that mean you have an answer,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:When we look at our list of fractions theres something in common right,1
teacher:Byron,1
teacher:Josh,1
teacher:HH,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:Emanuel,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:We have a numerator in common;student:The one,1
teacher:Talk with your table about it,1
teacher:Did you hear what she said;student:I started with 120 because all the denominators are the same number at the bottom and all the numerators numbers at the top is how many pieces you will get so I did 120 first was the smallest,1
teacher:Tenths;student:Because you have 20 pieces but youll only eat 19 and the others are the ones and 19 is the biggest,1
teacher:Eric,1
teacher:Israel,1
teacher:Was this pretty easy,1
teacher:Questions,1
teacher:Viviana,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you found a fraction circle that you think we could make an equivalent to one third,1
teacher:Michael which one do you want to try,1
teacher:You want two of them;student:Two,1
teacher:Does it work;student:Yes,1
teacher:Another one,1
teacher:What else,1
teacher:What do you think Sarah,1
teacher:Light green;student:Light green,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes you can,1
teacher:You think four;student:Four,1
teacher:Does this,1
teacher:Any others,1
teacher:Jeremiah what do you think,1
teacher:You want this purple,1
teacher:Does it work,1
teacher:Is there something in your fractions that we could match up to make one third,1
teacher:Does what work;student:Does one work,1
teacher:Weve looked at halves right,1
teacher:Im sorry what;student:What,1
teacher:Are you sure,1
teacher:Is that five tenths;student:Yes,1
teacher:Is that five tenths;student:No,1
teacher:Does that look life like it is equivalent to one half;student:Yes,1
teacher:No but those are the ones weve compared to one half right;student:We havent looked at all of them,1
teacher:Do you see a connection between these numbers,1
teacher:Hold on keep going,1
teacher:Im trying to understand keep going,1
teacher:Youre saying the numerator is half of the denominator;student:Its half of like four,1
teacher:Is three half of six;student:Theyre all equivalent,1
teacher:Is four half of eight;student:Yes,1
teacher:Is five half of 10;student:Yes,1
teacher:Isnt that crazy,1
teacher:Dont you love it,1
teacher:Its so easy,1
teacher:Do you want to try the green,1
teacher:One;student:One,1
teacher:Adam,1
teacher:Do we have a fraction circle with nine,1
teacher:Whatever I do the bottom,1
teacher:I do to the top;student:Whatever I do to the bottom,1
teacher:Whatever I do to the top;student:I do to the top,1
teacher:I do to the bottom;student:Whatever I do to the top,1
teacher:Easy enough right;student:I do to the bottom,1
teacher:Whats your question Ezra;student:I have a question,1
teacher:Were looking at this chart of equivalent fractions it gives you a fraction and it wants you to make the equivalent one wheres the Math journal,1
teacher:Do you see the chart,1
teacher:Can we make another fraction thats equivalent to nothing,1
teacher:Easy enough right,1
teacher:Can you switch it up;student:Can we switch it,1
teacher:All right,1
teacher:Everybody know what theyre doing,1
teacher:Chihara,1
teacher:Remember,1
teacher:This does not work with adding and subtraction okay are you ready,1
teacher:Heres my rule for making equivalent fractions are you listening;student:Yes,1
teacher:Is 10 half of 20 so is this equivalent to one half,1
teacher:Adam,1
teacher:Do we have nine there,1
teacher:Okay lets talk about why are you ready,1
teacher:Do you agree,1
teacher:Let me phrase it this way are you listening;student:I think it gives you four because its basically two sixths combined so of each one gives you double amount,1
teacher:Tessa you watching,1
teacher:Right this does not cut out evenly to share with three people does it;student:You will have one leftover which you can cut it,1
teacher:We said that one third is equivalent to two sixths yes,1
teacher:Ally,1
teacher:Ezra,1
teacher:We could add one or we could multiply it by two if we multiply by two are we going to get two,1
teacher:Do we see any connections from our numerator to our denominator,1
teacher:Could I go from one to four,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Do you see something,1
teacher:Lets go back to this one half one half we said was equivalent to fivetenths Im I right,1
teacher:Times five does it work;student:Five,1
teacher:Tessa,1
teacher:You want to add some six,1
teacher:Judith,1
teacher:Youre with me,1
teacher:26 you guys with me on that part;student:26,1
teacher:Aaron,1
teacher:Does that have anything to do with how many slices I ate,1
teacher:No thats just telling me the size of the slice that I ate really not telling me how many right;student:No,1
teacher:You want to try some more,1
teacher:You did yes but did I ever teach you any of that;student:Thought we did that to all denominators,1
teacher:EH,1
teacher:Do we have to do anything to our denominator;student:Seven,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you feel comfortable getting to this point if you were able to get the 76,1
teacher:Good raise your hand if take a step further and you went to the 16,1
teacher:Did I ask you to go that far,1
teacher:Im really hoping you got to this okay;student:No,1
teacher:Do we need to do anything to my denominators;student:Six,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you got this answer,1
teacher:All right youre ready for something a little more challenging;student:Should have picked me,1
teacher:Judith,1
teacher:Were going to add them right,1
teacher:Lets say Im eating pizza and lets go back to this idea of Im at Cicis Pizza pizza buffet you can go up you fill your plate right,1
teacher:Fractions You ready,1
teacher:Zach youre awake youre with us,1
teacher:Youre with me;student:Four,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:Sure,1
teacher:You heard that one,1
teacher:Eli;student:I think I got it,1
teacher:Jeremy,1
teacher:Josh,1
teacher:What;student:I thought of that,1
teacher:Can I ask you one more challenging question,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Like this;student:I think its 04,1
teacher:Is 410 equivalent to 40100,1
teacher:How do you feel;student:Zero,1
teacher:Here we go today are you ready,1
teacher:Lets think about weve done some work lets think about me eating pizza because I like pizza and I like eating so that makes sense right,1
teacher:I want one whole yard plus two thirds of another yard right,1
teacher:That accurately represent what I want,1
teacher:I need to add those together right,1
teacher:One half;student:Onetwo,1
teacher:You want to take one of these,1
teacher:Did we make a whole circle;student:Two,1
teacher:We have one half right,1
teacher:Following me,1
teacher:Could I write any number sentence using these fractions;student:Yes,1
teacher:I think we covered threefourths of a circle;student:Three fours,1
teacher:One half;student:Because the two fours and one equals to two,1
teacher:Did you hear what she said,1
teacher:Thats what you did to prove it,1
teacher:Do you think it equals one whole;student:Sure,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you believe that equals one whole;student:Yes,1
teacher:Did I cover if I were to look at this do they cover the whole thing,1
teacher:If we were talking pizza if half of the pizza and went back and got a fourth and then another fourth did I eventually eat the whole pizza;student:Yes,1
teacher:You want one with eight;student:Eighth,1
teacher:It wants us to make this right,1
teacher:They want us to make a whole right,1
teacher:Somebody read for me the fraction,1
teacher:Are we ready,1
teacher:Can I look at them both pieces,1
teacher:Can I add two thirds plus one third,1
teacher:Raise your hand when you get an answer;student:Yes,1
teacher:Great talk to your neighbor about your answer,1
teacher:Do I need to do anything to my denominators,1
teacher:How do I feel,1
teacher:Do we feel like we need more practice,1
teacher:Emmanuel youre okay,1
teacher:You want a hard,1
teacher:We want to have the denominators the same in order to add because if the denominators match we know all we have to do is add the numerators right,1
teacher:What I asked can I add to change a fraction,1
teacher:Could I change this fraction to have a denominator of 10,1
teacher:Can I,1
teacher:If I can change this to denominator 10 will I be able to add,1
teacher:Now can I add;student:Two,1
teacher:Questions about what youre going to do,1
teacher:You want a hard see what happens;student:No,1
teacher:Do I have any big pizzas,1
teacher:Is there a rule;student:Yes,1
teacher:Im sorry what;student:217,1
teacher:Do I still get the same amount,1
teacher:Say that again;student:How would you get the tenths for it to get 610,1
teacher:Questions,1
teacher:Feel like youre ready to practice,1
teacher:Okay easy enough right,1
teacher:100 right,1
teacher:Ariana,1
teacher:Questions about that one,1
teacher:Nine longs right;student:Nine longs,1
teacher:Well wouldnt that just be one two three four five six seven eight nine,1
teacher:Isnt that what wed get,1
teacher:This would be 09 right;student:Miss we do the same thing to the other up to five because its 09 00,1
teacher:Then down there does it ask you to turn it,1
teacher:No you just have to color right,1
teacher:Nine babies right,1
teacher:Do we have any babies,1
teacher:Like that right,1
teacher:Do we have any longs,1
teacher:Would we have any babies,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:When I look at this if I were to take that decimal and put it over here on my place by your chart Id go to the tenths place right,1
teacher:Grenada,1
teacher:Not a lot of pizza is it,1
teacher:Make it into 100 right,1
teacher:60,1
teacher:Are these equivalent;student:Six,1
teacher:Ready to try another one,1
teacher:Ready;student:Yes,1
teacher:Hard one,1
teacher:Does it really matter,1
teacher:Just that extra zero right;student:They are the same with just a zero,1
teacher:Are they equivalent,1
teacher:Yes because if we do this as a picture would we have any whole pieces,1
teacher:Would we have any longs,1
teacher:Here do we have any whole pieces,1
teacher:Questions comments concerns,1
teacher:Good,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Did I change this black part over here;student:Yes,1
teacher:Sonia,1
teacher:Is that going to work;student:I do to the top,1
teacher:Somebody else want to try one;student:No,1
teacher:Judith,1
teacher:Does that work,1
teacher:Are you remembering this;student:Yes,1
teacher:Yes Edith youre remembering;student:Yes,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Are you remembering,1
teacher:EH Higher,1
teacher:Is that what youre telling me,1
teacher:Are you ready;student:Do you get tired with each one,1
teacher:Renata,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:If we were to go over to our picture and we were to now make eight slices of pizza did I change how much I colored in,1
teacher:We agree;student:Yes,1
teacher:Who have I not talked Xavier,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Ringing a bell,1
teacher:Sounds familiar;student:Yes,1
teacher:Caleb,1
teacher:Jake,1
teacher:Okay for example we have a pizza maybe how many pieces do we eat;student:How many pieces we eat,1
teacher:How many pieces we get,1
teacher:Renata,1
teacher:Could we multiply by anything;student:217,1
teacher:Yes Bud;student:Yes,1
teacher:Now we remembered what a fraction is yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:Were looking at that equal part right;student:Its a fraction that has the same amount,1
teacher:You remember,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:You got one,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you have one;student:Yes,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you forgot how to make an equivalent fraction,1
teacher:Does that mean the same thing,1
teacher:That represents my 13 doesnt it,1
teacher:Yes sir;student:Okay,1
teacher:Once you are done I will give you the go ahead to chart it okay,1
teacher:Addisons the only one that actually was here the day we taught that,1
teacher:When you and your partner are done please stand,1
teacher:Do you have one in full parts,1
teacher:Its not helping one another is it,1
teacher:Now Im looking over and what are you doing,1
teacher:All right go ahead split,1
teacher:Remember that strategy;student:You add 16 to three and thats 19,1
teacher:Okay so if we look at the very first one we are going to two fifth plus one fourth okay,1
teacher:Theres two fifths right,1
teacher:And theres one fourth okay,1
teacher:Okay so if I take this okay,1
teacher:All right so what I did is I took my fifths right,1
teacher:I still need a whole other fourth to get to one right,1
teacher:Could we say its right,1
teacher:Is it going to be wrong,1
teacher:Did you use equivalent fractions,1
teacher:Are you able to solve these things,1
teacher:Did you list the multiples did you list the factors,1
teacher:Okay can I actually add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators;student:You need a common denominator to add and subtract fractions so it  like draw fractions and stuff,1
teacher:Start talking telling Mae;student:Joseph,1
teacher:Did you take a whole;student:We crossed out the eight put a seven right there and then we did 101 because  we took a whole,1
teacher:Did you do 23;student:We added a one  After that we  Then we did 23 which equals 1,1
teacher:Do you see what I was doing,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:No go ahead Annie;student:I dont know,1
teacher:A rule youve got to make sure that you follow those rules okay,1
teacher:I know its one and Im going to have one point something okay;student:Three,1
teacher:Only do one five three and seven A and D One five three seven A and D If seven A and D refer to a problem you didnt do just do use one that you did okay,1
teacher:No  you still have to do seven minus eight if you now have a number you can borrow from right,1
teacher:Now can I take one from nine,1
teacher:Can I take one from nine,1
teacher:Did you solve problems,1
teacher:Were you able to do them pretty successfully and easily;student:Yes,1
teacher:The exit slip okay,1
teacher:Can I get Joanne,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:And then one two three four okay,1
teacher:So its pretty close isnt it,1
teacher:What is that,1
teacher:Okay go ahead discuss,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Kayla were you able to solve problem one in your head,1
teacher:Could you please do that again,1
teacher:Am I correct,1
teacher:When you borrowed you suddenly made it 11 am I correct;student:Yes,1
teacher:113;student:I made it 113,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Dwayne,1
teacher:Because I have almost all plus almost a whole right;student:About two,1
teacher:You have to pay attention to the size of the fraction when youre estimating okay,1
teacher:No the one where you have to borrow okay,1
teacher:Does one line work better than putting both of them;student:I crossed out nine of them,1
teacher:Did you find your common denominator,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:Now is that easier to add,1
teacher:I now know my new denominator is 24 right,1
teacher:Did you say it because they all said it,1
teacher:We know that were really close to another right,1
teacher:What are you struggling with,1
teacher:Nothing,1
teacher:Why is nothing done,1
teacher:Heidi are you good,1
teacher:A 14 Im not even close to being at a half am I,1
teacher:Makes sense,1
teacher:Sage is the person doing the talking the scribe is the person writing correct,1
teacher:Do you remember our working with the number line,1
teacher:When I look at the fraction 25 I automatically know that it is less than a half dont I,1
teacher:Turn and talk to your neighbor,1
teacher:Is 35 more than a whole,1
teacher:Is this close to a half;student:A half,1
teacher:Is it,1
teacher:You have no idea why do you,1
teacher:Did you have any idea why you said that or did you say it because your friends all said it,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:Hey are you done;student:Im just going to go ahead and make a big one so I dont mix up my problems,1
teacher:Okay Alexander;student:I think you need a hundred because I already told  at first we nine but then you have eight hundredths but you dont need a whole other grid,1
teacher:Just nine;student:Nine,1
teacher:Would it just be the word;student:Ones,1
teacher:Hundredth so Clay do you understand where youre mistake was made;student:Hundredths,1
teacher:If you look is there one number to the right up the decimal,1
teacher:Clay,1
teacher:All right Clay make better sense now,1
teacher:I would like you to turn to talk with Franc and Roberto and Hudson,1
teacher:Ashley what was confusing,1
teacher:We have been working on those quite a bit am I correct,1
teacher:If you are using your resources you should be able to turn around and read that number in the value it is which then helps you say it right,1
teacher:Turn and talk to your neighbor,1
teacher:Whenever I am adding or subtracting the first thing I have to do is align my decimals okay,1
teacher:I could have put a bunch of different words in there couldnt I,1
teacher:You see what that means,1
teacher:Big difference right;student:Partial products is multiplication and partial sums is addition,1
teacher:Turn and work with a partner,1
teacher:Is that really that,1
teacher:When your team is done put your hands on your head,1
teacher:Franc,1
teacher:Addend remember she talked about that,1
teacher:Its different isnt it,1
teacher:I would like to take your grade on this okay,1
teacher:No we just want you to do two four and five okay,1
teacher:Did you really take 36 away,1
teacher:The thing you have to make sure of if you color You could see that answer is incorrect isnt it,1
teacher:I need you to take that and see if its easier to do it with the exes or taking the color okay,1
teacher:You done,1
teacher:See theres where your rules going to come into play isnt it;student:Okay,1
teacher:It didnt change your answer did it,1
teacher:No Im asking did it change your answer,1
teacher:You have your 74 there and then you colored 36 right;student:Im finished,1
teacher:Did you count these squares,1
teacher:You need to do your counting to make sure youre getting the right numbers okay,1
teacher:Did we solve decimal subtraction and addition problems,1
teacher:There was the difference between the two and the three my friends okay,1
teacher:Is that really that,1
teacher:Put you hands on your head when you are done,1
teacher:Put your hands up on your head when you are done,1
teacher:He should be able to explain it though am I right,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:When you and your partner are done go to a zero,1
teacher:Okay go please,1
teacher:Explain to me how that is  than the number because an estimate isn t actually do your problem is it;student:Six,1
teacher:You looked at it and you just rounded it to the whole number correct,1
teacher:Go ahead Lisa;student:I can do it,1
teacher:Is 5 tenths really smaller,1
teacher:Kayla,1
teacher:Finn go ahead,1
teacher:Would it be a good idea to use a grid to make this work,1
teacher:Do you think using a grid to solve this problem would be a good strategy,1
teacher:Are we in groups,1
teacher:Please discuss do you think using grids to solve this problem would be a good strategy,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Finn go ahead,1
teacher:I will know youre successful are we listening,1
teacher:Franc,1
teacher:Franc,1
teacher:You and your partner go,1
teacher:When someone is trying to think they need that wait time and as soon as your hand goes up what does that make your heart feel like,1
teacher:Clay,1
teacher:All right the first thing that theyre doing here is talking with you about using the partial sums addition but then theyre talking to you about estimating okay,1
teacher:If we look at these two numbers 456 correct,1
teacher:Four and six hundredths right,1
teacher:Im not multiplying am I,1
teacher:Is this easy to add;student:No,1
teacher:Havent even began to account for my 48 hundredths or my 291 thousandths have I,1
teacher:Did I do that right,1
teacher:Do you understand the importance of adapting the problem;student:Yes,1
teacher:Question;student:Yes,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:If I have 11 ten s do I have a whole;student:Six,1
teacher:Give him the number again,1
teacher:That wouldnt be 1000 because  1500  Does that make sense,1
teacher:Youre going to be able to explain it to me,1
teacher:Do you understand the importance of alignment,1
teacher:Do you see why were taking those away,1
teacher:Hey did you all do that;student:Okay so I did 3 13 and I knew that 2x3 is 6 so I did 1x2 which equals 2 and then I did  then I put these 3 right here and then I knew about 1 12  3x26,1
teacher:So is one whole is going to give me a bigger number at the top than at my bottom;student:Because 5x3 will be 15,1
teacher:Do I need to color in my half,1
teacher:Okay so now does my paper represent a 13 of a half,1
teacher:13 of that half right,1
teacher:Fair;student:Okay,1
teacher:If Im splitting this whole piece of paper into fourths wouldnt it look like that,1
teacher:Youve got to split the whole into fourths this time okay,1
teacher:lets count them,1
teacher:We have 12 because 4X3 is 12 right,1
teacher:So you would be doing then one two three four right,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:No just the ones you shade in twice okay,1
teacher:So did we apply and extend our understanding of finding fractions of whole numbers to finding fractions of fractions,1
teacher:Do I expect you all to be pros at it,1
teacher:When youve got one and two done I would like you to show me you are done by placing your threesome somewhere in the room or twosome in the room okay,1
teacher:You guys done;student:Okay and now five,1
teacher:Now what do I need to look at next;student:Fold,1
teacher:So you havent even done the first two problems,1
teacher:There you go so Im going to fold it in a half right;student:Its not a 12 of a 13 its,1
teacher:23 okay do you understand this;student:23,1
teacher:I would like you to do it together okay,1
teacher:Come on up,1
teacher:When the fraction you mean couldnt be divided by a half;student:My most challenging part was that the whole numbers couldnt be divided by a half,1
teacher:It should look like this am I right,1
teacher:Did you shade in half of it,1
teacher:Kayla did you color in what I asked you to color in,1
teacher:We all said that that would be correct because this is what we did right,1
teacher:Were going to fold it grid to size in half okay;student:Fold it in half,1
teacher:Turn and talk at your table,1
teacher:Dont do it just talk about it,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Do you know,1
teacher:Talk about it,1
teacher:Does everyone have a piece of paper that looks like mine,1
teacher:You should all have a piece of paper that look like mine now right,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Tera,1
teacher:In number one you divided;student:So what we did is me and Dean here divided the  by the numerator in the rule,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Youve got to be able to prove your thinking okay,1
teacher:Does it,1
teacher:Missy can I use you as my example;student:No,1
teacher:Makes more sense doesnt it,1
teacher:Is it easier just to draw a box divided into thirds and then break it into fifths,1
teacher:If you color in a third and you broke it into thirds this way isnt it going to be one of these,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:No if I have 13 shouldnt I have colored in right here;student:Six is colored in,1
teacher:If I have 25 shouldnt that have been colored in,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:When you drew your box so if your box The first thing I needed to do was break it into thirds right,1
teacher:Is that 13,1
teacher:Is that fifths,1
teacher:Now do you see it;student:Now I see it,1
teacher:If you are done give me a thumbs up;student:Okay,1
teacher:To interpret this you told me that I was looking at equivalent fractions right,1
teacher:Did your table group talk about anything Franc;student:Theyre telling you that like,1
teacher:Does that make sense now,1
teacher:Okay now go ahead,1
teacher:I could do this because as soon as I turn this into a fraction I have 15 fifths dont I;student:Three,1
teacher:Makes sense,1
teacher:The way you did it was easier wasnt it;student:Yes,1
teacher:Would the outnumber be the same for both tables,1
teacher:If I just gave you another number to do it by if I did 16 times 16 or divided by six would the numbers be the same,1
teacher:Turn and talk to your neighbor,1
teacher:I would have to have different in numbers wouldnt I,1
teacher:Dottie are you done,1
teacher:Would they still be the same if all as I did was changed it from 15 to 16 gave in numbers that went with my six divided by five instead of that dividing it by six and putting in numbers the same that would go with six;student:Yes,1
teacher:If I changed it to 16 all of my in numbers would have to be multiples of six right,1
teacher:Do you think these rules will produce the same outnumbers,1
teacher:Do you think these will produce the same outnumbers,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Youre going to have to discuss it and maybe,1
teacher:Franc come on up buddy,1
teacher:Do you think these rules that we have talked about will produce the same outnumbers,1
teacher:Turn and talk to your neighbor,1
teacher:Can I just subtract that;student:1 56,1
teacher:Raise your hand so I can see,1
teacher:Was it 12 of 3;student:Three,1
teacher:Anyone done with number four on the back  right here,1
teacher:Have you checked it,1
teacher:What honey,1
teacher:Did you get two and seventwelfths;student:Addition problem,1
teacher:Are we ready to listen,1
teacher:Did you both agree on your answers,1
teacher:Okay when you agreed on your answer did you doublecheck your work,1
teacher:Franc expand on exchange;student:exchange because we had to,1
teacher:That was why it was so difficult understanding that process okay,1
teacher:When you believe you have something to share put your finger on your nose,1
teacher:Fingers on the nose of people that have a noticing,1
teacher:Miss Clay,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:If I did multiplication which is what our learning objective is isnt it multiplication,1
teacher:Do I care if you do it by multiplying or dividing,1
teacher:Why not,1
teacher:Breanna Im coming to you,1
teacher:You guys copied that,1
teacher:Go Laura,1
teacher:Now can you do it,1
teacher:I made you talk through it because you need to help them okay,1
teacher:Ladies how are we doing,1
teacher:Bam bara bambam,1
teacher:Rather than meeting with a partner because were coming down on time Im going to come around and make sure that you got the ones I wanted you to get right right okay,1
teacher:Okay one times two is two correct;student:Two,1
teacher:Am I ready to solve it,1
teacher:Why not,1
teacher:Eight eightsix,1
teacher:Ms StrathomDo you see where I got that eight from WInnie,1
teacher:You understand,1
teacher:Do you understand where your mistake was made,1
teacher:Oh it is;student:Thats what I get,1
teacher:Can I take two from three,1
teacher:Jimmy the way I just coached you through that is how  rolling around on the floor telling him hes an awful teacher or an awful coach does not does it,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Kaylee I m coming to you;student:Nine,1
teacher:Do you see how I got my outs,1
teacher:Coming back to you Breanna,1
teacher:Thats what I was wanting you to explain because some of them didnt understand where 45 came from because your partner behind you didnt understand where the 45 came from am I correct;student:It come from when you just make it four on top of a one,1
teacher:Do you remember what it was,1
teacher:So you did 615 times two which was 1215 then you did two times,1
teacher:Do you know what Im asking you to do,1
teacher:Should it be 25 of 81,1
teacher:Because thats going to come out differently isnt it;student:Yes,1
teacher:Weve only got 3215 right,1
teacher:Then Im adding my 25 to my 15 which comes out to be to 25 okay,1
teacher:Georgia Im going to have you work at the table with your group okay,1
teacher:Does it say 12 of 3,1
teacher:Did you guys get your answer,1
teacher:Youre going to tell me what the answer is and then Im going to tell you if youre right or wrong okay,1
teacher:They are working on 112 of 334 Im correct,1
teacher:Can you do it with the fraction circles,1
teacher:Who and what table group had the first one,1
teacher:I am then going to let Joseph do the second one and Im going to have Missy coach because you coached that one correct,1
teacher:Theyre conferring Georgia Clayl and Kayla I need you guys to pay very close attention to this okay,1
teacher:Do you think youve got it Joseph,1
teacher:When youve got the answer to all three raise your hand,1
teacher:Royce Im coming to you;student:Three,1
teacher:Do you see how easy it was to get those ins and outs,1
teacher:That will take you to that next level okay,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:Ideally would I love you to be able to make sense of all of them,1
teacher:If you have one of the strategies thats great because with two strategies I can check my answers can I,1
teacher:Now that youve all got the answers one would hope that you know how to solve these because guys just looking at an answer does not help you does it,1
teacher:Who did 12 of 3;student:Yes,1
teacher:Very good okay so we had different strategies didnt we;student:You could do 2x7 but,1
teacher:Make 12 your over Yes 12 okay,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:So your answer is eight okay;student:Eight,1
teacher:As soon as we say I cant we wont right,1
teacher:Okay so does five times anything equal 12,1
teacher:Okay so we now know that if we have I have to work this out with you so if I automatically know I have 225 left and then I multiply that is it going to be 425;student:Two,1
teacher:Were going to go over this one and were going to help people okay,1
teacher:Try and I will allow you to phone a friend okay,1
teacher:Okay read this rule to me,1
teacher:Would you please have both partners have number three done so that we can come around and check it before independent work okay,1
teacher:My friends could I just do this taking away what two longs,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Right that makes sense;student:Zero,1
teacher:Is it really four though,1
teacher:If you both agree then Im going to have you have a seat on the carpet okay,1
teacher:Go discuss,1
teacher:Does it look the way you expected it to,1
teacher:Did you determine what one was right and what one was wrong,1
teacher:You need to do your work and Lisa needs to do her work because copying her does not teach you anything doesnt it,1
teacher:Lisa;student:Then if I put the letters in RC I see now,1
teacher:Helen how are we doing,1
teacher:Does the new trapezoid look the way you expect it,1
teacher:Okay but does it,1
teacher:Is it bigger,1
teacher:Remember,1
teacher:Does this make sense to you,1
teacher:Is the value of the expression greater than 45 x 9,1
teacher:What part does it make sense to you,1
teacher:Thats what its asking you to do okay,1
teacher:Everybody enlarge,1
teacher:Hudson,1
teacher:Russel;student:We made sense of it by,1
teacher:Did you have to look at the headings;student:Interpreting which,1
teacher:The coordinates okay;student:The coordinates,1
teacher:Would you agree with that,1
teacher:Yes you had to estimate what it would be okay;student:Yes,1
teacher:You need to remember to eliminate that word because thats not what its looking which would make it wrong wouldnt it;student:She got the same thing as me,1
teacher:Go back and figure that out with your group,1
teacher:You discuss it,1
teacher:Did you figure it out,1
teacher:Cooper are you doing all of these,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:550000,1
teacher:Does that make better sense,1
teacher:Remember when theres a TH after were looking on this side okay,1
teacher:We know that whatever it is that were doing today were starting with an original size and were enlarging it okay,1
teacher:Okay so its more of the writing part that doesnt make sense to you its explaining what the rule is;student:Some of the questions on how to interpret,1
teacher:You answered that so then what you would say on the back when it asks you Was your rule correct,1
teacher:Was your writing correct,1
teacher:All right table group leaders stand up please,1
teacher:I dont want a complete sentence do I,1
teacher:Hudson,1
teacher:Jake can,1
teacher:What is he doubling everybody,1
teacher:Do you see what your explanation needs to be like;student:Large,1
teacher:Sarah,1
teacher:Read the questions;student:Two and 10,1
teacher:Were my direction one person do it the other person copy,1
teacher:Im asking were my directions one person do it one person copy;student:No it was always just behind,1
teacher:I dont know you tell me,1
teacher:If Im looking for a folder art youve got folder art,1
teacher:What;student:Because you choose from one or the other one,1
teacher:Okay am I getting better;student:Wait so yes now we have to go to,1
teacher:Could I have made it bigger than that;student:Yes,1
teacher:Hudson is your table group done,1
teacher:Did you choose one that youre willing to share,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Flora excuse me what are you doing,1
teacher:Okay do we still have people working on this,1
teacher:Times every number times two;student:Times every times the number times two,1
teacher:The X coordinate times two and your response read that again;student:No the X coordinate,1
teacher:Were you specific in answering that question,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:You think theyre going to spread out more as well;student:I also think with the letters in the shape are going to get wider,1
teacher:Two times or twice the size right;student:Two,1
teacher:Did you have to make sense of the table,1
teacher:Do you see how specific they were,1
teacher:All right friends so with that being said does the new trapezoid look the way you expected;student:No it says predict,1
teacher:No youre doing the last one on was your thinking correct,1
teacher:I should hear talking amongst you and your partner,1
teacher:Did you make it twice as large,1
teacher:Okay so you need to make sure your explanation goes with the words that youre using okay,1
teacher:Are you all done talking,1
teacher:This is strictly just writing okay,1
teacher:Just because Im doubling the first one if I dont explain to my person that Im making it twice as wide on that X coordinate its not going to tell my reader what they need to know is it,1
teacher:Is that folder on,1
teacher:See how it makes sense that way,1
teacher:Does six times two equal 12,1
teacher:Does anyone remember,1
teacher:Friends youve got to use your math vocabulary because there are two holes in three right,1
teacher:You have to make sure that youre looking at your denominator to determine how many times does that denominator go into my numerator okay,1
teacher:Clay Im going to be coming to you to solve the next ones okay,1
teacher:Show me youre done by putting your finger on your nose,1
teacher:Im looking at three different ways that this was solved and I want them to explain their thinking okay,1
teacher:You dont understand at all okay;student:You dont understand,1
teacher:What were doing with our math now is we are interpreting the values so I can look at ordered pairs I can graph them and I can understand I can make sense of what theyre trying to tell me all right,1
teacher:They will understand it in context okay,1
teacher:Thats something were going to ask ourselves because we have to know whenever we do something that it is relevant to us okay,1
teacher:If somebody choreographs a dance I have to be able to interpret the choreography in order to perform the dance okay,1
teacher:You guys as well as myself we interpret things on a daily basis and we have to understand the context in which its being taught all right,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:First have across right,1
teacher:If I am extrapolating something I am writing that information on my graph to be able to connect it okay,1
teacher:Mariah would you please come up here with your whiteboard,1
teacher:My extrapolated shows the actual curve okay,1
teacher:go to Elm Haven at 930 youre most likely going to have to complete this over the weekend okay,1
teacher:Now our success criteria was I know Ive  After applying the rules did that image become modified;student:Yes,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Read the second;student:These ones,1
teacher:Are you guys ready for me to check,1
teacher:Okay Bruce read this rule to me,1
teacher:No what did she just say;student:X,1
teacher:All right are you ready ladies and gents,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Youve got to do the X coordinate first okay,1
teacher:Bam bara bam bam,1
teacher:Clay,1
teacher:Clay did you just hear me,1
teacher:Bam bara bam bam,1
teacher:How many of you thought this was a fun activity,1
teacher:Did we use a coordinate grid to plot points to form pictures,1
teacher:Did we actually apply rules;student:Yes,1
teacher:Clay this is a selfreflection not a Roberto reflection it says selfreflection okay,1
teacher:What are you doing right now that you shouldnt be doing,1
teacher:What should you be doing right now,1
teacher:Do Sarahs ordered pairs model the data,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Makes sense,1
teacher:One and two on page 139 with your table group okay,1
teacher:Any questions on what you should be doing,1
teacher:All right go ahead,1
teacher:We interpreted this data is that correct,1
teacher:You got it;student:I got it,1
teacher:You see how youve applied a rule,1
teacher:Really;student:Five,1
teacher:You and your partner will play this okay,1
teacher:Did you fill it in,1
teacher:Is that really only going up by ones,1
teacher:Two three six five does that make sense,1
teacher:Is this first number two,1
teacher:Tell me;student:I know,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Please turn and talk to your neighbors at your table,1
teacher:Im going to give everyone 30 seconds to look at that data table see if you can come up with how old she was and be able to explain it to your table group okay,1
teacher:Its not on there is it,1
teacher:Do her ordered pairs model whats there,1
teacher:The three and seven is switched;student:The three and seven is switched,1
teacher:Okay what about the Is that the only one that is switched,1
teacher:Is that going to mess up my data when I start graphing that,1
teacher:Im not talking about the same thing if I reverse it am I,1
teacher:Im talking about Liliths age here and Noahs age here right;student:No,1
teacher:I am going to watch you write their ages as ordered pairs because this didnt say anything about X and Y coordinates did it,1
teacher:12,1
teacher:Do our data tables always say X and Y coordinates;student:No,1
teacher:Does that go back to what our learning objective was,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:You dont want her data because hers wasnt right remember,1
teacher:Did you not tell me that her data wasnt correct,1
teacher:Do you remember why her data wasnt correct,1
teacher:Is it a straight line going up though;student:I noticed that its in a straight line going up,1
teacher:Its going diagonally but its going up;student:Its going diagonal,1
teacher:This is a data table right,1
teacher:Does that work,1
teacher:Bam bara bam bam,1
teacher:Is that any better,1
teacher:Wave to me right now if you are the writer for number three,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:You know the way a coach would coach in a soccer game,1
teacher:How much time do you need to finish,1
teacher:Clay,1
teacher:Questions comments feedback and would you tell me your name please;student:Because its closer to estimates,1
teacher:Bruce;student:Bruce,1
teacher:Hey would you please call on someone from our class;student:Yes,1
teacher:Will you call in someone else,1
teacher:Is this an okay estimate,1
teacher:Does it work;student:Yes,1
teacher:Would you please tell your partner thank you,1
teacher:Lets read what it says in black under learning intention,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Would you wave to me right now if you are coaching for number three,1
teacher:Say atoms,1
teacher:Are you talking about letter D;student:Actually we didnt,1
teacher:Mariah come on down,1
teacher:Were we able to look at the coordinates and determine the rule,1
teacher:You made revisions and I am going to look to see what good responses you have okay,1
teacher:Sound good,1
teacher:If I need all of your attention my signal is always this okay,1
teacher:It means eyes on  Ms Strathom like you really turn your body and look toward me okay ready,1
teacher:Talk to your friends,1
teacher:Okay so would you stand up for me right now if you are Clay if you could sit there just for this activity okay;student:Yes,1
teacher:Will you stand up please if youre a one or a three,1
teacher:You are doing problem number,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Okay wave at me if youre writing,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Youre only doing problem number what,1
teacher:If you are done with number two you can do a different math box on a page while you wait okay,1
teacher:Would you call on someone please,1
teacher:Read the second bullet with me,1
teacher:Ready go,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:We are going to do because we just did an addition decimal problem together were going to do one subtraction together before you do some on your own okay,1
teacher:If you are a number one stand up,1
teacher:Stand up if youre a one or a three,1
teacher:You are the coach okay,1
teacher:Twos and fours you are the writer for number one okay,1
teacher:If youre a one and a three put your pencil in your desk so youre not tempted to write okay,1
teacher:Youre going to get a colored pencil from your box as another one of your colors okay,1
teacher:Colored pencil okay,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Kayla your partners counting on you honey okay,1
teacher:Coach what coaches do is they also praise so would you please take a minute to praise your partner,1
teacher:If youre not quite done finish it and then youre going to switch roles and do number,1
teacher:Well stop and talk about that when youre done with subtraction okay,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:James be my coach,1
teacher:Okay no Clay,1
teacher:Does that make sense;student:Youve got  there and then the tenth it goes up here,1
teacher:Kayla keep calling on kids,1
teacher:All right whos next,1
teacher:This is going to be one of those things Ms Strathom might do it a little different but Mrs  Ms Strathom Im going to say three two one then wherever Im standing show me your whiteboard okay,1
teacher:Im going to need you to stop shouting out okay;student:Im not done,1
teacher:Ready and go,1
teacher:Could you start by writing out decimal places,1
teacher:Because we have nothing in the tenths place and the zero holds the place right;student:First  and after the decimal and onethird of that will be two and thats in the hundredths place so itll be 200 and then the decimal and then the sixhundredths so therell be a zero before the six,1
teacher:We have a grid in front of us and lets see Kaylie we will read,1
teacher:Do you mind reading what it says on the board for us in a nice loud voice,1
teacher:What rule did they use;student:The rule,1
teacher:Wave right now if you need a partner,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Will you please show me on your fingers if you need zero minutes one minute or two minutes to show each of those four answers,1
teacher:Check your thinking is it reasonable does it look right,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:This is just a thinking time okay,1
teacher:Okay Missy put your board down first please,1
teacher:Thank you my dear go,1
teacher:Can you tell me your name honey,1
teacher:Is that good folder art,1
teacher:All right were you able to understand others thinking,1
teacher:Okay Bruce;student:No,1
teacher:Do we still have two,1
teacher:Is there a difference of six and four,1
teacher:Is that two,1
teacher:Six and eight is that two,1
teacher:Did they enlarge it,1
teacher:No its the exact same isnt it;student:No,1
teacher:Could I have changed the coordinates to enlarge the book,1
teacher:Okay so is it easier to create a rule when enlarging something using the original coordinates and just doubling them or tripling them or quadrupling them;student:It says right there you just redraw it then try and redraw it as you can,1
teacher:No youre going to get to think about it,1
teacher:This is student Bs work right;student:Thats student Bs work,1
teacher:Are we talking about the same thing,1
teacher:Discuss in your groups go on,1
teacher:Im going to ask you did you all do anything wrong yesterday,1
teacher:Did you enlarge it;student:Yes,1
teacher:Did you meet the objective;student:Yes,1
teacher:It would be in the what;student:Because they didnt use the same coordinates otherwise if they did itd be in the,1
teacher:Am I going to be able to paint the same sized mural here that I can on that back wall,1
teacher:Okay the next person should be talking or just go around in circles,1
teacher:The shortest hair to go first,1
teacher:Does the rule always have to be double;student:Double it,1
teacher:Do you have one line drawn that I could look at;student:Four,1
teacher:Is that a little bit bigger,1
teacher:Could they have gone bigger;student:Yes,1
teacher:When Jake said he was designing a folder the first thing you should have done was pulled the folder out right,1
teacher:Phone a friend,1
teacher:So think back to yesterday we all created a diagram that we enlarged correct,1
teacher:Georgia,1
teacher:Did that necessarily mean that your enlargement was incorrect,1
teacher:Kind of like if Im going to buy pizza for the class Im not going to buy one pizza am I,1
teacher:You didnt get it drawn,1
teacher:Who got theirs drawn,1
teacher:Now Im going to show you an enlarged because they did enlarge it they made it two times bigger because they made both the X coordinate and the Y coordinate bigger right,1
teacher:Okay turn it talk to your neighbors take turns talking,1
teacher:I would like the person with the shortest hair to go first,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Do I have windows on this side;student:No,1
teacher:Do I have as many cabinets on this side;student:No,1
teacher:Youre going to revise and reevaluate okay,1
teacher:Did you hear that Matty,1
teacher:Nice job you revised your writing,1
teacher:How are we doing,1
teacher:How can we help you redo it,1
teacher:Did you revise everything that you needed to,1
teacher:Okay so what is question one and two,1
teacher:Okay so did you do that;student:Why its wide as it is high,1
teacher:Describe what you think and were those correct with what you did the first time,1
teacher:Really,1
teacher:Is that really 35,1
teacher:Im asking the question did you look at the size here,1
teacher:Wall to wall bed so youve got to think about the size that you are making this on the space that you have okay,1
teacher:Did we discuss other students work,1
teacher:School;student:School,1
teacher:Is that the only time we do it,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Matty can we stop this,1
teacher:What do you need help coordinating,1
teacher:Yes if I made another column another box that would work better for your writing wouldnt it,1
teacher:I want you to try different rules but the first thing you need to make sure is that your coordinates are large enough to meet the grid because could I do Im going to make it 10 times bigger,1
teacher:Okay yes maam,1
teacher:Like Stella youre saying we didnt get ours done is what youre telling me right,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:No how do we write our new rules;student:Would we write our new rule on this paper,1
teacher:Youve got the back of the paper okay,1
teacher:Jacob what are you doing,1
teacher:Jenn;student:Writing,1
teacher:Work with your table group,1
teacher:Kayla and Shyanne make sure youre using the proper vocabulary okay,1
teacher:Cooper would you work on some math until I move on to read aloud please,1
teacher:Take your maths books out and work on some maths for a few minutes okay,1
teacher:Are you doubling;student:2x6,1
teacher:because that means the same as double right,1
teacher:Are you multiplying X and Y by six,1
teacher:Thats going to be very difficult to read isnt it,1
teacher:You two are partners right,1
teacher:Understand;student:Tractor tractor tractor tractor,1
teacher:Did you understand why,1
teacher:Again similar to how you write domain you would say that is all x s that are  0 or all the x s that are between three and five that would be 3  x  5 like that right,1
teacher:Greg,1
teacher:That ones that ones got a little bit more stuff in it right,1
teacher:So the reason why well I guess we should probably simplify that one right,1
teacher:Does that work for everyone,1
teacher:That sound good,1
teacher:Okay there any questions so far with these steps,1
teacher:by the people in here people online Are there any questions,1
teacher:Okay that sound good so far,1
teacher:Questions on this substitution example before we do one more elimination example,1
teacher:Okay so thats the these two right Mia;student:3x is to y plus 3y minus x equals 180,1
teacher:So three y minus x plus y minus x does is that what you said Rob,1
teacher:So you can set up a system right,1
teacher:Okay now the good news is the way this problem is set up is that 2x and negative 2x are going to cancel out when we add these togetherOkay,1
teacher:I guess Im thinking of like which of these because we simplify them Right,1
teacher:Yeah I would probably pick the red because its all positive right,1
teacher:You have a question,1
teacher:Any questions so far on anything we did for this one,1
teacher:Anna whats up,1
teacher:Yeah we need to check right;student:inaudible,1
teacher:Okay Evan,1
teacher:That sound good,1
teacher:Okay x is 133 does that sound good Everyone,1
teacher:online Anybody have any questions,1
teacher:Say it again,1
teacher:2x equals 76;student:2x equals 76,1
teacher:Y plus 76 equals 180;student:You could also do Y plus 76 equals inauidble,1
teacher:Do we do we need to solve these using a system of equations,1
teacher:That sound good everyone,1
teacher:So were gonna have a lot of steps to show okay,1
teacher:Gavin,1
teacher:Go ahead Gavin,1
teacher:Everybody Okay with those steps so far,1
teacher:The second one;student:The second one,1
teacher:Okay are we done,1
teacher:All right that sounds good everyone,1
teacher:Thats good everybody,1
teacher:Anybody online have any questions,1
teacher:Ok that sound good for number one,1
teacher:Lizzie whats up,1
teacher:Does that make sense Lizzie,1
teacher:Alright sound good so far everyone,1
teacher:Congruent,1
teacher:That sound good so far,1
teacher:anybody online have any questions so far in this one,1
teacher:And that sounds good so far,1
teacher:Everybody online doing okay on this one,1
teacher:Were gonna check it okay,1
teacher:I just have a question,1
teacher:Yeah go ahead;student:Like another way you could solve this problem,1
teacher:Um so Lizzie can you repeat what you just said,1
teacher:So like do you see how this ones kind of like this This line right here is not parallel to this line,1
teacher:You see that Lizzie,1
teacher:Does that make sense;student:Oh yes,1
teacher:That sounds good So far,1
teacher:corresponding so Okay and the way I remember corresponding same location right,1
teacher:Anybody online have any questions so far,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:Any questions Anybody,1
teacher:Any questions Anybody online,1
teacher:alright number two someone on line,1
teacher:are they the same;student:Um,1
teacher:So labeling them is really just checking to make sure we got it right right,1
teacher:Sound good everybody,1
teacher:And are same side interior anglesThe same,1
teacher:So 47 plus y is going to equal 90 do you agree with that Christian,1
teacher:So just be aware of thatOkay,1
teacher:Okay so when were checking it what do we need to make sure we need to make sure this angle plus this angle equals 180 Right,1
teacher:Anybody online have any questions about these,1
teacher:Okay anybody in here have any questions,1
teacher:And then thatll be probably perfect time for us to be starting the quiz right,1
teacher:Okay so once I covered up that half does this just look like two parallel lines with the transversal,1
teacher:interior angles,1
teacher:supplementary,1
teacher:Any questions on those steps,1
teacher:Okay any other questions on number three,1
teacher:Any questions on number one,1
teacher:Y vertical angles right;student:Y,1
teacher:Anybody have any questions on what a midpoint is right now,1
teacher:All right any questions on these definitions,1
teacher:Any questions on the graphic organizer,1
teacher:Any questions on those definitions,1
teacher:Are there any questions about example one before we start example two,1
teacher:Are there any questions so far about how I came up with this picture from this first sentence,1
teacher:Does that help Patrick,1
teacher:We want to set it equal to zero Right,1
teacher:So could we also take away 8x at the same time;student:Right,1
teacher:We could do 12 and one do you think that ones going to work;student:Can you do 12 and one,1
teacher:Ethan,1
teacher:Okay everybody good So far,1
teacher:Are there any questions on these steps,1
teacher:Okay are there any questions on that step that we just talked about,1
teacher:Any questions on example two,1
teacher:Are there any questions on what your homework looks like For tonight,1
teacher:And also know you can always rewatch this as well after after class okay,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions on how I found the slope on this one,1
teacher:Any questions on this one,1
teacher:can either type it or you can unmute if youd like,1
teacher:Okay any questions about how I found my slope using the slope formula,1
teacher:Anybody have any questions on this one,1
teacher:questions on this one,1
teacher:Okay Are there any questions on this graph,1
teacher:Okay any questions on the graph at all,1
teacher:Any questions so far before we write the equation,1
teacher:Any questions on this one Anybody,1
teacher:So does that answer your question,1
teacher:That makes sense Rylee,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions on this problem for today,1
teacher:How do we use how we use the slope formula or what the steps are,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions about that,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:Any other questions right now on this one,1
teacher:Okay any questions on this one,1
teacher:And can we combine those two make three,1
teacher:no;student:No,1
teacher:Okay are there any questions on the steps so far in this problem,1
teacher:any questions so far Im right angles or acute angles,1
teacher:or right angles perfect corner,1
teacher:Okay any questions on any of these four Before I talk about one other one,1
teacher:So thats more than a straight line,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:Any other questions so far on page 21,1
teacher:Any questions so far on that,1
teacher:Okay does anybody have any questions about anything that weve written out so far before we talk about the angle addition postulate,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:Okay any questions on these hints before I talk about what your homework is for tonight,1
teacher:Okay thats not good everybody,1
teacher:Does this kind of look like a system of equations here,1
teacher:Little bit,1
teacher:Okay with me,1
teacher:Okay any questions so far in this,1
teacher:Lily Are you there,1
teacher:All right so lets start with Nick Nick,1
teacher:The answer your question Lila,1
teacher:All right any question on this little segment of notes so far,1
teacher:Anybody have any questions so far,1
teacher:Okay any questions so far About how I checked my work there,1
teacher:Yeah go ahead;student:Um I have a question,1
teacher:Taylor,1
teacher:Whats up,1
teacher:Tristan,1
teacher:Are there any other questions on these three examples,1
teacher:Chris,1
teacher:So three collinear points any three points that make a straight line okay,1
teacher:Okay so say those points again;student:Uh K,1
teacher:Say it agian for m Amara;student:would that be it,1
teacher:Did you say be;student:inauidble HE,1
teacher:Any questions on any of the things that we talked about in this warm up here,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:And Lila Lila you have a question,1
teacher:And when we talk about the graphic organizer kind of at the end of this lesson then remember you know were going to remember what we said about vertex right,1
teacher:Okay what if I told you a was not a point on here;student:I said Ahce,1
teacher:Okay any questions on this one,1
teacher:So like one is the same as 78 because theyre both vertical right,1
teacher:That sound good,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:Do they look equal,1
teacher:squares usually has like the most things right,1
teacher:So are the diagonals congruent On the square,1
teacher:Okay are the diagonals crossing perpendicularly,1
teacher:Are they perpendicular to each other,1
teacher:45 right,1
teacher:Okay anybody have any questions before we go on to page six,1
teacher:parallelogram;student:parallelogram,1
teacher:All we know is it has two sets of equal sides right,1
teacher:Theyre the same right,1
teacher:So eg is the same as f h Okay,1
teacher:alright all right someone online,1
teacher:Someone want to be brave on this one,1
teacher:Everybody agree,1
teacher:Are opposite angles congruent,1
teacher:180 minus 148 does 32 sound right,1
teacher:In this picture are all the angles the same,1
teacher:Yeah Im going to draw a better example because that one especially on the screen doesnt look super convincing right,1
teacher:Cant we combine,1
teacher:So those work,1
teacher:Does that sound good to everybody,1
teacher:Because I think this is the only one that we know two angles in right,1
teacher:Is anybody have any questions on those steps for right now,1
teacher:Anybody in here have any questions on those,1
teacher:So last week we talked all about parallelograms Right,1
teacher:Everybody agree,1
teacher:rectangle,1
teacher:Everybody agree,1
teacher:Does everybody agree that opposite sides are congruent,1
teacher:Everybody good with the side so far,1
teacher:Is that true for here,1
teacher:Are the opposite angles congruent,1
teacher:is this angle congruent to that angle,1
teacher:How about this one are opposite angles congruent,1
teacher:Okay so pretty useful to know the diagonals bisect,1
teacher:Okay any questions on number two before we go to number three,1
teacher:And this one 80 because those make 180 right,1
teacher:Everybody agree so far,1
teacher:These sides are congruent this would be point D Everybody agree so far,1
teacher:Everybody agree so far,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:Anybody online,1
teacher:Someone in here,1
teacher:Notice how this points in line with this one,1
teacher:Any questions on number one or number two for our warmups for today,1
teacher:Any questions in here,1
teacher:Any questions anybody online,1
teacher:Any questions on this one so far,1
teacher:Any questions anybody online,1
teacher:Anybody have any questions on three or four,1
teacher:Any questions on three or four,1
teacher:All right how are we doing in here everyone,1
teacher:Anybody online have any questions so far,1
teacher:That sound good everybody,1
teacher:Quadrants of a graph,1
teacher:Does everybody remember quadrants,1
teacher:Theyre the same,1
teacher:Is this an isosceles,1
teacher:triangle,1
teacher:Was that alt,1
teacher:Wait say that again,1
teacher:Because its complimentary right,1
teacher:What was that,1
teacher:Say it again Brad,1
teacher:Wait did I draw that wrong;student:Theyre opposite inauidble,1
teacher:Does Thatgood everybody,1
teacher:That sound good everybody,1
teacher:Anybody online have any questions About that so far,1
teacher:Your Xvalue tells you the sidetoside movement okay,1
teacher:Anybody remember,1
teacher:Okay any questions so far,1
teacher:The yvalue is always zero right;student:I mean the Yvalue,1
teacher:Yeah that makes more sense right;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:Everybody agrees so far,1
teacher:Say that again Christopher;student:Mr G I have a problem loading the whiteboard,1
teacher:Everybody agrees so far,1
teacher:F Okay;student:F,1
teacher:K does that make sense,1
teacher:You have a question Sean,1
teacher:So what did you say,1
teacher:Okay any questions so far,1
teacher:So if you have a triangle with three sides okay and maybe lets change it To make this a little bit more lopsided okay,1
teacher:if you change the three sides okay,1
teacher:That soun good everyone,1
teacher:Here what do we want to call the first one triangle what,1
teacher:D Okay so B matches up with D Okay;student:D,1
teacher:Okay does That sounds good So far,1
teacher:Ian;student:You get the same triangle,1
teacher:If you connect my elbows as the third side versus this right,1
teacher:Any other questions so far,1
teacher:Is that Heiko,1
teacher:So this side right here ad five inch side does that have a side that it matches up with on the other one,1
teacher:Does everynody see that,1
teacher:Everybody agree,1
teacher:three dots three sides and were just gonna label this triangle ABC give everybody 10 to 20 seconds to draw that triangle in okay,1
teacher:The word included in geometry is similar to the word included included like if you include someone into a group okay,1
teacher:so yes yeah,1
teacher:That makes sense Ian,1
teacher:In between these two purple segments angle B okay,1
teacher:Does that sound good so far everybody,1
teacher:So in geometry included means between right,1
teacher:equal;student:equal,1
teacher:Okay thats good so far,1
teacher:And if youre talking about a triangle you got to put that symbol in front right,1
teacher:Alright so Im going to set up a little bit more out here right,1
teacher:A so wherever the I is on this one we need to write A over here and then these are the same these matches theyre in the same spotOkay,1
teacher:Yes go ahead Alexander;student:can I restate that,1
teacher:Okay Does that sound good so far,1
teacher:Anybody online have any questions so far,1
teacher:If I put these together into a triangle theres only one way That this triangle can look okay,1
teacher:Up here EF right;student:Yes,1
teacher:Everybody agree,1
teacher:Maybe the six the six each one that matches up with this one right,1
teacher:Is this side the same for both of them,1
teacher:Anybody in here have a suggestion,1
teacher:What What should we start with our first one,1
teacher:But what like just all three,1
teacher:And that makes sense on that one,1
teacher:Okay everybody online doing okay so far,1
teacher:Yes Ian,1
teacher:See that one,1
teacher:Is someone seeing what Im not seeing here,1
teacher:Thats the same triangle right,1
teacher:Are there any other questions on this,1
teacher:Everybody agree,1
teacher:One more side okay,1
teacher:And so it would be really nice if we knew that this side was congruent to this side right,1
teacher:But thats the missing information to know that side angle side for this one guys so good,1
teacher:like normally if youre parallel lines we have like this symbol right,1
teacher:Just in this picture does it tell us the lines are parallel,1
teacher:For this problem Im going to say no because I want to show one specific thing but in a quadrilateral is a parallelogram right,1
teacher:Ian,1
teacher:third side 123123 Are these the same triangles,1
teacher:Just like in a different position;student:Yes,1
teacher:Which one;student:E,1
teacher:Everybody okay so far,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:Anybody online have any questions,1
teacher:So everybody agree we have two sets of equal sides,1
teacher:Check out what happens five w divided by five is W five divided by five is one w plus one equals five D divided by five is V Is that way easier to deal with,1
teacher:And do we have side side side,1
teacher:from this picture,1
teacher:Do we have a side angle and a side congruent,1
teacher:Ian,1
teacher:Okay so now Do we have side angle side for both,1
teacher:What was that Sean,1
teacher:I itself;student:I,1
teacher:That sound good to everybody,1
teacher:Do we have three sides congruent,1
teacher:We good on five and six,1
teacher:Maybe someone can unmute and tell us or type it in,1
teacher:Okay any questions So far,1
teacher:Yes Delta,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Its one more fourth right,1
teacher:So crew are these going to taste the same,1
teacher:Tyson,1
teacher:Is one and onethird bigger,1
teacher:Or is one and onefourth bigger,1
teacher:Are you ready to see this,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Are you guys ready,1
teacher:Denver,1
teacher:Giselle,1
teacher:Okay sound good everybody,1
teacher:for that one,1
teacher:So you want to get to one orange  juice,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:Or do you want to do how much orange juice per soda water,1
teacher:Do you want to find the unit rate,1
teacher:go;student:Someone else,1
teacher:Partner B it is your turn,1
teacher:Delta,1
teacher:Did they pay the same rate,1
teacher:Esther,1
teacher:So we can compare right,1
teacher:So we have the exact same thing in our ratio tables right,1
teacher:Yeah Delta,1
teacher:Would you like to check;student:If you divided Andres ratio table divide by three we could get the same thing as the first column for Diego,1
teacher:So lets divide by  three and then so we can just see if three tickets would cost the same right,1
teacher:Should we put an exclamation mark,1
teacher:So if you think Lynn stand up please,1
teacher:If you think Zyon stand up please,1
teacher:Stand up please,1
teacher:Joyce lets hear it,1
teacher:So do you want to do how much soda water per orange juice,1
teacher:Any questions on this one,1
teacher:Okay any questions on these points,1
teacher:All right is this a linear function,1
teacher:Now this last question actually really meant to say is it linear,1
teacher:So if the question is is it a linear function,1
teacher:That makes sense,1
teacher:All right any questions on this problem or functions before we move on to the next part,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions,1
teacher:Before we end for today,1
teacher:Vera do you have a question,1
teacher:Vera Do you have a question,1
teacher:Yeah go ahead;student:I have a question,1
teacher:Margo,1
teacher:All right any questions on that one,1
teacher:Alright any questions on that one,1
teacher:Okay so just all I want to do Paulinay already did it draw a straight line with a positive slope a straight line that has a negative slope I want to compare and see what we kind of think and then and kind of get the conversation going about slope okay,1
teacher:Any questions on positive slope and negative slope,1
teacher:So can you sketch a line that has a slope of zero,1
teacher:Okay so Im going to write Is this a function,1
teacher:Questions on this one so far,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:All right any questions so far,1
teacher:Any questions on this one so far,1
teacher:Any question so far on this problem,1
teacher:questions so far,1
teacher:This is a one step equationYeah,1
teacher:Anybody have questions on this one so far,1
teacher:Are there any questions so far,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:Partner A on your marks get set,1
teacher:I want you to tell me is this a function,1
teacher:Is this a linear function,1
teacher:Any questions on this one so far,1
teacher:Is it a function,1
teacher:Is it a linear function,1
teacher:And if youre stuck on if its a function or not take a look at the x values or draw in a vertical line or imagine drawing in a vertical line and seeing you can even like hold your hand up to graph and see does it cross at any Does it cross that more than one point,1
teacher:So is this a function,1
teacher:And so is this a function,1
teacher:Is this a linear function,1
teacher:Anybody have any questions about those,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:All right Giselle,1
teacher:Hey crew,1
teacher:Nylah lets start with you,1
teacher:Do you feel like I wrote that down for what you said,1
teacher:And then you saw three times three again;student:Yeah,1
teacher:And then you multiplied the whole thing by two cause you knew there were two groups of that right,1
teacher:Jude,1
teacher:Would you guys like to do another one,1
teacher:You guys ready,1
teacher:You guys ready,1
teacher:Gavin do you want to share,1
teacher:Go for it,1
teacher:You got 48,1
teacher:Did I hear from Jason last time,1
teacher:Go for it Jason,1
teacher:So you did six times two,1
teacher:Whos going first,1
teacher:And then maybe divided that by two,1
teacher:You guys ready,1
teacher:You guys ready,1
teacher:Okay Ava,1
teacher:Im like you know what,1
teacher:I decide for Eloise and I that Im just going to make a very small batch and Im just going to have one fifth of the amount of casserole that I need okay,1
teacher:Okay and I hope that you guys every time are going back to the first column okay,1
teacher:Yeah Brynn,1
teacher:Do you remember,1
teacher:Is it three;student:Three,1
teacher:This is the one working for this one,1
teacher:This one were just comparing Oh did I goof it up;student:Wait we just left out the tuna,1
teacher:We could do that but wed have to divide them both by the same number right,1
teacher:Can I see some raised hands,1
teacher:Does anyone want to share their thoughts;student:Okay,1
teacher:Corey,1
teacher:You guys say it,1
teacher:You guys say it;student:Subitizing,1
teacher:You guys ready,1
teacher:And then you saw those two groups three times,1
teacher:So he did six times two because there were six You said there were six in each row or in each column,1
teacher:Campbell did we hear from you last time,1
teacher:Yeah Giselle,1
teacher:Do you know what that means,1
teacher:Thatcher you are next,1
teacher:So you know what that means Thatcher when they say incline,1
teacher:Yeah;student:I know,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Go for it Delta,1
teacher:Say that again Denver;student:Dallas,1
teacher:You  know what;student:Isnt it normally just,1
teacher:Tyson,1
teacher:Clayton,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Yeah;student:Meters,1
teacher:Titan,1
teacher:Do you want to do 30 minutes,1
teacher:Lets start with Dakota,1
teacher:Yes Joyce,1
teacher:Once you have done that please stand up,1
teacher:Yeah;student:Okay,1
teacher:Yes Jude,1
teacher:So seven this going vertically,1
teacher:She saw these groups right here and shes like well if I put these together and kind of flip this one around and match them Is that right Jason,1
teacher:Alicia,1
teacher:Scarlet,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Carolina,1
teacher:Go for it,1
teacher:Yeah Gavin,1
teacher:Yeah Jude,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Okay Shilo,1
teacher:Carolina,1
teacher:Go for it,1
teacher:Yes Jude,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Yeah Campbell,1
teacher:Anybody know,1
teacher:Is everybody feeling okay about this graph so far,1
teacher:Okay any questions so far,1
teacher:Questions about this one,1
teacher:Any questions on this slide,1
teacher:Okay any questions on what makes a function not a function,1
teacher:Lapita  Im going to show yours,1
teacher:Okay any questions on this one,1
teacher:Does anyone have any questions on this one,1
teacher:Like I have to look through it to see but then on the other ones that should tell you like what the correct answer is okay,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions,1
teacher:questions on this,1
teacher:Even you have any questions,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions on this question,1
teacher:Is this a linear function,1
teacher:Is the rate of change constant,1
teacher:So every time and you might be thinking to yourself like Mr G why are you always writing in plus one right,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions on this one,1
teacher:Okay anybody have any questions about this one,1
teacher:We have any questions on this one,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:So in your equation instead of plus one can you write a plus 43,1
teacher:That sound good everybody,1
teacher:Lapita make sure you have a negative six in there Okay,1
teacher:Any questions about any of that,1
teacher:That means answering every inauidble question that means trying your best that means asking for help if youre confused about something okay,1
teacher:How are you doing today,1
teacher:Does that sound okay Cason,1
teacher:Okay are there any questions about these review sheets,1
teacher:What were you gonna say Shae,1
teacher:Any questions on this one,1
teacher:Its like how far away from your car you are is what this graph is showing okay,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions about that,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions,1
teacher:Selma,1
teacher:Okay any questions on this one before we move on to the next one,1
teacher:So as x goes up by one every time although youre gonna have to change your y intercept here Okay,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions so far before we finish off the equation,1
teacher:Is this a linear function,1
teacher:Or is the rate of change constant,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions,1
teacher:Okay any questions on this one for right now,1
teacher:So alright I see a lot of people saying the rise is four right,1
teacher:So rise is four run is zero can you divide by zero,1
teacher:So lets think about what this equation would be so because So remember we all of our equations are y equals mx plus b except in this case and the reason why is because does it make sense to write undefined into an equation,1
teacher:All right any questions on this slide so far,1
teacher:Okay any questions on how we connected these points to the graph and found the slope,1
teacher:Any questions so far on this one,1
teacher:Okay any questions so far,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions,1
teacher:A Go ahead Daphne when you write,1
teacher:Feeling okay about this one everybody,1
teacher:Do you get this part,1
teacher:Anybody have any questions on these problems so far,1
teacher:Are there any questions on what your homework is for tonight,1
teacher:So now lets talk about the Well first of all are there any questions on this equation or sorry on this graph,1
teacher:Or any questions about the next couple weeks in this class,1
teacher:Any questions on any of those five reminders or announcements so far,1
teacher:Abby any questions,1
teacher:Does anybody have any other questions,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions about that,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:And does anybody have any questions before I let you know when were gonna come back,1
teacher:In three weeks you spend 15 right,1
teacher:Anybody have any questions about slope before we get into some other questions for today,1
teacher:Any questions on slope so far,1
teacher:Okay so any questions about any questions about that,1
teacher:Okay sound good everybody,1
teacher:Any questions on this problem so far,1
teacher:Any questions so far in this one,1
teacher:Any questions on this one so far,1
teacher:Any questions so far before we talk about the equation,1
teacher:questions so far,1
teacher:Any questions on this one,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:Any questions at all,1
teacher:Okay any questions on that,1
teacher:Okay any questions so far,1
teacher:Any questions on this one anybody,1
teacher:Alright people how we feel about this one,1
teacher:Feeling Okay,1
teacher:Anybody have any questions,1
teacher:So would you agree that this is the same thing,1
teacher:Negative 2x plus zero,1
teacher:If Does that make sense,1
teacher:All right any questions on this one,1
teacher:And let me know if you have questions on those Okay,1
teacher:Marcus you getting there,1
teacher:Okay does anybody have any questions on this one,1
teacher:Okay any questions,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions,1
teacher:How do you feel like you are doing on this material From this week,1
teacher:So how do you feel like youre doing on this material from this week,1
teacher:So in the chat Id like you to write How do you feel like youre doing from one to five,1
teacher:Okay any questions so far,1
teacher:Anybody have any questions about any of that stuff,1
teacher:Any questions on this,1
teacher:Any questions about how we can go from y intercept and slope just right to the equation,1
teacher:any questions so far,1
teacher:Can I see some people fixing this Adam an Felix take a look take a look at my table here and how Im connecting it to these points okay,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:Any questions so far from anybody,1
teacher:That sound good everybody,1
teacher:Any questions on this one,1
teacher:Okay does anybody have any questions about why this one has a slope of zero,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:Okay any questions about that one,1
teacher:And thats kind of unnecessary right,1
teacher:Anybody have any questions in particular before before we fill in the table or the graph,1
teacher:So youre taking a close look at my graph okay,1
teacher:So Jackson go ahead and try to graph and put the table in correctly okay,1
teacher:Any questions on this one,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:How are we doing everyone,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions about those,1
teacher:Okay any questions on this,1
teacher:Alysa whats up,1
teacher:But yeah are there any questions so far,1
teacher:Are there any questions so far,1
teacher:Remember no repeats,1
teacher:So does every x value have one arrow,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions about this stuff,1
teacher:Do you have any questions about this stuff,1
teacher:Anybody have any questions about whats going on this week in class,1
teacher:Any questions any questions,1
teacher:Okay any questions so far on this one,1
teacher:Okay any questions anybody,1
teacher:And one of the biggest things in this section is just knowing that x is domain and y is the range right,1
teacher:How does that sound,1
teacher:Remember,1
teacher:Were doing okay on this one,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Jason,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:Okay any questions so far,1
teacher:Okay any questions about that so far,1
teacher:How are you doing,1
teacher:Okay any questions on that,1
teacher:And Asher if you can write in the Pear Deck if your Internets giving you troubles today then just pay attention to the Google meets Okay,1
teacher:Okay any questions on this one so far,1
teacher:Okay does anybody have any questions on this one,1
teacher:Okay any questions on how to write the equation of a horizontal line,1
teacher:All right any questions on X intercept down here,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:Or y intercept up here,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:Any questions so far on this one,1
teacher:Okay any questions on this first one,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions,1
teacher:But does anybody have any questions about these sorts of problems,1
teacher:Y axis at five y equals five,1
teacher:All right any questions so far,1
teacher:All goo on that one so far,1
teacher:Im going to start at this first column here and because I want half Im going to divide it by two okay,1
teacher:Does everybody agree,1
teacher:Anybody online have any questions,1
teacher:Lets start with you,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:The what;student:The three represents,1
teacher:The numerator;student:The numerator,1
teacher:Carson;student:Oh nevermind,1
teacher:You guys,1
teacher:How much is left;student:How much of the sandwich is left for Joe,1
teacher:So my number model is 56 times 12,1
teacher:Do you think its how much was left,1
teacher:Did you all hear that,1
teacher:All right who wants to go next,1
teacher:Cooper,1
teacher:Onefourth of a meter is blue;student:And then we finding a total area of meters in the room,1
teacher:Is that what you mean,1
teacher:So you guys added,1
teacher:Who would like to start,1
teacher:Do you need common denominators if youre multiplying;student:Well we tried to  common denominator,1
teacher:How many slices;student:How many pizza slices were,1
teacher:Twothirds of eight were Are you listening to me,1
teacher:You just would have three factors right,1
teacher:You guys that would be a multiplication comparison right;student:Hes huge,1
teacher:So youre learning intention today Eric will you read it for us,1
teacher:Just like the casserole problem right,1
teacher:And youre success criteria Anna would you read it for us,1
teacher:How you guys doing,1
teacher:Have you got a problem,1
teacher:Does that work;student:How much did Timmy have left,1
teacher:Are you guys now;student:Lets just multiply for the answer,1
teacher:You dont think;student:No I dont think at all,1
teacher:You guys done,1
teacher:would that help you think of it better,1
teacher:So youre going to have to split something up right,1
teacher:You got twothirds figure out  Okay,1
teacher:The larger whole question the pizza is somebody ate something right;student:What is the total area for the,1
teacher:Are you listening;student:The question would be,1
teacher:So you had this amount plus this amount right,1
teacher:So you would have this right,1
teacher:Does that make more sense to you,1
teacher:Alec,1
teacher:Did we get everybody,1
teacher:Did we do yours,1
teacher:Okay lets do yours,1
teacher:Of the chocolate bar;student:23 of chocolate bar,1
teacher:So would that work;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:If group B ate 56 of it could group A eat 23,1
teacher:Im sorry what;student:23 of the sixth,1
teacher:This should be 13,1
teacher:And group A ate one 13 of what was left right,1
teacher:And then this way we have 13 right,1
teacher:So the double shaded is what group A ate okay,1
teacher:So I could draw a picture of that right,1
teacher:I have some Oh wait you guys before we start this do you think you can create fraction multiplication number problems,1
teacher:This is what you were doing just now right,1
teacher:So we have that if there were 10 apples in a basket,1
teacher:Can we fix this up,1
teacher:So it would be plus right;student:It would be times,1
teacher:You added 10 more apples to that;student:And 10 more apples,1
teacher:Carson did you want to go next,1
teacher:Anybody else want to share,1
teacher:You guys ready to share,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:And she used the comparison right,1
teacher:Okay so do you guys want to go next,1
teacher:Who wants to go next,1
teacher:height okay;student:Height,1
teacher:Tom,1
teacher:Of an apple;student:Timmy had 23 of an apple,1
teacher:10 more apples;student:He got 10 more baskets,1
teacher:7 6 and 23,1
teacher:How many apples;student:How many apples,1
teacher:But did you ever tell me how many apples are in the basket,1
teacher:23 of an apple is in the basket;student:23 of,1
teacher:23 of the basket are filled with apples;student:like the basket apple,1
teacher:Okay so 10 What;student:How  does he have,1
teacher:We get some practice with a partner all right,1
teacher:And volume multiplication when were talking about volume were talking about threedimensional right,1
teacher:Landon,1
teacher:Volume of surface area,1
teacher:Times three,1
teacher:Can we divide by four Pi,1
teacher:Is that allowed,1
teacher:You do the square root of it right,1
teacher:You do the cubed root of it right,1
teacher:30,1
teacher:Do we have everything we need to find radius Or to find surface area,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Does that sound good,1
teacher:If youre either going to write greater than you need to tell me the relationship between the two expressions okay,1
teacher:This is confusing isnt it,1
teacher:Landon,1
teacher:So its going to be three times greater right;student:Youre finding,1
teacher:So this is kind of tricky because usually youve got this number over here right,1
teacher:Four thirds times what;student:The multiple of thirds and then Pi,1
teacher:Carson do you remember,1
teacher:That sound good,1
teacher:I think its like two thirds right,1
teacher:You go from there,1
teacher:So we want to solve for R  Okay,1
teacher:When you squared it right;student:When you square root it,1
teacher:Is this a square number,1
teacher:Is four a square number,1
teacher:So 35 equals R Okay,1
teacher:You could solve it originally,1
teacher:Thats what youre saying right,1
teacher:100000 squared miles;student:Probably  a 100000 square miles,1
teacher:50000000,1
teacher:Do you know this is a conference,1
teacher:One thing to think about before we actually find surface area 3963 miles is a lot of miles right,1
teacher:Whatd you say,1
teacher:50 million;student:I said 50 million,1
teacher:Yeah 197359 thousand Did you round up Sassaby,1
teacher:This is a huge number right,1
teacher:Cooper,1
teacher:Were adding;student:So if you had,1
teacher:So you solved it and then you used some logical thinking,1
teacher:I want to you to talk to your shoulder partner,1
teacher:Did you write them down;student:Do you want to say,1
teacher:Are you ready to share,1
teacher:A room with tires in it;student:Theres a room filled with  Did you say tires,1
teacher:Area;student:I feel like its kind of area,1
teacher:Each box is an equal group okay,1
teacher:Youre going to fix yours;student:I want to fix my,1
teacher:Go for it;student:I wrote mine,1
teacher:Cooper,1
teacher:Isaac,1
teacher:An equal group;student:I think it might be a division problem,1
teacher:A division problem;student:A division problem,1
teacher:Did anybody do an area problem,1
teacher:Okay did that work,1
teacher:Logan do you have yours,1
teacher:Okay are we good;student:34,1
teacher:Everybody,1
teacher:Im going to break into Our number is fourths right,1
teacher:So hes you telling you the equivalent fraction;student:And then you get 3 times 3 equals 9 for the numerator,1
teacher:Remember that,1
teacher:This is kind of similar right;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:Eli,1
teacher:This one,1
teacher:This is bigger;student:Yeah,1
teacher:This is bigger,1
teacher:Did yall hear that,1
teacher:Conversion,1
teacher:You want the bigger pieces right,1
teacher:This side;student:The left side,1
teacher:That side,1
teacher:So were multiplying this by more than one right,1
teacher:Youre working out your words right,1
teacher:Your explanation,1
teacher:Who had a convincing argument for their answer,1
teacher:Alec,1
teacher:Tom,1
teacher:Is it true,1
teacher:Everybody say Representation,1
teacher:Just choose two of the situations two of the number sentences to write a number story okay,1
teacher:Can you tell me if thats correct,1
teacher:Theyre the biggest numbers right;student:And the two eights up there because therere higher than the four,1
teacher:Did you guys get it,1
teacher:Do you think you need to practice this,1
teacher:Are these the ones that you divided,1
teacher:Does anybody have questions about that game,1
teacher:Do you guys feel the need to finish out your Did somebody not get to do it,1
teacher:Do you guys want to do it,1
teacher:Do you understand,1
teacher:So is that pretty clear,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:Isaac,1
teacher:Does it,1
teacher:Add;student:Add,1
teacher:Any questions about this,1
teacher:Is that correct;student:Because,1
teacher:Did you have a question,1
teacher:Come on up,1
teacher:And Aaron do you think that that is the best way for me to make this,1
teacher:Joey,1
teacher:Landon,1
teacher:Ka,1
teacher:Im sorry what,1
teacher:Joey,1
teacher:Did you guys all hear that,1
teacher:Say it again,1
teacher:Say it again Isaac,1
teacher:Logan,1
teacher:The largest;student:The largest divisor,1
teacher:I do;student:Youll get more more cake,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:So what youre going to do is play topic it with me,1
teacher:Whos ready to go;student:Yes,1
teacher:Aaron will you play with me please,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:You guys know what rules are right,1
teacher:So you have an idea of what your answer should look like right,1
teacher:That you redo it and to me it tells me that you have learned which is Mark right,1
teacher:Especially and this might be helpful when you are proving it,1
teacher:Okay so I have eight five and five right,1
teacher:So if I have eight five and five I could have I could make eight plus five over five which would be 13 over five right,1
teacher:Are you with me Aaron,1
teacher:Gavin,1
teacher:Not really because two of the cards are the same right,1
teacher:So would this be strategy,1
teacher:Did I just prove to you which one is bigger,1
teacher:You could play this game and figure out all the possibilities and do the highest point right,1
teacher:Its confusing right,1
teacher:Sophia,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:Maybe they just had a word wrong or they clearly just had a word wrong right Sophia,1
teacher:Okay so what part of the what kinds of prompts did Simone address;student:Maybe they could add like more words to make it make sense because my rule is the bigger the denominators or probably something different than denominators,1
teacher:Howard,1
teacher:And and then Im placing one on the bottom to make the largest fraction right,1
teacher:The largest fraction but the value of the fraction is the same as the quotient right,1
teacher:Not quotient right,1
teacher:Sophia,1
teacher:Maggie read it for me,1
teacher:George,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:Typically when you justify also you are doing some explanation right,1
teacher:So they change they switched it from having it be a division problem right,1
teacher:Are those two things related,1
teacher:Did you talk about similarities;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Landon,1
teacher:No one,1
teacher:So so if you Im sorry,1
teacher:George,1
teacher:Anna;student:I think its similar to a fraction because sometimes when we do,1
teacher:So shes just saying when if I understand you correctly youre just saying that a fraction is the numerator divided by the denominator,1
teacher:Isnt that related,1
teacher:Its the same thing right,1
teacher:Max,1
teacher:Okay;student:was saying you could make that a whole number then you would report the number as a fraction,1
teacher:Cooper,1
teacher:Im sorry what,1
teacher:Got it,1
teacher:Mia,1
teacher:Aaron,1
teacher:So you multiplied by eight yup,1
teacher:When you get a page will you please tell me so you can help the class,1
teacher:Which one are you doing,1
teacher:What are you doing,1
teacher:Are you guys sharing with each other once you have your lists of numbers done,1
teacher:Share with your neighbor,1
teacher:Are you working,1
teacher:Do you not know what to do,1
teacher:Did you read what multiples are,1
teacher:When youre done share it with your neighbor,1
teacher:So share your answers with your neighbors,1
teacher:I want the factor person to go first,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Nine 24ths does that work;student:Nine 24ths,1
teacher:A what,1
teacher:Brielle,1
teacher:Were you guys battling,1
teacher:Any questions about what you need to do,1
teacher:You need what;student:I,1
teacher:Do you have a question,1
teacher:Youre going to work with your shoulder partner,1
teacher:Im sorry what,1
teacher:Can you do it when,1
teacher:At some point,1
teacher:How were doing,1
teacher:Im sorry,1
teacher:Okay and lucky last,1
teacher:Because it represents the same thing right;student:Yeah I know,1
teacher:Yes who has two 14ths,1
teacher:Your favorite one of Isaacs;student:What was my,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Three Is that six 16ths,1
teacher:All right did you guys showdown yet,1
teacher:Joey,1
teacher:So every product has two factors right,1
teacher:Anybody want to take a guess,1
teacher:Im going to do what;student:Were going to put it to one eight,1
teacher:Joey,1
teacher:If you have 90 sevenths and youre adding them to 25ths thats a big number right,1
teacher:Is that right,1
teacher:Is one denominator a factor of the other,1
teacher:Is one denominator a factor of the other,1
teacher:Show me,1
teacher:Show me,1
teacher:Did you predict that,1
teacher:Show me,1
teacher:Show me;student:Not really,1
teacher:Show me,1
teacher:Show me,1
teacher:Show me;student:Thats a big number,1
teacher:Im sorry what,1
teacher:What;student:Were going to put it to one eight,1
teacher:Are you with me Isaac,1
teacher:So were going to take one fifth and we need it to have a denominator of 40 right,1
teacher:Okay so we cant add those right;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:Logan,1
teacher:Did we get them all;student:And I have three and 12,1
teacher:So does that seem kind of random like a random order,1
teacher:Are you with me Brody,1
teacher:Hello,1
teacher:Does two go into 36,1
teacher:Does three go into 36,1
teacher:Landon,1
teacher:Does four go into 36,1
teacher:Does six go into 36,1
teacher:Cooper,1
teacher:Landon,1
teacher:No you dont because theyre different sizes of pieces right;student:If you just add one third onto one eighth you dont really get an answer,1
teacher:So for instance if you have one half plus one third we cant add those right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Hows that sound,1
teacher:Does five go into 36,1
teacher:Anybody online have any questions,1
teacher:Whats that,1
teacher:Anybody have any questions about Sears before we start,1
teacher:These two lines,1
teacher:Three just half right;student:Three,1
teacher:Are there any other questions on this homework besides these first two,1
teacher:Are there any questions on this homework,1
teacher:And we use things like side side side right,1
teacher:everybody remember that,1
teacher:And then does anybody remember the one that didnt work,1
teacher:Remember this symbol right here,1
teacher:90 right,1
teacher:So if you know two angles the third one right,1
teacher:Did these triangles have the same angles Ian,1
teacher:So if this ones lets start with this one if this ones 90 and this ones 51 90 plus 51 gets us 141 right,1
teacher:DOes That number look familiar,1
teacher:Okay does anybody have any questions on angle angle similarity,1
teacher:Are these actually proportional,1
teacher:Do they look parallel in here,1
teacher:Is that equal to 32 over 24,1
teacher:So when youre looking at IJ and HG or GH are those lines going to be parallel,1
teacher:Emily,1
teacher:Everybody agree,1
teacher:Does it make sense that one half is exactly between negative three and four,1
teacher:Emily,1
teacher:Just sometimes its way faster like for zero and two if you think of it as a zero its like why not do that right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Four plus negative two is two,1
teacher:That sound good to everybody,1
teacher:Does that sound good to everybody,1
teacher:Lets go down to example two all right,1
teacher:Does that sound good to everybody for that rhombus,1
teacher:Everybody agree,1
teacher:Up four over three,1
teacher:Anybody online,1
teacher:Remember that from yesterday,1
teacher:Does that sound good everybody,1
teacher:Are those parallel,1
teacher:So are those fractions the same,1
teacher:four thirds;student:43rds,1
teacher:The angles everybody agree these angles are the same,1
teacher:Is that the same,1
teacher:is eight twice as big as six,1
teacher:Is 12 times 6 nine,1
teacher:this one becomes four thirds as well but theyre not all three the same right,1
teacher:Any questions on number one or number two so far,1
teacher:Anyone in here,1
teacher:Ryan wat do you think,1
teacher:Theyre the same right,1
teacher:Okay so do do those three angles match up with the three angles and the other triangle,1
teacher:any questions on number three,1
teacher:We need to we need an angle right,1
teacher:is six over 12 The same as five over 10,1
teacher:Theyre The same,1
teacher:PT  P The middle is the same N oK does that sound good,1
teacher:Can we split them up redraw them as two triangles,1
teacher:Is that the same as eight over six,1
teacher:This is twice as big as this right,1
teacher:Doesnt matter,1
teacher:and with the third angle be the same,1
teacher:Label the same,1
teacher:So to compared to three is that the same proportion as four over six,1
teacher:is two thirds the same as four Sixths,1
teacher:All right any questions on side angle side similarity,1
teacher:Is that equal to 24 over 12,1
teacher:is that equal to 10 over Five,1
teacher:Are those all the same,1
teacher:Just one right,1
teacher:two so that simplifies to be two over one right;student:two,1
teacher:Um All right any questions so far,1
teacher:Okay any questions so far,1
teacher:Okay are the triangles similar,1
teacher:Are they similar,1
teacher:vertical angles right;student:vertical angle,1
teacher:So Does everyone agree this is the same as this,1
teacher:Does everybody agree this angle is the same as this one,1
teacher:two over one right,1
teacher:You gotta have both parts right,1
teacher:Are those the same slope,1
teacher:Does everybody agree that three over negative four is the same as negative 34,1
teacher:By the Yaxis,1
teacher:Is it the same height as point B,1
teacher:Is it the same X,1
teacher:Questions on that one,1
teacher:Margaret,1
teacher:Question;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Does that sound good everybody,1
teacher:Marcus doing okay,1
teacher:Are these lines parallel,1
teacher:Are these lines parallel,1
teacher:Are these lines perpendicular,1
teacher:Are those perpendicular,1
teacher:Do they make a 90 degree on that,1
teacher:All right,1
teacher:Any questions on those,1
teacher:Is this split exactly in half,1
teacher:Any questions anybody online,1
teacher:You go backwards X up X to get to H Anybody online have questions on that one,1
teacher:Is that what youre saying,1
teacher:Yeah;student:Yes,1
teacher:Everybody agree so far,1
teacher:All right any questions anybody online so far,1
teacher:Does everybody that,1
teacher:All right now height is H So thats base B the height is H so O S thats your height of H And T W thats your height of H Everybody agree so far,1
teacher:Everybody online agree so far,1
teacher:Its labeled with O that means origin right,1
teacher:So point S  point S is on the Yaxis right,1
teacher:Say again,1
teacher:Everybody agree so far,1
teacher:B comma H Everybody agree so far,1
teacher:All right anybody online have any questions so far,1
teacher:Is I on the Yaxis,1
teacher:Its going to be negative right,1
teacher:Say it again Cardo,1
teacher:That makes sense so far,1
teacher:That one didnt work,1
teacher:Were you able to do all five River,1
teacher:Anybody have all four in here,1
teacher:Its a diagonal square right,1
teacher:Anybody have questions on these,1
teacher:Have these tortured anybody,1
teacher:Any questions so far on that one,1
teacher:Shane,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:Anybody in here neShane more time to write down these two parts,1
teacher:Emily,1
teacher:Is already with this so far,1
teacher:Is that line that I have in red is that actually a slope of two,1
teacher:Does it actually go up to over one,1
teacher:That work,1
teacher:All right,1
teacher:Are these opposite sides parallel,1
teacher:Any questions so far,1
teacher:Anybody see the square,1
teacher:Its a challenge to explain which dots on pictures like this right;student:And then the dot inbetween the right and the left,1
teacher:Emily,1
teacher:Isosceles triangle anybody see the isosceles triangle in here,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Tricky,1
teacher:Anybody in here have the isosceles triangle one,1
teacher:This one;student:Its the two on the farleft side,1
teacher:This one;student:And then the one across,1
teacher:Did anybody get the parallelogram,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Does that look right so far;student:Thank you,1
teacher:Should I go on,1
teacher:You think so;student:I think so,1
teacher:Are there any other dots that are vertical,1
teacher:The far right so these two lines are parallel right;student:The farright ones,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Did anybody see the isosceles right triangle in there,1
teacher:Is this the one Im drawing up;student:Move onto the left two on the right and then draw it up,1
teacher:Everybody get that one,1
teacher:Trapezoid anybody see the trapezoid in here,1
teacher:Thats all good everybody,1
teacher:What is this entire side,1
teacher:Is that the same as three to five,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:Do we know the base of the triangle in part B,1
teacher:Okay do we know the height,1
teacher:Pythagorean theorem;student:Pythagorean theorem,1
teacher:Is there a faster way than Pythagorean theorem,1
teacher:Do I know the base now of the triangle,1
teacher:Got to look at the number of parts right,1
teacher:Is this helping everybody,1
teacher:ABC right,1
teacher:This is actually a Pythagorean triple its a little bit tricky but I think its worth talking about right,1
teacher:Any questions on the first four,1
teacher:For example one the reason why I think this is a cool connection is do we know very much about the triangle example one,1
teacher:Do we know the base,1
teacher:Do we know the height,1
teacher:And this would be the hypotenuse right,1
teacher:Any questions on part A,1
teacher:Times seven;student:1880 x 7,1
teacher:Like this right,1
teacher:X comma Y changes to X comma negative Y right,1
teacher:Positive one third right,1
teacher:The green line and the blue line do those cross at 90 degrees,1
teacher:This pattern makes it so that two lines cross at 90 degree angles  projection right,1
teacher:Does that sound good to everybody,1
teacher:Sliding it,1
teacher:Does everyone agree those are the correct points for those two,1
teacher:And is that eight negative one,1
teacher:And so for point B right here you get a point right there B right,1
teacher:Is that blue shape actually over three down five,1
teacher:Is there any questions so far for number one,1
teacher:Does everybody have that triangle started,1
teacher:Is it easier to just take the shape and look at it and move it to 180 degrees,1
teacher:Thats pretty challenging right,1
teacher:So seven negative four zero negative two because zero is neither positive nor negative four comma two right,1
teacher:you with me,1
teacher:Not quite because then G would match up with F and F would match up with G But its a reflection right,1
teacher:13 point what;student:Oh 1316,1
teacher:Do I know the base of this triangle,1
teacher:Do I know the height of this triangle,1
teacher:Exactly;student:I got 768,1
teacher:Did you do 108 instead of 1078;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Sophie what did you say 215 point,1
teacher:Point six;student:Six,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions on those trigonometry questions,1
teacher:Its going to be on a quiz next week al right,1
teacher:The quiz for today or the quiz for tomorrow is on pages one through 10 right,1
teacher:Can you do one,1
teacher:Any questions on that,1
teacher:A lot of overlap with circles right,1
teacher:Does everybody agree thats the circumference,1
teacher:Is that a maximum,1
teacher:Is that the biggest circle that we could draw all the way,1
teacher:Atmosphere okay,1
teacher:The Northern hemisphere right,1
teacher:Anybody else get that too,1
teacher:2156,1
teacher:Does that makes sense,1
teacher:Is this a special right triangle at all,1
teacher:So lets think about trigonometry Ana,1
teacher:Is that a right triangle,1
teacher:Okay do we have all the info we need,1
teacher:From this step Becca,1
teacher:Is that  what you got Becca;student:Its,1
teacher:Im getting 5852 does that work for everyone,1
teacher:What was that AJ,1
teacher:One,1
teacher:The opposite angle is 120;student:The opposite angle is 120,1
teacher:We need to find this part right,1
teacher:Do we know the height of the parallelogram,1
teacher:Trapezoid,1
teacher:Isosceles trapezoid right,1
teacher:Do I know the height of his trapezoid,1
teacher:Do I know base 1 and base 2,1
teacher:Do we know any of those sides of that triangle,1
teacher:Do we know the base,1
teacher:yeah angle C its the same angle for both of them right,1
teacher:If we reflected B over the X axis it would be right here right,1
teacher:Does it cross of 90 degrees,1
teacher:Are they related,1
teacher:Did the Y values change,1
teacher:Yeah they flipped right,1
teacher:Okay that sound good everybody,1
teacher:All right that sound good everybody,1
teacher:Everybody have this graph,1
teacher:Does everybody agree so far,1
teacher:Everybody online doing okay,1
teacher:Anybody have any questions,1
teacher:Were going to take the red shape  you with me,1
teacher:Everybody got similar shape,1
teacher:Am I off at all on this one,1
teacher:Just slid it right,1
teacher:Its like everything matches up perfectly right,1
teacher:Does that sound good to everybody,1
teacher:Do the X values stay the same,1
teacher:Is it a straight line,1
teacher:Does anybody see a relationship between these points,1
teacher:I think it flipped right,1
teacher:Two,1
teacher:Can we divide that by,1
teacher:Probably three right,1
teacher:B C D similar to triangle A  C E  Okay any questions in here on these,1
teacher:Anybody online have any questions on these six practice problems,1
teacher:Does that look good everybody,1
teacher:Is that the same exact shape,1
teacher:Or is just the Ys,1
teacher:Is that the same exact shape,1
teacher:Anybody online have any questions so far on this first example,1
teacher:Everybody here doing okay,1
teacher:That sound good everybody,1
teacher:Vertical line right,1
teacher:Did I just take this shape and slide it over here exactly,1
teacher:I just took this shape and moved it over here,1
teacher:Does that shape look okay to everyone,1
teacher:Do you agree its the same thing as Y equals one X plus zero,1
teacher:Is that the same thing as Y equals X,1
teacher:Before you do anything more I think its important to think about Do these points that we just graphed even make sense,1
teacher:The same thing,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Does that line connect at a 90 degree angle,1
teacher:Does it make a 90 degree angle with the blue line,1
teacher:Does everybody agree that green line has a slope of one half,1
teacher:So Id like you to look at your diagram here and just think to yourself for 10 seconds 20 seconds is this the correct line of reflection,1
teacher:What do we think,1
teacher:Is that the correct line,1
teacher:It looks like its right in the middle right,1
teacher:So just because I say its right in the middle thats not a very convincing argument right,1
teacher:Is that line of reflection,1
teacher:Is that the perpendicular bisector of the blue line,1
teacher:Does it cross right in the middle,1
teacher:Does it cross at 90 degrees,1
teacher:Does the line of reflection go through the midpoint,1
teacher:Its a rotation right;student:You rotated it,1
teacher:From the first to the other one did I reflect it exactly,1
teacher:Did I just take the first shape and slide it to the other one,1
teacher:Was that a slide that we did,1
teacher:Do those look like the same triangle,1
teacher:But its not a slide right,1
teacher:Does everyone see,1
teacher:Everybody agree with that line so far,1
teacher:Say it again;student:Flip flop them and count each plot,1
teacher:The sign;student:They switched their value,1
teacher:Is that the same exact shape everybody,1
teacher:Any questions on number two so far,1
teacher:Am I off a little bit,1
teacher:Down here,1
teacher:Okay is that the same exact shape now,1
teacher:What does the rule at the bottom of the page say,1
teacher:X Y turns into,1
teacher:When we reflect over the X axis what does it say at the bottom,1
teacher:X what,1
teacher:This point is this seven comma negative three,1
teacher:Oh for M,1
teacher:You know what,1
teacher:Remember surface areas,1
teacher:And I would like to bring my family over for dinner to have tuna noodle casserole and do you guys know what I said;student:But I dont,1
teacher:Alright random name generator going to Rene,1
teacher:Rene when you have your answer were going to type it in the chat,1
teacher:And everybody else when you have your answer type it in the chat,1
teacher:Alright Bruce go,1
teacher:Braxton you got the same answer as Bruce right,1
teacher:Anyone but Robbie,1
teacher:Robbie you have something else to say,1
teacher:Is there enough for each person to get two,1
teacher:So youve taken away 500 and you have one left on the table,1
teacher:Then youre gonna ask yourself again can I give each of my  five people 100,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:can I give Can I split this 100 up for five people;student:Wait what was the question again,1
teacher:Is that possible physically,1
teacher:Is anybody still writing down this problem,1
teacher:Can I put four into what I have leftover,1
teacher:All right Eden can you tell us your your idea for a game,1
teacher:So I have zero leftover,1
teacher:Is it about division,1
teacher:because all were doing or Im sorry Arethra,1
teacher:Say again Sarah;student:Im confused why you put the lines,1
teacher:So now that I have my new numbers on my area model can I solve for this rectangle,1
teacher:What do you guys think,1
teacher:Who said nine;student:9,1
teacher:Okay so can we figure out what the inside of this square equals,1
teacher:Are you sure,1
teacher:We need to find what the inside of all three of these boxes equal,1
teacher:All right how am I,1
teacher:Do I know,1
teacher:So weve done all them,1
teacher:Who can type in the chat Say me  If you know what division is,1
teacher:Yes Arethra;student:T,1
teacher:do you think Im going to get a different answer,1
teacher:If instead of making them into two groups I divide them all up into groups of two,1
teacher:Count them with me,1
teacher:So this is showing two groups of Six right,1
teacher:Can I put four into it,1
teacher:Colton what is your question,1
teacher:Phoebe do you have a question or Are you just clicking,1
teacher:I wants you to turn on your cameras and I want you to either nod if you think it does or shake your head if you think it does not,1
teacher:Does one and one half 12 eighths and three halves name the same amount of pizza,1
teacher:Evy My question for the group and why theyre all nodding their heads are shaking their heads is im saying is one and one half 128ths and three halves naming the same amount of pizza,1
teacher:Do you guys agree that if I were to take these two halves and put them together they would equal one hole,1
teacher:Alright Asher I havent talked to you a whole lot today,1
teacher:Asher helped me out here,1
teacher:See them on my board,1
teacher:It is going to be person one;student:Um Can you please color one piece from each pizza green,1
teacher:Okay Asher is there enough pieces left for each of my other five people to get an equal amount is the first person;student:six,1
teacher:So what color do you want the person two,1
teacher:So if I split what I have left If I split these even like this am I going to be able to give equal parts to the rest of the people,1
teacher:So are you saying 4 in each;student:Oh a inauidble cut like that much and much,1
teacher:Is that gonna split evenly among my people,1
teacher:Is there enough pizza for all six of my people to get one whole pizza,1
teacher:Is there enough pizza for each of my people to get one whole pizza,1
teacher:Does one and one half 12 eighths and three halves mean the same amount of pizza,1
teacher:Or is that leftover,1
teacher:Evy is that a hand up,1
teacher:Evy is that a hand up Or is that leftover,1
teacher:Phoebe do you have a question or Are you just clicking,1
teacher:can I put 4 into one,1
teacher:If I have one Can I put four inside of it,1
teacher:I have zero can I put 4 in it,1
teacher:And then Do I have anything else to bring down,1
teacher:Addy,1
teacher:lets start with you Addy,1
teacher:Follow me so far,1
teacher:Which one doesnt matter;student:So I split one pizza in half,1
teacher:And then did you split them another time;student:Yes,1
teacher:Okay so there are eight at each pizza,1
teacher:And you said youre saying that you each got eight,1
teacher:Brenda and Angie cut them into pieces Like you would normally cut a pizza right,1
teacher:Okay so then Brenda youre telling me that you got eight pieces right,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:So this is Sofias pizza,1
teacher:So you said you split them in half Yes,1
teacher:One half;student:So like split split all of them into like like one half or something like that,1
teacher:someone other than June,1
teacher:Cadence give me a two digit number please,1
teacher:Okay Paige;student:I need to eat less and then theyll eat less,1
teacher:What about you,1
teacher:Okay so are you saying Paige that adults eat more than children;student:Theyre Bigger,1
teacher:So does it mean that every single American every single person that lives in this country eats two and a half pounds of food per day,1
teacher:Do you think that you and everyone in your family or everyone in your community everybody in our school everybody in our class Do you think that everybody eats five and a half pounds per day,1
teacher:So Dakota can I can I say what you just said in the chat,1
teacher:Do you think some people might eat more than five and a half pounds of food per day,1
teacher:Can someone volunteer to read this first sentence at the very top of my screen,1
teacher:Alright Paige,1
teacher:Tell me;student:I think I know,1
teacher:Haven Haven,1
teacher:Okay now I dont really want to around the kids in our class because if I say that we have about 30 kids in our class is that accurate,1
teacher:Is this a little bit easier to solve than 25 times 25,1
teacher:Evie can I do that;student:the way To solve it by separating it like that like three times two equals six,1
teacher:Can I just say okay three times two equals six and zero times five equals zero,1
teacher:Do you think that every year people eat 2000 pounds of food per year,1
teacher:Can I do that,1
teacher:Okay do you guys think that any of this information ever changes;student:And its just like Did I really eat that much food,1
teacher:Kole,1
teacher:Oh sorry Rebecca can you say that one more time,1
teacher:Rebecca can you say that one more time,1
teacher:Okay Rebecca,1
teacher:Can you say that again,1
teacher:Did anyone use multiplication to solve this,1
teacher:Or to think about it,1
teacher:Okay so Marcos can I rephrase what you said;student:And when I got to 60 times nine I got the answer of 540,1
teacher:And you can tell me if thats what you mean or not,1
teacher:Were you thinking okay in these boxes,1
teacher:Marcos so far,1
teacher:Were you still talking,1
teacher:Dakota can we hear from you today,1
teacher:Dakota can you start at the top and read out loud,1
teacher:Does any of this information surprise anybody,1
teacher:Oh can you say that one more time;student:i agree with Kaylee,1
teacher:Anybody else;student:Because like how do you eat that much per day or per year,1
teacher:Can you say that again,1
teacher:So its not three times 25;student:we cannot do that because we have to do 30 times 25,1
teacher:Mason you think you have a faster way than me writing 30 25 times;student:I do,1
teacher:Charlie do you drink a lot of milk every week,1
teacher:Major,1
teacher:Did you eat two eggs,1
teacher:two glasses of milk or two pieces of candy,1
teacher:Hunter Im still talking to you buddy,1
teacher:Kelly are you here,1
teacher:Kelly please unmute and talk to us,1
teacher:Kelly do you need help,1
teacher:Can you tell us,1
teacher:Okay Kelly which one are you looking at your eggs or milk or your candy;student:Im not sure,1
teacher:Kelly which one are you looking at,1
teacher:Eggs milk or candy,1
teacher:How many eggs do you eat,1
teacher:Five;student:5,1
teacher:Absolutely Sarah;student:Can I add on,1
teacher:All right Charlie start us off;student:Oh when I multiplied my milk I guess Im gonna drink a lot of Milk,1
teacher:Because remember my zeros rule,1
teacher:Fatima Whats up,1
teacher:Give me a green checkmark when you have your numbers out in front of you,1
teacher:So 30 Lets see are 2 30s equals 60,1
teacher:And you guys are telling me that I have to count by 30 25 times,1
teacher:Does my answer of 60 makes sense,1
teacher:Alright lets go Camille;student:I have another way,1
teacher:And then lets go to Dakota,1
teacher:Okay now you guys ready,1
teacher:Dean what do you need buddy,1
teacher:And Franc give me another two digit number please,1
teacher:Is that related to what were talking about right now;student:I was going to say that isnt pizza Italian,1
teacher:Forrest,1
teacher:Do you guys think I can use my zero role to solve this problem,1
teacher:I want you to take me in the chat and Im gonna call on somebody,1
teacher:Evie give it a shot,1
teacher:The three questions that you guys had Were how many eggs Did you eat in the last seven days,1
teacher:How many cups of milk Did you drink in the last seven days,1
teacher:And how many pieces of candy Did you eat in the last seven days,1
teacher:type it to me in the chat if you would like a chance to try to explain that,1
teacher:So with this so Mari and Lucas T Did you guys have any equation to solve this problem;student:So thats how we got the answer of 120,1
teacher:Zoey whats not clicking,1
teacher:Are all of those pieces equal,1
teacher:Cole do you want to read it to us,1
teacher:Corey;student:LCM,1
teacher:Derrick are you there,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Corey,1
teacher:Do you want to take this one,1
teacher:Can I get somebody to read this one for us,1
teacher:Adelle do you want to read this one,1
teacher:Are you there Douglas,1
teacher:So you were mostly looking at the numbers,1
teacher:And were going to start with our discussion about these two problems when yall come back this afternoon Right,1
teacher:Whats up,1
teacher:Anabelle lets start with you,1
teacher:Go for it please,1
teacher:Cooper,1
teacher:Do you guys have any questions before we move on,1
teacher:The amount of something compared to something else;student:For example if you had like a mixture of,1
teacher:So you dont always have to do the table you can use the division ladder,1
teacher:16,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Now have you guys snap on every third beat okay,1
teacher:Every other third beat;student:I think that theyll clap on every other third beat,1
teacher:Do you think that theyll ever clap on the same beat,1
teacher:Id love to hear from somebody in MathLand,1
teacher:I would agree with you that its common multiple because were counting by that number right,1
teacher:So the snaps they did beat two right,1
teacher:So did we ever have sound on the same beat,1
teacher:Adriana go for it,1
teacher:Rob,1
teacher:When you have numbers and you multiply both of them you got it,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:What do you guys think around here;student:Because you want to find a common multiple of six and eight,1
teacher:Does that sound doable,1
teacher:Paper cups;student:The cups sold after the day,1
teacher:Do these line up at all,1
teacher:Yes whats your question;student:I have a question,1
teacher:Lindsey,1
teacher:Yeah Cooper,1
teacher:Go for it;student:Sure,1
teacher:Can I come back to you for the fourth one;student:Oh,1
teacher:Greta did that answer your question sweetie,1
teacher:Go for it,1
teacher:So you thought about dividing it in half and then dividing it in half again to get 4 pieces,1
teacher:Do you guys have any questions you would like to talk about before we move on,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Do you agree with that statement do you disagree with that statement or do you have a question about it,1
teacher:Do you agree with the order in white paint to blue paint,1
teacher:Should 2 come first and 6 come second,1
teacher:Edgar do you agree disagree or have a question about that one,1
teacher:Could be simplify it and have 3 cups for 3 tablespoons of blue paint for every 1 cup of white paint,1
teacher:You could right,1
teacher:And just have that part right and simplify it,1
teacher:Do you agree disagree or have a question about that one Juliet,1
teacher:Go for it Greta,1
teacher:Did you have a chance to think about this one,1
teacher:Is Gabriella here,1
teacher:Everything you need is in Google Classroom okay,1
teacher:So that would kind of be sorting it by color right,1
teacher:But then you would count them right,1
teacher:So for every five green there are five blue right,1
teacher:Do you see in the first statement how purple come first,1
teacher:You have 12 pencils and nine colored pencils,1
teacher:So you have two notebooks,1
teacher:You have 14 basketballs;student:Mine was the ratio of footballs to basketballs is five to 14,1
teacher:So Im going play a beat and youre going to clap on every other beat okay,1
teacher:Crew how are you feeling,1
teacher:How are you feeling about being able to compare ratios using ratio language or quantities using ratio language,1
teacher:Yeah whats up,1
teacher:Do you have an answer you would like to share or do you have a question for me,1
teacher:What were you saying then,1
teacher:You mean 24 divided by 4;student:So what I do is I kind of think of 14 times 24 as 4 divided by 24,1
teacher:So if we are finding one Go ahead Charlie,1
teacher:You know what;student:Thats basically saying 24 divided by 4,1
teacher:How are you feeling about using ratio language to be able to compare quantities,1
teacher:So the actual like the actual act of drawing it;student:But like Im not really sure how you made six six pieces of pizza,1
teacher:So were going to do a little activity and were going to keep a steady beat okay,1
teacher:Tony,1
teacher:Up or down,1
teacher:One times 12 is 12,1
teacher:Thumbs up,1
teacher:Thumbs up equals 12,1
teacher:Which one should I use,1
teacher:What should I use,1
teacher:Lets see pick one for us River,1
teacher:Which factors should I use,1
teacher:River which factor should I use,1
teacher:Am I going to multiply them,1
teacher:Am I going to add them,1
teacher:Jennifer do you want another chance,1
teacher:If you know what we do with this four I want you to raise your hand,1
teacher:Yes;student:T,1
teacher:Paulina,1
teacher:Hello,1
teacher:Alicia,1
teacher:One times 12 equals 12,1
teacher:Thumbs up if youre like Yeah one times 12 is 12,1
teacher:But there are a lot more equal than this right,1
teacher:If you know I want you to raise your hand,1
teacher:Only three people remember,1
teacher:Okay so six tenths;student:I mean,1
teacher:Darnell,1
teacher:Oh so do we need to know the definition of denominator to be able to figure out what Im asking;student:The new denominator would be which one the top one or the bottom one,1
teacher:Bonnie,1
teacher:You ready,1
teacher:Arcane,1
teacher:Are there anymore,1
teacher:Do they have any numbers in common Janessa,1
teacher:So wait do I see a four up here in this one,1
teacher:Lets see lets go to Jackie,1
teacher:I cant;student:So you cant divide two and two,1
teacher:Leslie do you have a question,1
teacher:I should see more cameras on give me a thumbs up or thumbs down,1
teacher:Karla Hello,1
teacher:So both of these look like theyre greater than one half right,1
teacher:When you have an idea I want you to raise your hand,1
teacher:Ooh Donna can I do rectangles;student:And we you do 10 on the other one,1
teacher:So while I dont have a hundred here can we visualize how small the pieces are,1
teacher:So Donna do I go three out of seven on this side,1
teacher:So can I compare these two together,1
teacher:If I just have fivea hundredths and twoa hundredths could you tell me which one was smaller,1
teacher:Do they share the same denominator;student:But,1
teacher:Now do you guys agree now that fiftyone hundredths is way bigger than fiveone hundredths,1
teacher:London,1
teacher:London;student:Did you call me,1
teacher:London if I were to draw a picture would that help me,1
teacher:So London do I have enough in this one whole to color in three,1
teacher:Is this a whole piece colored in,1
teacher:Jose you here,1
teacher:All right Jose;student:Wait I think I remember,1
teacher:So two and two fourths;student:Two fourths and the two in the side,1
teacher:All right Donna can you help me out here,1
teacher:Now can I compare these three pictures,1
teacher:said Can I use rectangles instead of circles,1
teacher:All right lets go to Geo,1
teacher:Adeline,1
teacher:Two one thousandths;student:The two one thousandths,1
teacher:Are these pieces really big or are they really small,1
teacher:Tracy;student:If you fill in two in 1000 its going to be tiny,1
teacher:Did that change your mind at all,1
teacher:Did that change your mind,1
teacher:Did you see what we just did,1
teacher:Emery,1
teacher:Aries,1
teacher:Sandy what did you say in the chat,1
teacher:Victoria,1
teacher:So does it make sense,1
teacher:Does it make sense if I say Okay from least to greatest means the smallest to the biggest,1
teacher:Pedro do you have something to add or you have a question,1
teacher:All right Pedro help me out;student:Oh I know,1
teacher:So we have   a picture and weve talked about two of them okay,1
teacher:So lets do number one together who can read number one on my screen Meaghan read it out loud and proud,1
teacher:So if this says for every cup of white paint there are 2 tablespoons of blue paint do you feel like thats true,1
teacher:Can you hear me now,1
teacher:Any other questions,1
teacher:Then that;student:Yes,1
teacher:Would you know that that guy is the same as the blue triangle with,1
teacher:and Y just flipped,1
teacher:Which means you know that guy that guy that guy and that guy;student:Yes,1
teacher:Would you know that that guy doesnt really play on with the other guys because its the isosceles triangle but that one gives you that that that and that,1
teacher:What;student:Because you never told us it was radical three,1
teacher:Have you heard the word,1
teacher:Have you heard the word,1
teacher:Have you heard the word;student:Ive heard  close to,1
teacher:You havent the word;student:No,1
teacher:Have you heard the word before,1
teacher:Have you heard the word,1
teacher:Have you heard it before,1
teacher:Have you heard this word before;student:Yes,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:Then that;student:Yes,1
teacher:Have you heard this word before,1
teacher:Would you know that that has the exact same X and Y values just the X is negative and the Y is positive;student:Yes,1
teacher:Take a little longer but could you get there;student:Itll take a little bit longer to,1
teacher:Right there right,1
teacher:You get any the idea of the symmetry of the unit circle,1
teacher:Do you agree that the red that goes backwards is the same as that red and that the blue that goes down is the same as that blue,1
teacher:and they were both negative,1
teacher:Do you see whats going on,1
teacher:Discuss quiz question in your groups,1
teacher:Okay would it be true for that;student:Yes thats my point,1
teacher:Theres your picture in your head do those two dots have the same cosine,1
teacher:They have the same sine is this an identity;student:They have the same sine,1
teacher:Now is that an identity,1
teacher:sine;student:You do 180 plus theta then this cosine is one half negative one half,1
teacher:Could you fill this in if I gave you a blank one of these right now made it a quiz,1
teacher:Could you go like this and make all the angles and degrees fill out here;student:Yes,1
teacher:30 45 60 you could do that;student:Yes,1
teacher:could you do that,1
teacher:Would you know that that spot right there has an X value of radical three over two and Y value of one half,1
teacher:Boys any questions,1
teacher:Is there something you dont understand,1
teacher:Can I help you with anything,1
teacher:Somebody I havent heard from in a while maybe,1
teacher:Paul alright go ahead,1
teacher:Kind of by intuition;student:I got one,1
teacher:Theres a total of 260 kids who have zero siblings right,1
teacher:The 300th number right;student:300,1
teacher:right,1
teacher:Alright what about this one,1
teacher:Whos lucky,1
teacher:That analysis was perfect in that the same number of the 300 right,1
teacher:The schools had different populations right,1
teacher:Lincoln school had 10 out of out of 300 people with four siblings which is roughly one out of every 30 kids right,1
teacher:Did I mess that up;student:C,1
teacher:The reasoning in tangent is a little bit harder than the reasoning in sine or cosine right;student:A trick tock,1
teacher:People who get right answers on this test have little targets okay,1
teacher:Tangent of theta would be 1 right,1
teacher:Respectively easy maybe,1
teacher:You remembered median was the middle number;student:Okay so I genuinely was not entirely sure but theres five things and is in the middle and that was the middle of the siblings,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:Are you ready to do this or not,1
teacher:Youre really hanging in there,1
teacher:You seriously know a lot of math things like do you know how to factor,1
teacher:If you see something that looks like it could be factorable should you maybe think about factoring it;student:Yes,1
teacher:Are you sure that thats going to work,1
teacher:Should you being afraid that its not the right thing keep you from trying it,1
teacher:Do you know how to simplify and distribute,1
teacher:Will you by the time this test comes around in about three weeks know a whole bunch of equivalent identities that you could substitute in,1
teacher:Can you write an identity based on those two dots;student:Yes,1
teacher:Yes do you want to do it,1
teacher:Why is that not turn into a negative cos2   is that what youre asking;student:I thought the cos2   would be positive not negative because if it were 1 cos2   then it would be,1
teacher:Whats the message,1
teacher:Did anybody look at this from the very first step and think about distributing that tangent to both of those,1
teacher:PAMP 51,1
teacher:Or you just add them together;student:Wait this one read it like that,1
teacher:need to keep going,1
teacher:Is my key wrong,1
teacher:Piper,1
teacher:1 if we were looking at the tangent of 1 we wouldnt be saying how big is the red line compared to the green line;student:Whats the,1
teacher:Same Y do those two dots have the same Y;student:Y,1
teacher:Do the two dots have the same X,1
teacher:On this is it possible to isolate the radicals,1
teacher:Its impossible to fully isolate the radicals so you are in a boat on this problem where when you square both sides you better not just distribute the exponent right,1
teacher:Now at this step is it possible to isolate the radical,1
teacher:Any other questions about that;student:I say that and then,1
teacher:The 6;student:Where did you get the 6,1
teacher:Okay when I do that distributing out I get 3 x and 3 x thats where I get the nine from right,1
teacher:When I go like this 3 x3 x right;student:Yes,1
teacher:I just want to point this out to you so that when you look at it this weekend which you will you dont just go like  I dont have no idea what that jeopardy gobble is  Okay,1
teacher:That guy right there right,1
teacher:Am I starting to see the shape of the quadratic,1
teacher:I get the vertex of a quadratic by doing b2a combo plug right,1
teacher:You do b2a and then you plug that value back in here and itll spit out what the y of the vertex is right,1
teacher:I do b2a I get 2 2 because b2 negative of negative right,1
teacher:Is it easier to plug one into that,1
teacher:Do I see my beautiful parabola,1
teacher:Does that make that anything bad at the beginning,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:I could if I wanted to get everything to the lefthand side and set it  0 right,1
teacher:Do I need to actually plug that back in and show it;student:No,1
teacher:If you see my little picture up here Im going to cut it in half okay,1
teacher:If we asked you to do in interval notation and you did that have you followed directions,1
teacher:Might I still give you full credit,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Now if we flip this around and made it be  0 then it s true here and here right;student:greater than,1
teacher:If I asked you to solve this do you think you could,1
teacher:You could;student:We could,1
teacher:If I asked you to solve this do you think you could;student:Yes,1
teacher:If I ask you to graph this quadratic could you do that,1
teacher:Is that even in this unit;student:Yes,1
teacher:If I ask you to factor this quartic is that part of this unit,1
teacher:That was part of the last unit right;student:No,1
teacher:Is  17 thirds going to make that be 0,1
teacher:Is seventeen thirds equal to  8,1
teacher:Is 17 thirds going to make that  0,1
teacher:You ve still got to make sure that you train yourself to go back and check that because would that have been a problem,1
teacher:Do you know what youre supposed to do,1
teacher:Can you do it correctly and what mistakes do you make,1
teacher:Any math questions,1
teacher:Pick whos next;student:Yes,1
teacher:Whos next Isaac;student:Leave the top behind,1
teacher:Talk amongst yourselves for a second;student:One,1
teacher:Ready for a challenge;student:Negative one,1
teacher:Dont you thinkhaving some writing along with your explanation might help you,1
teacher:What;student:So if you cancel out all the threes,1
teacher:The green is pie over six tell me when to stop,1
teacher:You should be yelling at me,1
teacher:Stop;student:Its taken Were fine with you taking 15 minutes to go around the circle,1
teacher:If this was just positive four thirds I would be down there right,1
teacher:Okay does everybody know when to yell stop at me;student:Go around three times or a binder to,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Really;student:Stop,1
teacher:Thats 12 pie over 6 right,1
teacher:Do the green dot and the purple dot have the same cosine right now;student:The cosine is X,1
teacher:Okay pick the next person;student:I want to do the next one just right away,1
teacher:Great pick the next person Luke;student:Just kidding,1
teacher:Luke go,1
teacher:Who wants to volunteer to do that,1
teacher:Which one is that;student:No,1
teacher:When you have youre wondering about this side,1
teacher:Youre okay to get to here;student:Well yes I got that part and I ended up with,1
teacher:You are here;student:Donald Trump Im,1
teacher:Is this another radical right there;student:I just wanted two questions on this one because I got  this one I got really stumped on its same with this one,1
teacher:You know what;student:Tell me why I can do all this stuff from all the  units but my test,1
teacher:Do you guys have a math question,1
teacher:Can somebody other than Luke,1
teacher:If you have  radical x plus one and you are forced to distribute that out you have to  right;student:Dont date someone in high school,1
teacher:Listen you get to have one of these okay,1
teacher:Whats that,1
teacher:Whats that,1
teacher:Hey if you did not get an AP form back you got to give me five minutes into the class Ill get it to you okay,1
teacher:Are we ready to go over the problem,1
teacher:Wait you went back and read;student:after I determined it being either C or D I went back and then reread less than or equal to so I figured itd be D,1
teacher:How many people would have thought to do that off the top of their head,1
teacher:Monday youre taking level threes you will come in here the room will be in nice neat rows and good old Mr Huff will be your Mr Strathom okay,1
teacher:Mari Can you try one more time,1
teacher:Is the tangent of 5 the same as the tangent of 1,1
teacher:Does 4 have the same tangent as 1,1
teacher:So again;student:I can think of A composite number,1
teacher:is to a factor of 25,1
teacher:class,1
teacher:it is;student:Yes,1
teacher:Can I count by twos to get to 25,1
teacher:3,1
teacher:So AJ are there any more factors of 25,1
teacher:Yes;student:Miss Cornish,1
teacher:Gabby do you meanGabby just watched my board Okay,1
teacher:Yes;student:T,1
teacher:type it in the chat,1
teacher:Marlowe,1
teacher:Missy what are your notes say,1
teacher:what;student:It is inaudible,1
teacher:Do you have the notes written down,1
teacher:Yeah so can we just say more than two factors;student:A lot of even numbers,1
teacher:Yes or no,1
teacher:43,1
teacher:What was it;student:Um 17,1
teacher:Alright so Janessa are there any other factor pairs for five,1
teacher:Angela Are there any more factor pairs for 11;student:one times 11 for sure,1
teacher:Well youre right now could I double check each number to make sure;student:I dont think so,1
teacher:Harper can you help me out,1
teacher:Any others Harper,1
teacher:If you have a noticing I want you to type it in the chat,1
teacher:Thats a good sentence or what you saying,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Are you saying that the two the five and the 11 they only have one factor pair,1
teacher:River,1
teacher:Diana,1
teacher:Okay so Dianat you say that Prime So by looking at my prime numbers on the board of five and 11 you said they only have one factor,1
teacher:thats true;student:Yes,1
teacher:who can help me out,1
teacher:Now someone who was not in my group because I know that my group talks about this,1
teacher:17,1
teacher:Notes from today;student:I have the notes from the Practice,1
teacher:Okay what about all those words I wrote that I said Hey this is really important for you to write down because its a vocabulary word,1
teacher:What about that part,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:So you guys see my six up here,1
teacher:And then my eight over here,1
teacher:Yeah;student:T I have a question,1
teacher:What is your question,1
teacher:Now if I try to add these lined up like this is that going to give me the right answer Alexander,1
teacher:If I try to add these lined up like this is this gonna give me the answer,1
teacher:Ah Laura,1
teacher:Are you sure,1
teacher:Nice so you use repeated addition to figure out four times eight;student:I got I got 32 and then I put in my answer and just add the zero,1
teacher:And last but not least lets go to lets go to River for this one,1
teacher:Okay lets go to Scarlett,1
teacher:And then if I move my cursor around like if I find the 24 and I know Im trying to do six times four do you guys see how the six and the four are highlighted,1
teacher:And it even tells you the mathematical problem down at the bottom,1
teacher:Are there questions about the multiplication chart,1
teacher:So if you had eight times six youre going to look at the numbers along the very outside down here Im going to move my cursor you guys see these,1
teacher:You mean equals 48;student:I got 480 Because I did eight times six which equaled 80 and then just added zero,1
teacher:Are what correct;student:My question is are my sums correct,1
teacher:Any other questions about where or how Ive gotten where I am,1
teacher:Do you have that written down Missy,1
teacher:The easiest easiest one of all,1
teacher:Valerie,1
teacher:are the numbers in my 624 ever going to go up against each other,1
teacher:So here is place oh Alexander go ahead,1
teacher:You ready,1
teacher:Do you want to see,1
teacher:So is that a factor prayer for five,1
teacher:Oh do we;student:So you already have an arm right,1
teacher:Yes Keily;student:T,1
teacher:Any other questions about what I did,1
teacher:is my head there,1
teacher:Do We have a question,1
teacher:Does that make sense or no,1
teacher:Any other questions of how I got where I am,1
teacher:Alexander,1
teacher:Are you sure;student:s,1
teacher:Yes because this is the little red guy divided by the big green guy right;student:The tangent would be,1
teacher:What did you say,1
teacher:Janessa are you here;student:No Okay,1
teacher:Its half from here to here right,1
teacher:Thats a whole so that would be at  2  pi right,1
teacher:It goes forever up forever down right;student:Just everything,1
teacher:Kind of fun though right;student:Cotangent is only undefined and tangent is zero,1
teacher:Cotangent is the red one right,1
teacher:Does it go up forever down forever,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:If I tell you on the test on Thursday to graph that youre probably not going to jump right to cosecant youre going to grab this buddy right,1
teacher:That is a horizontal compression by a factor of one half right,1
teacher:Normal sines goes here and then here right,1
teacher:Are there any domain restrictions on sine of X,1
teacher:Is this a smooth wave that just keeps going forever on both directions,1
teacher:Everywhere that were at the middle line of this would be a zero over one flipped upside down and turned into a one over zero right,1
teacher:You want to know whats on the test,1
teacher:You want me to show you,1
teacher:Thats a domain restriction right,1
teacher:Memorizing right,1
teacher:What about this,1
teacher:2;student:Two,1
teacher:Its the same absolute value but this one would be a negative tangent right;student:No,1
teacher:Does 8 have the same tangent as 1,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:What about this,1
teacher:Thats 8 as well right;student:Eight,1
teacher:Is the negative of that 8s tangent the same as 1s tangent,1
teacher:If this is 15 it cant be that on a unit circle but if that was 15 this would be 15 right,1
teacher:Would those give you the same fraction except this ones positive and this ones negative,1
teacher:If I made that 1 negative again that would turn it back to a positive right;student:Yes,1
teacher:Is 2s y   x the same as 1s y   x,1
teacher:What about cotangent of  2  theta,1
teacher:Yes because tangent is y   x right;student:Yes,1
teacher:Do you see why you have to be laserguided,1
teacher:When we graphed in class Friday sine and cosecant this blue guy was the graph of sine this red guy was the graph of cosecant right,1
teacher:If I kept going more and more periods would it just be happening every,1
teacher:Tied to the midline;student:Yes because its tied to the hypotenuse which is tied to,1
teacher:The tangent one we did,1
teacher:Guys know your identities okay,1
teacher:Which part are you pointing at,1
teacher:Okay now can you find the slope and the y intercept from the picture,1
teacher:For slope we got to make some stairs right,1
teacher:It was the X of zero right,1
teacher:This one remember we had the alarms going on,1
teacher:Its like a new language that youre learning right,1
teacher:So these are ones that you just want to make sure that theyre not a guess right,1
teacher:taking the test you want to have that feeling now,1
teacher:before the test right,1
teacher:Now can you do it for an equation,1
teacher:Yeah range would mean ys right,1
teacher:Rate yourself,1
teacher:Where you at expert understand most of it understand some of it or dont understand,1
teacher:All right Gabby are there any other factor pairs for four;student:Okay so the factor pairs before are one times four equals four and two times two equals four,1
teacher:Lets go to Janessa,1
teacher:Is this Janessa,1
teacher:Doing them backwards isnt as bad as not doing them at all right,1
teacher:So it has to be flipped for that one because of what column its under right,1
teacher:So what are you going to feel,1
teacher:Three understand most of it two understand some of it or one you are totally lost,1
teacher:Diana,1
teacher:Corbin will you say that sentence again,1
teacher:So guys theres a link to the Pear Deck in the chat if youre just getting Here are several links okay,1
teacher:And remember when I was teaching this to you we talked about kicking the other things out of the party right,1
teacher:So right now we talked about thinking about our thinking right,1
teacher:Wait was I wrong in that last one,1
teacher:No cuz 26 divided by two is 13 hours right,1
teacher:What was it;student:5,1
teacher:Want to see what you know,1
teacher:Go seven p minus two p which is five p I have five p minus four equals 11 now okay,1
teacher:Okay so those of you who made a mistake on that do you feel better about it,1
teacher:Then its something you and I are going to talk about during the help session okay;student:Not really,1
teacher:Remember were just shooting some baskets are throwing some passes right,1
teacher:So rate yourself,1
teacher:Where are you four,1
teacher:expert,1
teacher:And theres no absolutely no risk with doing something wrong right now right,1
teacher:Louisa do you agree disagree or have a question about that one,1
teacher:But is that is that a very different answer from my 534,1
teacher:You dont;student:I dont have that one for my last one,1
teacher:Shall we,1
teacher:Yeah Xavier,1
teacher:So youre proposing half,1
teacher:Were just thinking about what fraction of a size of a piece is it,1
teacher:Is that what Im hearing you say Xavier,1
teacher:You mean write it as a mixed number,1
teacher:Would that be easier for you to wrap your head around;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Lets hear it;student:I have a question,1
teacher:Who would like to tackle that;student:How did you guys got three and onethird,1
teacher:Yes Sabrina,1
teacher:Yeah Adeline,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Lucas did you get your question answered sweetie,1
teacher:Before we do do you have any questions about the review of the problems that we did this morning,1
teacher:Royce,1
teacher:Yeah Allaya,1
teacher:Now over here 24 right,1
teacher:Yeah Adeline;student:Oh okay,1
teacher:So when we look at this do you see how I circled threefourths will fit into one whole one time right;student:How would it why wouldnt it be threefourths,1
teacher:So this piece would have to have one more piece right,1
teacher:So we could say we have this little piece left over here and if we look crew this represents half the size of a group right,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:How do you guys feel about your tape diagrams,1
teacher:So do you think are you thinking one and onethird;student:So you can get onethird and then add that maybe,1
teacher:Yeah Briella,1
teacher:So if we are saying how many times does twothirds fit into onewhole we know that it fits in one time right,1
teacher:Yeah Adeline,1
teacher:Yes Briella,1
teacher:Mathhands anything else you would like me to clarify before we go on,1
teacher:This little part right here,1
teacher:Or the third one;student:Yeah yeah,1
teacher:Is that better,1
teacher:So crew we know that it goes in at least one time right,1
teacher:If we look do you guys see how this piece would take up onethird,1
teacher:Yeah Giselle,1
teacher:Some of you are at a 10,1
teacher:You know what;student:How about half a finger for a half,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:34;student:34,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Yeah Royce,1
teacher:Briar,1
teacher:Okay any last idea proposals,1
teacher:Briar well start with you,1
teacher:Go for it Samson,1
teacher:Uhhuh;student:I think one and 12 too,1
teacher:Yeah;student:You put that 12 left over from that,1
teacher:Yeah Sawyer,1
teacher:Youre going to say one and 38;student:Im actually going to say one and 38,1
teacher:Yeah Samson,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Do you want to keep doing the next one Soren,1
teacher:Yeah Celeste,1
teacher:Any other thoughts,1
teacher:12;student:I think its 12,1
teacher:Yeah Colette,1
teacher:Do you see how four out of the five pieces are there,1
teacher:You understand more,1
teacher:You understand less or stayed the same,1
teacher:whats your vote,1
teacher:Say that again,1
teacher:Lets do Royce,1
teacher:Royce and Sawyer said were going to multiply three times eight because I have three wholes that are broken up into eight right,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Is it the size of the groups or the number of groups,1
teacher:Would you guys like to use a number line or a tape diagram,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:13 is the same as 26 right,1
teacher:Yeah Brennan,1
teacher:Remember our objective is common denominators and models today okay,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Sure  whats up;student:I have a question,1
teacher:Do you see that we dont even have one whole piece there,1
teacher:Brennan did you have another question,1
teacher:Does that sound okay,1
teacher:Yeah Adeline,1
teacher:Keep counting with me,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Yeah lets look at this one you guys ready to tackle this one;student:Okay yeah it does but I was working on number three and then I got 19 over,1
teacher:So one two three,1
teacher:Do you guys have any questions about that one,1
teacher:You mean like how we got to those equivalent fractions;student:Miss I get everything except how we do the nine over 24 and ten,1
teacher:Oh okay then whats your question sorry;student:No I know that,1
teacher:Did I answer your question or not,1
teacher:Not really,1
teacher:Can you ask it and maybe someone else can help me out;student:Not really,1
teacher:Yeah Valarie go for it;student:I can explain it,1
teacher:And your warmup today says use the area models to solve the multiplication problems okay,1
teacher:All right were going to start with Alani,1
teacher:Which problem would you like to start with Alani,1
teacher:Gemma you are next,1
teacher:Okay what is our last step going to be did Nicole leave us,1
teacher:Does that work,1
teacher:Okay so well split this up into 10s and 1s right;student:Well I did 40 well I set up the table and then I did 40x30,1
teacher:Does that make sense so far Harmony,1
teacher:Yeah Hunter,1
teacher:Go for it,1
teacher:Did you hear somebody say that,1
teacher:Id like to go over it with you is that okay,1
teacher:So 1615 Theodore,1
teacher:Yeah Hunter,1
teacher:So do you remember when we did division ladders when we were doing LCM;student:How did you get three and one,1
teacher:Do you guys have anything you want to go over,1
teacher:I have my sticks out so I want you guys to be ready to answer okay,1
teacher:So we should have an answer around 10 okay,1
teacher:Before we do that lets go ahead and add our whole numbers okay;student:Next we are going to I would make it into a mixed fraction,1
teacher:To a mixed number;student:You should probably get that 27 down to a non whats it called,1
teacher:From an improper fraction to a mixed number,1
teacher:Yeah Sammie do you want to take this one,1
teacher:So 5740;student:But its a reverse number so you have to do,1
teacher:Does that help you out Valarie,1
teacher:Yeah Harmony;student:Oh,1
teacher:All right next person is Marley,1
teacher:Marley which one would you like to tackle,1
teacher:Are you there Marley,1
teacher:So were going to draw a picture for these two and were also going to solve them okay,1
teacher:I want you to start and draw it pretty big okay,1
teacher:I want you to draw a big maybe a rectangle here okay,1
teacher:And for me its helpful to divide it down the middle and then to divide each one of the sides okay,1
teacher:So when you are drawing your picture thats what youre doing youre finding a part of a partI know you guys know how to do the algorithm and I know you are very good at it but I also want you to be able to draw a picture to go along with it too okay,1
teacher:Are you guys ready to try the next one,1
teacher:Okay crew how are you doing so far,1
teacher:All right your area models should look like this were going to put 56 on the left hand side and then 7 34 on the top okay,1
teacher:Lucille did you have a question for me,1
teacher:When we divide are we finding the size of the groups or the number of groups,1
teacher:Do you guys have any questions before we move on,1
teacher:Are you guys ready for this,1
teacher:Okay Robert,1
teacher:Fiona,1
teacher:Do you want to count with me up here,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:So that is why Im going to really encourage you to use an area model okay,1
teacher:Okay so now we have our different amounts and so now were going to add all these together okay,1
teacher:All right so we can just leave it at 4 right;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:Landon which one would you like to tackle,1
teacher:Okay Mads to you have yours there sweetie,1
teacher:When you add and subtract it is but when you multiply it is not okay,1
teacher:I can multiply fractions and mixed numbers okay,1
teacher:Yeah Camilla,1
teacher:Okay before we moved on crew what questions do you have,1
teacher:How can I help you,1
teacher:Yeah Adeline,1
teacher:Yes Gemma,1
teacher:Santiago C,1
teacher:Josiah where would you like to go next,1
teacher:Okay what are we going to multiply there;student:The column off to the right,1
teacher:Cool all right Rene youre next which one would you like to do,1
teacher:Cool will you simplify it into a mixed number;student:Or 34 times 54 which is 154,1
teacher:Okay so thats 82 right;student:Well do 4 times 23,1
teacher:And then 2 goes into 8 four times right,1
teacher:My first pick today is Santiago,1
teacher:Did we circle the two numbers whos sum is closest to one half without equaling one half;student:The problem says to circle the two numbers who,1
teacher:I asked you that question earlier today huh,1
teacher:Keep going,1
teacher:For real you guys ready this time,1
teacher:A you are going to go first for 20 seconds,1
teacher:After those 20 seconds who do you think is going to go,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:As your 20 seconds start now,1
teacher:All right Bs it is your turn;student:I add the dots up on this side six and on this side,1
teacher:Switch over to Bs,1
teacher:Did some of you guys Did some of you Bs start talking just a little early,1
teacher:No you guys waited,1
teacher:Corbin lets start with you,1
teacher:Nine total;student:I saw nine,1
teacher:Okay so you saw one group of three times three and then you saw that happened six times;student:I got the same answer as nine for one of my squares and then I multiplied that by six because thats how many there were,1
teacher:Sutton,1
teacher:He saw three times three and did you just recognize it as nine,1
teacher:Im going to go to Corey and then I want Stone to share because Stones is different than what Ive heard so far,1
teacher:Is everybody ready;student:Yep,1
teacher:Corey go for it,1
teacher:You ready,1
teacher:You guys ready,1
teacher:Does that make sense crew,1
teacher:You have three 24ths here that you actually said was equivalent to 18 24ths right,1
teacher:Does that make sense;student:And then the  18,1
teacher:Thats what you plan to do,1
teacher:I want you to keep that in mind because thats what were going to do later today okay,1
teacher:So if we look here  theres one two three four five six seven and eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 so one 24th will fit into  24ths itll fit in 18 times okay,1
teacher:If that makes sense,1
teacher:Hey Beatrice hows it going sweetie,1
teacher:Whitney would you like me to check a problem for you,1
teacher:Crew were going to use your answers that you had this morning were going to look at them this afternoon okay,1
teacher:So crew today our big goal is all about defining equivalent ratios okay,1
teacher:You guys say it,1
teacher:You guys say it again,1
teacher:For example when you roll a die and you look at it do you guys count the number of dots you see,1
teacher:Do you;student:Yeah,1
teacher:You guys ready,1
teacher:Okay so you saw one group that was three by three and then you saw that happen two by three times;student:I counted out three by three on the boxes which is nine and then I saw two by two so I multiplied that which is six and then I just moved,1
teacher:Which would be six right;student:Yes,1
teacher:All right Stone we have not heard something like yours yet,1
teacher:Estella whatd you do,1
teacher:And;student:It was my first time making cookies,1
teacher:Did it work;student:I doubled the cookie powder and I baked cookies,1
teacher:Yeah Willa,1
teacher:Anybody else,1
teacher:Yeah Sutton and then Eloise,1
teacher:And Eloise,1
teacher:Thats a perfect You had to think about just what you needed right;student:Cut it in half because I wasnt going to eat five servings of noodles,1
teacher:Does anybody want to read the instructions on how to make it,1
teacher:Corbin do you want to read it at the top of page eight,1
teacher:Lets go ahead and we are going to create a ratio table to compare the three things that we talked about and were going to scale this up and were going to scale it down okay;student:Yeah make us all some,1
teacher:Thats just to help me and I go back and I look at this recipe Im not like Oh it was this tablespoons,1
teacher:Was this ounces,1
teacher:They have their order for their numbers switched right,1
teacher:Was this pounds,1
teacher:Has anyone recently doubled or tripled or halved a recipe,1
teacher:Did anybody think about it that way,1
teacher:Okay you guys ready to look at it,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:You saw one group of nine and then you just kept adding groups of nine,1
teacher:Is that right,1
teacher:That would be 54 right,1
teacher:You guys ready,1
teacher:On your marks get set go,1
teacher:This time we are going to start with Bs,1
teacher:Im going to have you guys start with your partner;student:Id say 30 but,1
teacher:So we can actually switch these around and say we have 18 24ths which is what three fourths is right,1
teacher:I will let you know when its time to switch okay,1
teacher:Okay Bs you may get started,1
teacher:As it is your turn;student:Thatd be 50,1
teacher:Can I see your eyes;student:Yep,1
teacher:Tate lets start with you,1
teacher:Eloise go for it,1
teacher:Did you do six times eight and then divide by two;student:I didnt see it as six or seven I saw it as six and eight so I just split eight and six in half to make it easier to multiply,1
teacher:Did you do three by four,1
teacher:Were going to start with Bs,1
teacher:Brighton were going to start with you,1
teacher:Did you guys write yours with a common denominator,1
teacher:To start off itll be helpful to draw a number line thats  in fourths so zero one two and I want two and three fourths and then I circle  one fourth here okay,1
teacher:Do you see here like for this one how we started by when we did times three,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:One block if you have nine blocks and each of them takes one block that would be nine pizzas right,1
teacher:Mathland hows it going,1
teacher:Do you guys have any questions,1
teacher:Did you guys have any questions as youre working,1
teacher:Yeah Sterling,1
teacher:Yes Corrine,1
teacher:Whitney why dont we start with you,1
teacher:Whitney do you want to talk about one or two or three,1
teacher:So if we have our eight holes here one two three four five six seven eight okay,1
teacher:Yeah Raul keep going,1
teacher:Well if this is telling me eight divided into groups that are the size of two well heres one one group of two right,1
teacher:At the very top of your page we can do along the side if we want to okay,1
teacher:Were going to add one more thing to this because theres two ways I want you to be able to do it okay,1
teacher:Yeah Sterling,1
teacher:Do you guys know what a concession stand is,1
teacher:If we draw our picture over here Yeah,1
teacher:Whats up Deborah,1
teacher:This is one group of 34 okay,1
teacher:Its not 14 okay,1
teacher:Lets talk about the part thats left over okay,1
teacher:Yeah Chance,1
teacher:Sound good,1
teacher:Our second problem Yeah,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Youre going to have three pizzas that you can make from each piece right,1
teacher:Mathland what questions do you guys have,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Sure;student:I have a question,1
teacher:Whats up,1
teacher:Yeah Sweetie;student:T,1
teacher:Does that makes sense,1
teacher:Sure;student:I have another question,1
teacher:Yeah;student:Wait Im a little bit confused,1
teacher:At sporting events;student:Yeah,1
teacher:So have you guys ever been  McDonalds and how they sell the very popular quarter pounder,1
teacher:That is also their thing right;student:But I thought it was a Big Mac,1
teacher:Does that make sense crew,1
teacher:Raul are you guys ready;student:seven eight,1
teacher:Make sure that you are drawing a picture to represent that too okay Barbara,1
teacher:Are you guys ready,1
teacher:hows it going,1
teacher:So here is your number line and we have a zero okay,1
teacher:Theres three okay,1
teacher:Can you see that okay,1
teacher:And then divide all of these up into fourths and see how many times one fourth will fit into two and three fourths okay,1
teacher:Hey Astrid Im ready for you sweetie;student:Wasnt,1
teacher:And you;student:common denominator,1
teacher:Whitney did you need help sweetie,1
teacher:Right now,1
teacher:Have you asked your group,1
teacher:So Whitney is correct at 11 so Whitney I want you to turn your camera on and help your group how you got 11 okay,1
teacher:And then were going to do you three are on the edge are partners okay,1
teacher:One two three okay were going to do Royal and Rocky you guys are going to be partners okay,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Im going to make sure everybody on your team is on the same page okay,1
teacher:And then you guys are going to get to do a couple in some groups today okay,1
teacher:So here were just going to reiterate what were going to do okay,1
teacher:So we want to know how many one eighths will fit into seven eighths okay,1
teacher:Well get to our answer in just a minute but thats our number sentence thats what were trying to solve okay,1
teacher:Do guys want to do a number line or do you want to do a tape diagram,1
teacher:Which one would you like to do,1
teacher:Number line,1
teacher:what,1
teacher:Hello Amalia whats up,1
teacher:Sure;student:I have a question,1
teacher:Dos that make sense,1
teacher:Are you there Raul,1
teacher:So we know were going to get at least three patties out of this but we have some left over okay,1
teacher:So we have one eighth left over okay,1
teacher:Does anyone have questions about what our remainder,1
teacher:Those of you in the room you have your paper here I want you to see that there are stop signs here when you get to a stop sign you need to stop and then it says Call a teaCher over to check your work okay,1
teacher:So we have one theres one patty one eighth thats going to be a smaller burger okay,1
teacher:Are you there Julia,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Okay because four plus nine is 13 and then remember we dont add our denominators right,1
teacher:23,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Sam,1
teacher:So can we say another 12 times 10,1
teacher:Because you have six leftover right,1
teacher:You did long division;student:I divided by 12 so,1
teacher:Well we can check it with long division right,1
teacher:They didnt want to have one thats super expensive right;student:They are small numbers,1
teacher:So you would like it better if the second number was as a multiple right,1
teacher:That would make it much easier to compute;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:Waylon I saw your hand up,1
teacher:Zane,1
teacher:They are giving you a deal,1
teacher:Yeah Brian,1
teacher:Let me just catch up with you there okay,1
teacher:You think 20 is the answer;student:I think its 20,1
teacher:Is there somebody who could reiterate Aysas strategy;student:And then eight plus two is obviously 10 and then I got the same answer,1
teacher:Were you kind of using that distributive property thing when you were thinking about 20 times 12 and five times 12,1
teacher:When you think about it let me know okay,1
teacher:Do you mean in C;student:Are the teaspoons koolaid and the cups are water,1
teacher:We know that A and B are the same right,1
teacher:So it just got doubled right,1
teacher:Huh,1
teacher:But you know what,1
teacher:Then that would be five times as much right,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Angelina how can I help you sweetie,1
teacher:Does that make sense so far,1
teacher:Angelina I am so sorry but Ill finish this afternoon okay,1
teacher:Our goal for today,1
teacher:Can you guys do this,1
teacher:Carter how can I help you,1
teacher:Were going to discuss them okay,1
teacher:Do you want to keep that one there for now;student:I personally think its 20 and I think 25s,1
teacher:Are you thinking maybe its in the ballpark close,1
teacher:Annabel can you reiterate it,1
teacher:Okay so pick up this and divide by two right;student:And half of it is 2,1
teacher:Okay and then Annabel and then what did he do next;student:I think so,1
teacher:Is that what you said you did,1
teacher:Divided by four right,1
teacher:Do you want to go this one,1
teacher:Yeah Quintin,1
teacher:Do you guys know what a treadmill is,1
teacher:The 30;student:30 miles 30 feet,1
teacher:Are youre asking what the 30 represents,1
teacher:Can you see it there;student:So their distance,1
teacher:Yes;student:I noticed another one,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:They are different right,1
teacher:So are they running,1
teacher:Mai;student:I though that,1
teacher:Winnie;student:No Winnie,1
teacher:So did somebody say how did you get that;student:Theyre going the same distance theyre on the same incline and theyre at the same level and theyre at the same distance but Mai ran it faster which means shes running or walking faster which means shes getting a better workout than Winnie whos jogging,1
teacher:What question would you like to ask me,1
teacher:Are you there Neil,1
teacher:Not much better but a little bit right,1
teacher:Yeah Quintin,1
teacher:You do;student:I have a different strategy,1
teacher:Do you guys remember this,1
teacher:Can we do that strategy,1
teacher:When you guys come back this afternoon were going to keep doing some unit rate practice okay,1
teacher:Especially get crafty with our ratio tables okay,1
teacher:So we can start with eight tricks is to 24 treats right,1
teacher:Micah lets do it,1
teacher:Did Marvin get his typed in,1
teacher:Well even in the short term right,1
teacher:Did anybody tackle the hamster problem,1
teacher:You did;student:Sure,1
teacher:For the hamster;student:It should be 14 to four,1
teacher:14 every 14 tricks they would get four,1
teacher:Oh its 55,1
teacher:The unit rate and ratio tables,1
teacher:Yeah Peter,1
teacher:So the dog has to work harder right,1
teacher:Than Mai;student:So thats a decent amount less than Mai,1
teacher:Who would want mixture B,1
teacher:Were going to assume its all the same flavor okay,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Should we check it out,1
teacher:Two right,1
teacher:Whats the question,1
teacher:Charlie,1
teacher:How about number lines,1
teacher:Now earlier today we had equivalent ratios when we were drawing our diagrams right,1
teacher:Thats even what I drew isnt it,1
teacher:If we wanted to we could double it again okay,1
teacher:I can also say that 40 yerts will have 240 people right,1
teacher:Oh I didnt write 40 yerts,1
teacher:Do you want me to,1
teacher:Charlie you bring up a good point right,1
teacher:Do you guys feel good about scaling up using multiplication so far,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:What are you math facts you wrote down real fast;student:Just because 16 divided by 4 is 4,1
teacher:Can you give me a thumbs up if you feel good about that,1
teacher:You feel good about that,1
teacher:and  keep your cameras on please I want to be able see you,1
teacher:Whats your question sweetie,1
teacher:Do you want to maybe try 110 and 38,1
teacher:Do you guys have any questions about your matching cards,1
teacher:Can you scale it up to something else,1
teacher:So 3 circles right,1
teacher:Do you see 6 and 2 anywhere,1
teacher:How can I help you,1
teacher:Yes sweetie;student:Misses Konz,1
teacher:So you would figure out how many times six would go into a 150;student:I would like narrow it down in between those numbers,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Will you help with long division in just a little bit;student:And I remembered how to do it,1
teacher:Okay go for it,1
teacher:So were going to bring down our zero okay;student:Then you subtract those and you get three,1
teacher:Oh my gosh  turn those cameras on,1
teacher:Please do that in 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 and keep them on please,1
teacher:How do you guys feel about 16 divided by 4,1
teacher:Mathland turn your cameras on please,1
teacher:Do you guys feel good about scaling down with division,1
teacher:Hugh,1
teacher:It is your job to finish this and then upload a page to Google Classroom does that make sense,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:And then a triple would be that you triple it and you have triple as much right,1
teacher:Do you guys remember these manipulatives from elementary school,1
teacher:What Jude,1
teacher:Jericho whats up,1
teacher:Yeah go ahead;student:Do you want me to answer,1
teacher:Im going to have Jericho take this one,1
teacher:Do you want to take that one on,1
teacher:Yes Adeline,1
teacher:In my picture I notice six hexagons and two trapezoids right,1
teacher:Let me start with Alani,1
teacher:And then you halved the rest of these or the number of tiles right,1
teacher:So our number of trapezoids when we double that right,1
teacher:But does that change which drink you would like to have then,1
teacher:Were reRamona close right,1
teacher:Hank,1
teacher:Who has an idea for what we could do you guys see how Im marking this up to what Im doing,1
teacher:Mathland cameras on please,1
teacher:Yeah well do some more practice ones does that sound all right;student:I feel good about it I just kind of am confused on how you get the final answer the bottom one and the top one,1
teacher:Ill show you one more example Hugh and then well practice with them okay,1
teacher:Now one other thing we can do is we can add columns okay,1
teacher:Do you have any questions so far,1
teacher:Do you want of about how we use them and why we use them,1
teacher:So Im going to do another one for you okay;student:Okay that makes sense,1
teacher:Notice how I multiplied by 10 and like I said Im just showing you a lot of different ways you can use your ratio table so then what I can do is divide by two Im going to divide both of these by two because they are both divisible by two right,1
teacher:Can you raise your hand if you would want mixture A,1
teacher:Notice how everything I do all of my steps are listed here for me,1
teacher:But on the bottom here do two times 20,1
teacher:Lets see yours real fast does yours look different than mine,1
teacher:Like this;student:Would this be an adults,1
teacher:So we want to get the number of students we want to get this to 172 right,1
teacher:So right now I know that in this situation Im going to need 35 adults I could go down right,1
teacher:We knew we needed 35 chaperones right,1
teacher:And then it would just be kind of like out there right;student:Well you just do half of,1
teacher:How are you feeling about that so far,1
teacher:Kind of like an equivalent ratio;student:Im not sure but maybe if you have different,1
teacher:Yeah go for it Elliana;student:Can I try it,1
teacher:Were you listening to Dixie,1
teacher:You feel like weve answered our question,1
teacher:Crew is there anything I can answer for you or clarify for you,1
teacher:You guys ready to keep rocking and rolling,1
teacher:Those of you in MathLand are you clear whats happening,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Clarissa,1
teacher:Jessica,1
teacher:And will that get us from 7 to 28;student:I multiplied by 4,1
teacher:Lets do that and then well compare your answer to Ainsleys,1
teacher:Does that sound doable,1
teacher:Ainsley is that what you got for your strategy,1
teacher:Hey are you ready to do another one,1
teacher:Can you guys show me your thumb over here where youre at,1
teacher:You may go to your breakout room once you have the information you need okay,1
teacher:Or did they just say its a big sale,1
teacher:Have we answered our question yet crew,1
teacher:Brendan,1
teacher:That was your strategy;student:That was my strategy,1
teacher:You did;student:Yes,1
teacher:Okay go for it;student:Yes,1
teacher:Who else,1
teacher:Carson,1
teacher:If we take one whole and we divide it into five equal pieces it would be 2 right,1
teacher:Yeah Alison,1
teacher:So Frankie can I ask you a followup question,1
teacher:Yeah River,1
teacher:Okay Joanna you are first,1
teacher:I just want to see if theres any more questions before we move on,1
teacher:And then Catalina,1
teacher:Blaze Im going to go back to you sweetie,1
teacher:Yeah Carson,1
teacher:So Clarissa when you see this problem is this a parts to part problem,1
teacher:Or is this a part to part to whole problem,1
teacher:Okay Eileen,1
teacher:Now did you know that 17 x five was 85;student:Do 17 x 5,1
teacher:Are we looking at eights,1
teacher:Are those fourths;student:The third one,1
teacher:Can you hear me,1
teacher:So you started with how can you finish your sentence for how;student:I just dont really understand that,1
teacher:Do we have the two smallest numbers to be able to find the sum that is closest to zero here,1
teacher:Now starting off are there any cards we can eliminate do you think,1
teacher:Is there anything we can eliminate from the very beginning,1
teacher:Sammie is there anything you feel like we could eliminate,1
teacher:Okay anything else we can eliminate Rose,1
teacher:For the same reason good shout listening to Sammie;student:For the same reason,1
teacher:Anything else we can eliminate,1
teacher:Arriana do you see anything else we can eliminate because it already exceeds what were looking for,1
teacher:Yeah Carter whats up,1
teacher:Mack since I have you are there any other cards we can eliminate that are more than one half,1
teacher:Do you want to tackle that one,1
teacher:So a big thing that we have to remember when we add fractions is they have to have a common denominator okay,1
teacher:Callie,1
teacher:So right now do you guys see how these do not have a common denominator,1
teacher:Valarie your brain is just going going whats up,1
teacher:Theodore do you want to go for it,1
teacher:Who would like to put those two strategies that we heard together,1
teacher:So youre looking for a small numerator does that tell you that you have a smaller fraction,1
teacher:Julia do you want to tackle this one,1
teacher:Robert do you want to take that one,1
teacher:Do you agree disagree or have a question,1
teacher:Hey Baker are you there sweetie,1
teacher:Leslie you have the next one the blue one for B,1
teacher:So its 50 and then one more fourth right,1
teacher:Howd we do,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions about how we got 24 there,1
teacher:Christie do you want to do 25 50 or 75,1
teacher:Yeah Alfie,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:And if we divide by four that would be 25 right,1
teacher:Yeah and then you take that number and you have one fourth two fourths three fourths right;student:And then you can multiply it by three,1
teacher:Does that make sense Nadia,1
teacher:Kaysen Im not sure what youre pasting into the answer boxes but it doesnt look like what were up to right now okay,1
teacher:Does that make sense what its asking you,1
teacher:Are you there Magnus,1
teacher:Yeah whats up Bronwyn;student:Im a little confused,1
teacher:Yes Alison,1
teacher:Im going to give you guys did three minutes feel like too much time or not enough time,1
teacher:I think her computer might still be a little  Are you there sweetie,1
teacher:And tell me which one you can tell me you think one of them is false or you can ask questions okay,1
teacher:Emmie why do you want to go first here,1
teacher:Are you there,1
teacher:Emmie,1
teacher:So you think number two is false,1
teacher:You were saying those are not equal,1
teacher:Can you help me,1
teacher:Does anybody look at this and say onefifth of 20,1
teacher:Or ask a question,1
teacher:So what is the question you would like to ask,1
teacher:Does that make sense how I got that part,1
teacher:Yeah;student:45 fifths,1
teacher:So now both sides of your equation equal nine right,1
teacher:What followup questions do you have Giana,1
teacher:What would you like to tackle,1
teacher:You may choose to identify the statements that are false or you can ask a question okay,1
teacher:This is the commutative property right,1
teacher:So youre kind of torn between both of them;student:So Im,1
teacher:If you think Terrances is more orangy raise your hands,1
teacher:Did they pay the same rate,1
teacher:So youll notice 141 for nine tickets is more right,1
teacher:Do you guys have any questions before we move on,1
teacher:Does somebody want to read this recipe for sparkling orange juice,1
teacher:You guys ready to look at these a little bit,1
teacher:So you think Terrances is going to be stronger;student:I was just going to say five squares but I also feel like Terrances will have a stronger taste because its a one difference but I feel like it would probably be more of a,1
teacher:Can I show you guys a way to compare these,1
teacher:And her ratio is three to four right,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Can I help you out a little bit;student:I dont know,1
teacher:Is that what you were going to say,1
teacher:Yeah Dixie,1
teacher:You think its easier to get from five to one and one third;student:Probably the soda water,1
teacher:If you think its Cassidy raise your hands,1
teacher:If you think the Cassidys is more orangy raise your hands,1
teacher:Are you switching your votes;student:I think its Cassidy,1
teacher:So in both of these situations were saying were finding onetwelfth of 486 right,1
teacher:And then if I think about 141 do you remember our trick for three,1
teacher:So what percent  Go for it Campbell,1
teacher:Yes Alexa;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Pardon me,1
teacher:Carson you were actually my next person,1
teacher:River,1
teacher:Yeah Annabelle;student:Wait I kind of forgot what I was going to say,1
teacher:River,1
teacher:Frankie you are up,1
teacher:Whatd you say;student:100,1
teacher:Yeah Blaze,1
teacher:What;student:Whats whiteout,1
teacher:Do you guys have any questions on how to use long division,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Can you hang onto that question for just a little bit;student:Its not really about the money what if there was a remainder,1

teacher:Valentina you want to weigh in on this,2
teacher:Jacob help her out,2
teacher:Does everybody agree;student:Yes,2

teacher:Anybody want to help him,2
teacher:So do you all agree;student:How much of the pizza did you eat,2
teacher:Does somebody have something to add to that,2

teacher:Did everyone put 96;student:I put 96,2
teacher:900000 do you agree;student:I got 900000,2
teacher:A thousandths do we agree;student:Thousandths,2
teacher:So tell me more,2
teacher:So that clearly shows that what they ate was  did you agree with the number sentence that they used,2
teacher:Do you like this picture;student:I noticed that,2
teacher:Why did she have to put that one up there,2
teacher:Why did she have to do that,2
teacher:So can anybody tell why did she have to do this,2

teacher:Fractionwise;student:Yes,2
teacher:In your explanation did you use the word columns and rows;student:Yes,2
teacher:Do we agree that he used the correct vocabulary,2
teacher:Okay do we agree that that is a number story;student:I said Jimmy Jonathon has seven feet of fence one way and eight on the other how much area of fencing does he have in total,2

teacher:Do you need to ask for help in your group,2
teacher:Okay is that a number story yes or no;student:What we said was John went to the store and bought seven bananas and each banana cost 8 then he went to the checkout and got a grand total of 56,2
teacher:Number story,2
teacher:Is that a number sentence yes or no,2
teacher:Break it into columns and rows,2
teacher:Okay so three fourths times one half is leS than three fourths do we agree with that,2
teacher:Do we agree with that or disagree;student:So it would be nine over twelve,2
teacher:What part did he get right;student:Well you got the first part right but then you,2
teacher:so help explain where Michaels going who can add to that,2
teacher:Go ahead and phone a friend please,2
teacher:Need to phone a friend,2
teacher:You are both going to make sure that your papers are the same okay,2
teacher:X and Y coordinates;student:I used more  horizontally,2

teacher:Agreed,2
teacher:Make sure your neighbors match,2
teacher:Who did not agree who did not have this part,2
teacher:So we agree that fivetenths is less than forty nine hundredths,2
teacher:Did you guys get that,2
teacher:Come here Connor so you can help,2
teacher:So do you see that theyre no different,2
teacher:She made this the numerator and denominator didnt she,2
teacher:So what she did is she took divide it by 5 right,2
teacher:So does it work out the same way Zachs does,2
teacher:Agree or disagree,2
teacher:Alyssa do you have something you would like to add,2
teacher:If you believe that that is the right way to do it give me a thumbs up,2
teacher:Do you agree with that;student:Then you do the 3  line,2
teacher:How come,2
teacher:Do you agree with that,2
teacher:Mason did his with,2
teacher:Blake did his by,2

teacher:If you believe there is another way to do that and you would like to explain that to the class please put your hand up in the air if you have a different strategy you use,2
teacher:Phone a friend,2
teacher:Morgan can you build off that please;student:Um me and my partner talked about the tick marks were there because they were helping us place the lines so we know where to plot the lines so we can have our fractions,2
teacher:Okay whats our misconception Zach;student:What,2
teacher:Thumbs up,2
teacher:If you disagree give me a thumbs up,2
teacher:Do you agree with this one fourth two fourths,2
teacher:Do you all agree or did you get different answers,2
teacher:Did all five of you agree,2
teacher:If you do not have the same answers be seated,2
teacher:Do you all have the same answers stay standing,2
teacher:Well Zach what do you want to add;student:Um maybe even squares,2
teacher:If you do not be seated,2
teacher:The four of you standing get together compare answers,2
teacher:Do we agree with that,2

teacher:Kate do you agree or disagree with that,2
teacher:What did he do,2
teacher:Agreed;student:inaudible,2
teacher:Yeah you do;student:Yeah,2
teacher:you need to phone a friend;student:Nevermind,2
teacher:Raise your hand if you counted by twos,2
teacher:So you did the same as Diego,2
teacher:So did somebody do it another way,2
teacher:James did you do it another way;student:Yeah,2
teacher:Did anybody else decompose a different way;student:What I did was I did onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth five times and I got fivesixths,2
teacher:No did you get a different answer;student:What I think,2
teacher:Raise your hand if you got 158  cups of water,2
teacher:Counted by tens,2
teacher:Raise your hand if you got five cups of water,2
teacher:Julia what do you think,2
teacher:Anybody get a different answer,2
teacher:Did anybody get something that was way  different;student:Yeah,2
teacher:Do you agree with Diegos drawing here,2
teacher:Julia what do you think,2
teacher:Miguel what do you think,2
teacher:What do  you think about them,2
teacher:Anybody have a different answer,2
teacher:Yeah can you,2
teacher:Everybody got 20,2
teacher:Up if we agree down if we disagree,2
teacher:Okay if you all agree give me a thumbs up;student:Agree,2
teacher:Blake do you agree or disagree with her,2
teacher:Who can help me help her understand why she drew that line there,2
teacher:Anybody do something different,2
teacher:Give me a thumbs up,2
teacher:Do you agree with what William is saying,2
teacher:So go ahead and explain why you disagree with Emily,2
teacher:Agree or disagree;student:I got one million,2
teacher:William explain to me why you disagree with Emily,2
teacher:Or sorry Katie tell me what your partner said,2
teacher:Hannah tell me what your partner said,2
teacher:Jake share the response William gave,2
teacher:Okay so Christian do you see how he used the place value chart;student:How come 11 is so theres nine zeros for 1000000000 so youre going to attach two zeros to get to 100000000000,2
teacher:Help him out Josh,2
teacher:I want you to listen very carefully once you phone that friend to their response;student:Yeah,2
teacher:Do you need to phone a friend;student:Its the pattern that helps you write it is,2
teacher:If you disagree with that show me by giving me a thumbs down;student:because times four is 20 and  to do it again but then its,2
teacher:Agrred thumbs up;student:and then one fifth,2
teacher:Did She showed us how she broke it apart;student:Yeah,2
teacher:Did you have the same thing they have,2
teacher:Should she add something to that,2
teacher:So their whole book is off isnt it;student:No,2
teacher:So their grid is off isnt it,2
teacher:No different than our other friends was it,2
teacher:Do we agree that they used the word coordinate,2
teacher:What do you think Matt;student:No,2
teacher:So is your answer similar to his or not;student:No,2
teacher:Do we agree that thats a great response for number one;student:In my rule it would be originally how you could double both the X and Y coordinates and I added This makes the book bigger in width and length making the book become 8 in width and 10 in length,2
teacher:How did you match up,2
teacher:Anybody else want to add anything to it,2
teacher:Add to what do you think we should add to it Anna,2
teacher:So add to agree,2
teacher:Do we agree with what Brogan said or do you think we need to add to it,2
teacher:Do we all agree with these,2
teacher:Jonathan do you agree or disagree,2
teacher:Did you agree on everybody had the same,2
teacher:Okay so you both have the same;student:We both have the same,2
teacher:All of you agreed on the ones that tripled it,2
teacher:What does she need to add do you think,2
teacher:Did he tell me the mathematical process he used;student:And then my width was 4 so I multiplied it by 4 to get 16,2
teacher:Anyone want to add to that,2
teacher:If you disagree with that give me a thumbs down,2
teacher:If you agree with that give me a thumbs up;student:It was over 5 so I need to round it up and turn it into a 90,2
teacher:Mason you want to add to that,2
teacher:Would you like to look at one anothers,2
teacher:Now do not know if hes right or youre right do you,2
teacher:We agree with that,2
teacher:Anything,2
teacher:Phone a friend please;student:How problem one is different from problem two was that on problem one they had common denominators other numbers but in problem two Oh wait,2
teacher:Do you agree or disagree with what she just said;student:So she did 10 plus one equals 11 when it should have been three plus one,2
teacher:So did your answers agree,2
teacher:And did your answers agree;student:We just checked answers,2
teacher:12 and 84 hundredths agree;student:12 and 84 hundredths,2
teacher:Agree or disagree;student:84 and threetenths,2
teacher:Agree or disagree;student:I got four and ninetenths,2
teacher:Did he give me what he multiplied together and what the sum was;student:Yes,2
teacher:So does that make sense what Julia did,2
teacher:And you agree;student:Yeah,2
teacher:Can you two take a minute to explain to both of them what they did wrong,2
teacher:Explain to your partner what he did wrong,2
teacher:So Eric what was one question someone in your group asked that you had not thought of,2
teacher:Agree or disagree;student:I said one and one half because four thirds is already one whole and a little bit less than a half plus one tenth isnt that much,2
teacher:agree or disagree;student:Yeah,2
teacher:Help him understand,2
teacher:Do you agree;student:And then we got three fourths,2
teacher:Zach what do you think;student:Yeah,2
teacher:Oh you disagreeGo ahead John what do you disagree with,2
teacher:Zach what is something in your group that was talked about that you did not have,2
teacher:If you agree with that what do we need to add,2
teacher:Do we agree,2
teacher:Do you want phone a friend;student:It has to be,2
teacher:Im gonna ask Amy to explain that to you because she just went through it with me,2
teacher:Okay Michael would you come meet with cannon please just to verify pages,2
teacher:Elijah can I get you to come coach Brogan,2
teacher:one and 8 thirds agree;student:One and 83rds,2
teacher:Okay agree;student:And I got 2 and 53rds,2
teacher:Friends standing you are going to agree or disagree or add to,2
teacher:Luke what is something your partner said that you did not,2
teacher:What was something your group said that you did not,2
teacher:And Rob what was something your group talked about,2
teacher:If you and your partner have the exact same sailboat go down and kneel down,2
teacher:Disagree,2
teacher:Agree;student:I think it would be because theres already a one and so threeeighths is close to a half and twothirds is also close to a half so a half plus a half would be a whole,2
teacher:How can we help his understanding change,2
teacher:Explain to him why you said zero why his thinking  What is his thinking,2
teacher:Zach would you please,2
teacher:Who can help Michael clarify his thinking,2
teacher:Oh you agree;student:No we got 23,2
teacher:Thumbs up if we agree,2
teacher:If you agree with that give me a thumbs up,2
teacher:Zach would you like to add to that,2
teacher:Do we agree for the least,2
teacher:really agree with that explanation;student:And if youre filling out the grid for the 240 8000s you would only put two tenths,2
teacher:3400 is greater than if you agree with that give me a thumbs up;student:zero three four hundred,2
teacher:Do we agree or disagree with 80 plus nine,2
teacher:Our friends need help over there Eli and Ethan can you go help them,2
teacher:Does one model stand out that it might need some clarification,2
teacher:Did anybody have something similar or different;student:The flowers,2
teacher:Everybody agree so far,2
teacher:Who believes they understand that the best,2
teacher:Its pretty perfect huh,2
teacher:So his coordinates he did not follow his rule did he;student:Yes,2
teacher:Look at what he did here and did he do it all the way down;student:Yes,2
teacher:He multiplied that Y coordinate by six didnt he;student:He said you will only multiply the X coordinate but he did the Y coordinate,2
teacher:Jenn tell me what he did,2
teacher:What did he do in the second one,2
teacher:What did he do Kayla,2
teacher:What do you think,2
teacher:How can it have worked,2
teacher:Yes Stella would you like to add something to that,2
teacher:Did you agree with or disagree with that they used the same coordinates,2
teacher:Did you agree with they just moved it and they did a different size,2
teacher:Franc what did you disagree with what I said,2
teacher:If you disagree with something I said put your thumb off to the side,2
teacher:If you disagree with everything that I said raise your hand,2
teacher:both,2
teacher:Is it in your opinion right or wrong and why and could it be,2
teacher:Why did you disagree,2
teacher:What do you notice about this work,2
teacher:Im not sure hes got a book here doesnt he,2
teacher:Did he double;student:It worked because he doubled the X coordinates and Y coordinates,2
teacher:Asher are you agreeing with the sum or the total being 06 and 007,2
teacher:Would you say because there werent any whole grids shaded;student:Maybe you could put zero in front of the decimal so that we know so that its easier to understand,2
teacher:Questions comments feedback;student:Then what I did was 02  047 to get 067,2
teacher:Or perhaps like units;student:Next time can you label how Like next to the blue you could label 0020,2
teacher:Okay Missy will take a question comment or feedback;student:I did 0020 which was blue 10 cones I think and I had four of the red cones and seven cubes so I thought when I added them together and I got 067 in total,2
teacher:All right my friends in a gallery walk your goal is to go around and look at how other kids solved and was your thinking similar or different,2
teacher:Okay questions comments feedback on how they got their estimate and I want you to think about words like reasonable and efficient;student:Yes,2
teacher:MIssy explain to me why his book worked,2
teacher:Now coach,2
teacher:Specifically Jared said we looked at;student:Yes,2
teacher:Ricky what did you say the second he said that;student:No,2
teacher:This wasnt a full square up here was it;student:Yes it was only half a square,2
teacher:As soon as he said we dont have a 35 what should you have said,2
teacher:What should you have done when he said theres no 35;student:He didnt say that he said that theres no 35 so,2
teacher:Should you have listened to what Ricky was saying in the first place when he said you dont have enough;student:No,2
teacher:Im going to ask you to phone a friend in your group to help you continue explaining;student:Second guesses,2
teacher:Okay class do you have any questions comments or feedback for your team up here;student:34 48 78 and 34,2
teacher:Questions comments and feedback,2
teacher:You have to be able to explain why,2
teacher:They followed the rule;student:No,2
teacher:We dont have room to write that 24 times you agree,2
teacher:Disagree,2
teacher:Anybody else agree;student:Yes,2
teacher:Do you agree,2
teacher:What do you think,2
teacher:Did you guys have something similar;student:This  represent how many flowers are there,2
teacher:in thinking we should have that zero on the end;student:Yes,2
teacher:Georgia can you add to that please,2
teacher:Could you see how they were confused;student:We respectfully disagree with you,2
teacher:How else did you figure it out;student:5 and,2
teacher:Do you agree,2
teacher:How do we feel about Elis choices here,2
teacher:What did he do to add them,2
teacher:Raise your hand if you got the same answer;student:He did really good,2
teacher:How did he do,2
teacher:How do we feel about that;student:Yes,2
teacher:Shes saying Sorry Emanuel its not 50 because,2
teacher:In your groups take a minute to look at it and I want you to analyze what this person did and I want you to talk about is this right or is it wrong,2
teacher:Angela can you determine at this point exactly where he went wrong,2
teacher:Could I get you to work with my two friends right over here to make sure that they understand this concept,2
teacher:Did they successfully enlarge it,2
teacher:Did you two friends agree,2
teacher:Do you agree with him,2
teacher:Do you believe that,2
teacher:Is it one and four Sarah,2
teacher:Do you agree with that,2
teacher:Coach him through,2
teacher:Is it when he connected his next plot,2
teacher:Coach him through,2
teacher:Hudson can you add to Carsons thinking;student:Well because the first because the numbers rule between two coordinates,2
teacher:They were not the same were they;student:Yes,2
teacher:Did we see a variety of different algorithms up there,2
teacher:Okay give me that thumbs up if you agree with Clays answer;student:I proved it because 11 can go into three three times so thats the whole number and the remainder of two so I knew that the answer was three and two thirds,2
teacher:What mistake did your partner make;student:I think so,2
teacher:Is your partner ready to make a mistake,2
teacher:Who can help;student:When you have to double to take off the zero do we keep zero or we stick to a one,2
teacher:They both used the information that was given and interpreted it differently didnt they,2
teacher:What do you think their mistake was Viviana,2
teacher:What do you guys thinking about what Christoph just said;student:Well from the 02 wouldnt it be 20 instead of two,2
teacher:What needs to be lined up in this problem;student:Then in the hundredths place you can put a zero behind the two,2
teacher:Tell me think about that rule he gave,2
teacher:I want you to think about what Franc just said and tell me if that would work and what steps you would have to take,2
teacher:Alexander I think you want to add something to it;student:It will be,2
teacher:Who got two and seventwelfths over there,2
teacher:Clay show them what you did with your drawing and show them why its different than what they did,2
teacher:Why are you disagreeing with that,2
teacher:What did you and Joshua agree on for the estimation for number three;student:Because me and Joshua agreed on both of them but then Stan didnt get it,2
teacher:What was his rule,2
teacher:If your table group did not table leader give me a thumbs down if your table group did not;student:I got Never mind,2
teacher:How many of you made it 113,2
teacher:Who did not make it 43,2
teacher:How many then is she adding to that 13,2
teacher:Franc how much of a little bit did she take;student:Yes,2
teacher:Thumbs up if you agree thumbs down if you dont,2
teacher:If your group agreed 100 before having a conversion stand up if your answers were the exact same,2
teacher:You have to come to a consensus,2
teacher:Okay did you agree on your estimation,2
teacher:You guys have to come to a consensus,2
teacher:Does that work;student:If you divide the in by a fifth then you can get an out,2
teacher:Would you like to add something to that;student:When you multiply it by two or divide,2
teacher:Everybody understand the strategy that they used;student:Two,2
teacher:Anyone else want to add to that,2
teacher:Agree or disagree;student:and then you have 12 of 2 is one so you can split the leftover 112,2
teacher:Do you see how he did that,2
teacher:Okay so now Judy is going to explain why he disagrees;student:find the common denominator and it gives you 1218 I got 58,2
teacher:Joseph and Rebecca do you understand that,2
teacher:Okay coach tell him what he needed to do show him what he needed to do,2
teacher:Tell me how it works with 10 and three fifths,2
teacher:Do you understand how he did that,2
teacher:What was her misconception;student:For the first one I did 12 5 and got 225,2
teacher:Do we agree;student:12 34 and then I did four 4x28,2
teacher:If it s Dianas way I want a five,2
teacher:If its Franc Clay and Tera I want you to do a fist,2
teacher:Which is the easiest way to do this the way that you heard from Franc Clay Tera or Dianas way,2
teacher:You want to add to something Clay,2
teacher:Im going to go to Diana first and Tera Im going to ask you to add to Diana if you can,2
teacher:Help,2
teacher:Do you see a little something he could do that would fix this;student:Add the tenths the 02 and not the hundredths but,2
teacher:Is there anyone that thought another one was easiest,2
teacher:Tell him how you did it;student:What I did first for my estimate is,2
teacher:Did you talk to Asher about that,2
teacher:Youre saying he couldve just done 9  2;student:We got four it would count as a zero because the estimate is an estimate its not like a real answer,2
teacher:Whos got something they want to tell Asher though first,2
teacher:Anyone want to talk about that one;student:Then 7291 and then I  29 hundredths and I got 219 hundredths,2
teacher:Do we agree with what Alexander did;student:291 thousandths,2
teacher:Disagree with anything,2
teacher:Do we agree with Hudson,2
teacher:All right friends I need you to expand upon what he said because he said you need three grids,2
teacher:It actually make his estimate that you can use,2
teacher:Bruce you did the same am I right;student:Yes,2
teacher:Zoey can you add to that;student:When we align these numbers and decimals they only get scrambled up or like say you have a one and 10 you just flip a 10 by the one and  You put the,2
teacher:Lisa help him;student:You round up,2
teacher:Asher can you helpCooper with what I asked him to do,2
teacher:Okay help her with that please,2
teacher:Okay Franc can you help my friend Clay with the one little error he made and explain why;student:And I touched them all for  number well seven and 31 tens,2
teacher:Okay add to it Georgia;student:the numbers and make patterns with numbers,2
teacher:Do you see his estimate is not just rewriting the problem,2
teacher:The same one,2
teacher:Expand and clarify his thinking exactly,2
teacher:Kayla what would you like to add,2
teacher:Becca Im going to ask you to phone a friend thats got their hand up in the air,2
teacher:If you dont agree have the discussion at the table as to why,2
teacher:Make sure you agree,2
teacher:You are done with all the math boxes Kirsten and Charlotte would you please compare,2
teacher:If you dont know I want you to call a friend,2
teacher:How could she miss that the highest weigh number with a smaller fraction,2
teacher:Who can help him out with that,2
teacher:Zoey want to expand upon them,2
teacher:Call a friend,2
teacher:Call a friend to help you out,2
teacher:Will you call a friend for help;student:A mixed number is a number that is,2
teacher:I want you to coach him through this,2
teacher:Please phone a friend that can build off your thinking,2
teacher:Would you phone a friend to add to your thinking,2
teacher:Do you have anything different than what they have,2
teacher:Do we all agree using grids would not be an efficient way to do this,2
teacher:Call a friend if you dont know,2
teacher:Did you use a different strategy in one,2
teacher:How do you think people came up with 126,2
teacher:What do we think;student:So 35,2
teacher:Mia do you remember what he said;student:No,2
teacher:Danielle argues that you could use gummy sharks to measure the volume,2
teacher:Danielle what do you say about gummy sharks,2
teacher:Agree disagree or add on would you use a ruler to measure the volume of the gingerbread house,2
teacher:Ivy can you add to that,2
teacher:Who can add on to that Maria,2
teacher:Okay Team 1 what do we see about Team 2,2
teacher:Can you two look at each others work and see where the discrepancy is,2
teacher:Sydney do you just want to walk around and see if anyone needs help,2
teacher:How many of you think number five is right,2
teacher:How many of you think number four is right,2
teacher:How many of you think number three is right,2
teacher:How many of you think number two is right,2
teacher:How many of you think number one is right,2
teacher:Talk as a table who you thinks right,2
teacher:Whos right,2
teacher:How many of you want me to tell you which ones right,2
teacher:Anybody have a different way of saying that,2
teacher:Does his answer match Alicias,2
teacher:Before I add them I have to change them because what did Rob tell us,2
teacher:Do you want to have her tell you again,2
teacher:What did she say;student:Yes you did,2
teacher:Tell me a little bit more about why you agree,2
teacher:You agree,2
teacher:Talk to Louis about what Louis did you agree or disagree,2
teacher:Can you check with your group to see if anybody needs help with this,2
teacher:Hey could you check with a friend to see whether youre doing it right or not;student:I dont know,2
teacher:Was his strategy pretty different,2
teacher:Are her other number models correct,2
teacher:What should Marianne multiply first,2
teacher:Rob you want to give her some help,2
teacher:Does her math add up,2
teacher:Did Harper need to skip count 79,2
teacher:What do you notice about how Harper solved the problem;student:Weve only got more than five minutes,2
teacher:You want to use a different strategy,2
teacher:What did Rob tell us we have to do when were multiplying a fraction,2
teacher:Has Marianne drawn number models to multiply the denominators together,2
teacher:What do you think,2
teacher:If you understand something and somebody at your table doesnt talk to them about it Carlos,2
teacher:Everybody agree with that;student:You left with a sack and you have three marbles leftover to fill up a sack but you dont have all the five and you need five have to fill up the sacks you got three out of five left,2
teacher:Does it do it any good for Mr Chance to have an answer onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth if he doesnt know what it means;student:No,2
teacher:Everybody is in agreement that I have one whole;student:Yes,2
teacher:Really Knox what did he just do,2
teacher:Everybody agree,2
teacher:Everybody agrees or anybody who does not agree,2
teacher:Do you all agree,2
teacher:Can anybody follow up on that,2
teacher:Does it do Tanner any good to have threesixth plus threesixth equals one whole if he doesnt know what it means;student:No,2
teacher:Please tell your classmates what you just told me why that is correct,2
teacher:Why dont we multiply six times three and get 18 on the bottom,2
teacher:Why is that correct,2
teacher:Talk as your table why is that correct,2
teacher:Why;student:Yes,2
teacher:Now is that correct,2
teacher:But are they the same amount;student:It takes two pieces to make,2
teacher:Heres my question are those the same thing,2
teacher:Why,2
teacher:Is he right first off,2
teacher:How many of you think Diana is good at math,2
teacher:Would everybody agree with that,2
teacher:Thea Can you clarify,2
teacher:Who can be able to help,2
teacher:Can anybody help our Mr Parker understand what hes trying to say a little bit more clearly;student:We need to find out how many pieces go We need to find out how many bags we have,2
teacher:Does everyone agree,2
teacher:Lucy how did Leia your teammate get threesixth out of one half,2
teacher:All right everybody agree with those equations so far,2
teacher:Callie do you understand what shes talking about when she says that one half turns into threesixths;student:Yes,2
teacher:Would everyone agree that we have one whole,2
teacher:Everybody;student:Yes,2
teacher:Would everybody agree that thats what we;student:Oh my God thats scary,2
teacher:Everybody agree with that,2
teacher:Would everyone agree that that is what you created with the pieces,2
teacher:So following up that Diana can you help him out finish this out,2
teacher:Does everybody agree,2
teacher:Seth help her out,2
teacher:How many of you think that that is correct,2
teacher:Does everybody understand what shes talking about when she says that,2
teacher:135,2
teacher:Do you agree with her or disagree,2
teacher:Why do you agree,2
teacher:Do you guys agree its 3100;student:3100,2
teacher:Do you agree;student:I wrote 1003 you still get a half 1000100 and you say that 3 under the 100,2
teacher:Do you guys all agree,2
teacher:Talk with your table until you come to an agreement,2
teacher:Talk with your table come up with an answer you agree on,2
teacher:What do you guys think;student:I got 036,2
teacher:Anybody else agree that 110 is our smallest;student:Gene,2
teacher:Did anybody do it differently,2
teacher:Can we all agree that 1112 is the biggest fraction,2
teacher:Judith did you have a different approach,2
teacher:Did anybody go at a different way when you were putting this together,2
teacher:Josh help him out,2
teacher:Does everyone agree that 13 is greater than 17;student:Smaller,2
teacher:Jade you want to add to it,2
teacher:Okay so we could add three plus three whats another way;student:You can combine it with another three,2
teacher:Somebody find something else;student:Three,2
teacher:Anybody else think 1112 is the biggest,2
teacher:What do we think,2
teacher:Did you see what she did;student:Like this one this fraction at the bottom I divided by 2 and the top I also divided by 2 and then I got 610,2
teacher:You agree,2
teacher:Did you pick up what hes saying;student:Because 10 isnt the same denominator as a hundred so I had to make that all the same thing in order to,2
teacher:Give me a thumbs up if you got 28 as your answer,2
teacher:Did anyone else come up with the same answer,2
teacher:Yes you want to add something to that,2
teacher:Do you agree;student:12  14  18  18,2
teacher:Was anybody able to prove it a different way,2
teacher:Do you agree with that,2
teacher:Do you agree;student:14,2
teacher:Do you agree with that;student:Yes,2
teacher:Does everybody agree,2
teacher:Do you agree with that;student:56,2
teacher:Was Martin super wrong;student:Yes,2
teacher:Pick somebody to help you out,2
teacher:In order to go from one to 32 she had to multiply by,2
teacher:What do you think she multiplied our numerator and denominator by,2
teacher:Did anybody else have 26 on their list;student:26,2
teacher:Do we agree,2
teacher:Agree,2
teacher:What do you think,2
teacher:Gabriella what do you think;student:Four eighths,2
teacher:Agree or disagree,2
teacher:Who can add on to that because I know if I skip count by sevens I can also get to 35,2
teacher:What does she know about 8 and 16 as they relate to 24,2
teacher:Whos feeling brave about interpreting someone elses thinking,2
teacher:Who can tell me what she did next after she drew the 24 dots,2
teacher:I want to hear from someone else who used a picture to solve the problem but maybe their picture looked a little different from Lindsays;student:4 8 12 16 yes,2
teacher:Stand up if you did something similar,2
teacher:Grant why do you agree;student:Agree,2
teacher:Why did you use that number sentence,2
teacher:Can you chat with them about why they chose to use those pictures,2
teacher:Do you see what your classmates have done,2
teacher:Whats another way of saying that Lindsay,2
teacher:Who wrote a different answer that is equivalent to 2 and 2224;student:2224,2
teacher:What did these students need to do Gabby,2
teacher:What should they have done,2
teacher:What did you hear her last say;student:You cannot subtract 18 from 20,2
teacher:Feel free if youre feeling really stuck ask your neighbor Why did you draw that picture,2
teacher:Give me a thumbs up if you agree with what Gabriella is saying,2
teacher:Someone over at Miguels table repeat what Paula said,2
teacher:What do you notice about your tape diagram and the one that Paula drew,2
teacher:Do you guys agree;student:Yes,2
teacher:What did I hear over there,2
teacher:Do you agree,2
teacher:Do you agree with that;student:One,2
teacher:Sorry Austin Ive got people that disagree with you,2
teacher:Its one half is it one half;student:Its one half,2
teacher:Maggie whats a clue you can give her,2
teacher:Its in fourths so is she on the right track;student:Its in fourths,2
teacher:Who can help Angela with maybe a hint about what to do next to find the answer,2
teacher:Who can help Angela with an idea of what to draw to help her solve this problem;student:Just think about it for a second yes,2
teacher:How could you use Paulas tape diagram to help you find the answer Eileen,2
teacher:All right Eileen tell us more about what Paula did,2
teacher:Jeremiah whyd she split it into fourths,2
teacher:How many pieces did Paula split the tape diagram into;student:What I see in Paulas tape diagram is that she figured out that she should split the diagram into fourths,2

teacher:She takes less time to run the same distance;student:Dallas is the faster runner because she takes less time to run the same distance,3
teacher:141 for nine tickets;student:141 for nine tickets,3
teacher:Divide by three,3
teacher:Scale down unit rate,3
teacher:How long they did it for;student:How long they did it for,3
teacher:Miles;student:Miles,3
teacher:It is how far youve gone;student:Its just like a,3
teacher:10 and one;student:Were going to have 10 and one,3
teacher:Youre on the right track but were not worried about how long its going to take us;student:I think what can help us is eight and 40 because you cant Well you can add something to eight to get 40 but its going to take a long time,4
teacher:So if you didnt hear what Alexia just said Alexia just said that eight times five equals 40 but eight plus 12 only equals;student:equals 40,4
teacher:Adding more by adding zeros thats beautiful,4
teacher:So if we choose multiplication to get from three to 15 we have to multiply by five,4
teacher:Good except say it in the right order three times six;student:The six and three,4
teacher:So we would have to add 12 to get 15 out of the mouth,4
teacher:So I put three Mr Ember into the ear of the robot,4
teacher:So you want to do addition,4
teacher:So we set up the problem with the common denominator being 12,4
teacher:So Ember has chosen to use the bottom clue at the very bottom three and 15;student:Three and 15,4
teacher:Were either going to be using subtraction or division,4
teacher:So draw your robot out,4
teacher:So the rule for this one is divide by four,4
teacher:Im going to get a negative three which we dont do in fourth grade yet;student:You going to get a negative three,4
teacher:This one is smaller than this one,4
teacher:Three clues;student:Three,4
teacher:Were going to add six,4
teacher:Oh I dont like using the word plus;student:Plus six,4
teacher:So Im going to put an addition symbol and Im going to put a multiplication symbol right there,4
teacher:Zero so thats why were going to use extended facts today;student:Zero,4
teacher:Very good the unknown;student:The unknown,4
teacher:Q c d  Quick common denominator;student:QDC,4
teacher:So we have to figure out a rule,4
teacher:All right so we are all in agreement and I am too that the answer to this question is 56,4
teacher:Five times 600 okie dokie;student:And the equation for that one would be five times 600,4
teacher:Which I did I added my zero;student:And then you put the zero after the six,4
teacher:The ones place right;student:The ones,4
teacher:No 40 is already done;student:I was trying to say 40,4
teacher:Subtracted is past tense;student:Also is subtracting past tense,4
teacher:Beautiful shes going to use 40 and six;student:40 and six,4
teacher:Beautiful so Hadley will put 40 times 90;student:40 and 90,4
teacher:Very good so shes going to need a 90 in her first spot and a six in her second spot;student:90 and six,4
teacher:60 and two beautiful you are correct;student:60 and two,4
teacher:Its worth three;student:Three,4
teacher:Okay so Hadley is going to write 40 in her first teen number,4
teacher:Not another zero two more zeros because that first zero is part of your original answer;student:Another zero,4
teacher:I am a dog well thats not very nice to call your Mr Parker a dog;student:I am a dog,4
teacher:First box;student:I just picked the first problem,4
teacher:Two so we got our 36 which you told me and now we put our two zeros in;student:Two,4
teacher:Very good we have 63 and theres one zero between them;student:One,4
teacher:Good its counting up by 80s but not just in incremental tubes its going up by incremental fours;student:Its counting up by 80s,4
teacher:Kay good so youre talking the column for 300;student:In the first example the  column with 300 it counts up by 300,4
teacher:So write five zeros next to your 56 and congratulations,4
teacher:Five total zeros;student:Five,4
teacher:Lets not say 56,4
teacher:Is your answer to that problem start with 56 because you know its gotta be 56 cause its seven times eight,4
teacher:No and yes;student:No,4
teacher:So Id have 70 of these,4
teacher:Ten times 50okay;student:Ten times 50 it should give us 500 then,4
teacher:Okay well 56 goes to the tenths place;student:70 is in the tenths place not the ones,4
teacher:were taking around a half close to a whole  close to half;student:A half,4
teacher:Just multiplication;student:T is it just multiplication in general or,4
teacher:So one thing Im going to tell you is I get the you rounded in nine tenths up of 10 tenths and eight tenths up to 10 tenths  just in terms of the math language you said you rounded to 10 but you really rounded to 10 tenths;student:if my estimate is correct my answer will be close to zero,4
teacher:Threefourths of that onesixth;student:So we have onesixth of a birthday cake,4
teacher:So seven batches of eight cookies;student:How many cookies did he bake,4
teacher:Zero eighths isnt really a fraction;student:Everyone else ate zero eighths,4
teacher:So for question B youre using for example is you wrote 22 youre multiplying 45 times  22 to get an equivalent fraction;student:What does it mean by using the fractions for question B,4
teacher:Multiplicative identity property yes;student:Multiplicative identity property,4
teacher:Less than you said it five;student:Our product is going to be,4
teacher:Because I know a half is less than one;student:Because even though a half is going to be smaller than its going to be the same number it just adds to the whole even though it starts bigger,4
teacher:Just 5 the whole number;student:Do the fives mean like this,4
teacher:So if I multiply 25 by 33 Im multiplying by one;student:one whole,4
teacher:Four times six;student:Six,4
teacher:Not the exact same;student:So were doing the exact same,4
teacher:Well it says notice that the numerator is the double shaded portion;student:With the numerator I do notice that in her picture that she did show the numerator which is double shades,4
teacher:To start with the numerator;student:The numerator and denominator is what I noticed,4
teacher:So Im just going to start by splitting it in twothirds,4
teacher:Answer to a multiplication or problem;student:An answer to a multiplication problem,4
teacher:So now we need to fold it So we have it in fourths now we need it to fold it the other way in thirds;student:Thirds,4
teacher:You can write how you and Nate did it;student:Thats not how me and Nate do it,4
teacher:15 divided by five is three;student:Five times three,4
teacher:Repeated addition;student:Repeated,4
teacher:Mmhmm  half;student:Its like the half of the number,4
teacher:Two zeros;student:None two,4
teacher:So they said theyre going to multiply the X coordinate by six;student:Oh they multiply both parts,4
teacher:They used addition somewhere;student:They used addition instead of multiplication,4
teacher:So I was looking at how many times 8 went into 21;student:8 times 2 is 16,4
teacher:No not nevermind;student:inauidble nevermind,4
teacher:Because its one a whole;student:Its because 22 is technically 1,4
teacher:Twentyfour okay,4
teacher:Ill tell ya how I got four thirds;student:But how did you get 43rds,4
teacher:it was inauidble a trade first but we were re Whoo,4
teacher:So our answer is one and two thirds;student:One,4
teacher:So Kaliahs telling us Duke we have to take this three Turn it into a two;student:But you have to turn three into two and add it to go once or be four,4
teacher:Alright so what youre telling me is that in number one you have four minus one and you can just do three;student:So number you can subtract one from the four but number two you cant subtract two from inauidble,4
teacher:keep going I know you know how to explain it;student:Yeah And then different is I dont know how to explain,4
teacher:Alex I guess seven and 500ths;student:I got seven and five hundredths,4
teacher:It would go pretty close to zero,4
teacher:Its closer to two;student:Closer to two,4
teacher:No because its closer to two than it is to three;student:Oh so would I have bumped it up to a three,4
teacher:Two and one fourth is closer to two than it is to three;student:I kind of made a Because at my old school what we would do when were estimating fractions Well just bump one up so I bumped the two up to a four and then I did four plus four,4
teacher:One and one half one and a half and one and a half its the same;student:I thought you said one and one half,4
teacher:Thats what I literally just said the answer would be a little more than one half;student:A little more than one half,4
teacher:So we agree that it should be a little more than two because we started at one and three fourths and added more than a fourth so it would be a little bit past two,4
teacher:So  what youre saying is you already started at one and three fourths which is right here,4
teacher:So you put it between one and a half and two;student:I put it in between one and one half and two,4
teacher:Thats why the 2 goes there,4
teacher:No its not 4 x 2;student:No the 4 x the 2,4
teacher:and the 2 here;student:And the 2,4
teacher:set of steps;student:Stepbystep way to do something,4
teacher:I noticed a lot of people got 2920;student:Well 2920,4
teacher:So then you did 8 x 6 is 48 okay,4
teacher:Okay so you what you have remembered was you left on your board is that 3 x 9 was 27;student:So if I threw in zeros it would be 27 and then plus a 2 and then 3 you put a comma,4
teacher:It would be 18 if you were doing 14 divided by two;student:Would it be 18,4
teacher:Two zeros;student:Um two,4
teacher:There are two;student:Two,4
teacher:Hadley is the winner of round number one but the rounds not over;student:Hadley,4
teacher:You mean one of these is half of a pint;student:I notice that for the cup half of it goes into a pint,4
teacher:Clearly not;student:No,4
teacher:Theyre the same amount;student:The same amount,4
teacher:Cups;student:Is it cup,4
teacher:So thats 18 and then we have to do 13 times 2,4
teacher:You get eight;student:I think the eight,4
teacher:Theyre giving us the cups;student:Theyre giving us a cup,4
teacher:We multiply 5 by 2 and that will give us 10,4
teacher:There are four quarts in a gallon,4
teacher:So as we go down as you look at each one of the appendages thats the arms and fingers and so forth what Joanna noticed was we go gallon quart quart pint pint pint pint cup cup cup cup,4
teacher:16 cups;student:There are 16,4
teacher:Pints good;student:I see on both sides of the hand each side has cup and pint,4
teacher:Passthrough point;student:Passthrough,4
teacher:I use lines;student:Lines,4
teacher:Two pointsYou re gonna want to write that down;student:Two,4
teacher:I labeled them beautiful;student:You labeled them,4
teacher:Oh yeah;student:Yes,4
teacher:It is called a ray;student:Is it called a ray,4
teacher:You guys think of that as a line but its not,4
teacher:Where something starts or something ends;student:A point is where something starts,4
teacher:It is a point;student:Its a point,4
teacher:We will not refer to those as dots in this classroom,4
teacher:121 then you get 144,4
teacher:One half;student:Half,4
teacher:An odd number of factors;student:Odd,4
teacher:A whole or a set;student:A whole,4
teacher:Negative eight score,4
teacher:You added three groups of three;student:Added like three groups of three,4
teacher:You can always look back and figure out how to fix something to make it better;student:When you take a video of yourself you can always look back on it and figure out how you can fix it,4
teacher:Okay multiply a number by another number;student:Multiplication is when you multiply a number with another number,4
teacher:Well three threes is nine so;student:Nine,4
teacher:Its a three by three array;student:Thats a three by three array,4
teacher:In Con Academy okay;student:In Con Academy,4
teacher:Chloe says Lets add these all together and the answer they want is what this equals,4
teacher:Ooh 464;student:I got 464,4
teacher:In all means lets add them all up;student:We want to add them all up and whatever we get is the answer,4
teacher:Empire State Building;student:The Empire State,4
teacher:100 stories,4
teacher:Can use 60 because six plus four equals 10,4
teacher:Youre thinking 60,4
teacher:And then they get stuck into spending money again,4
teacher:Yes maybe part of your paycheck;student:Maybe it was a paycheck,4
teacher:It does look like a heartbeat;student:It goes  like a heartbeat that goes,4
teacher:Its a lot;student:Thats a lot,4
teacher:Negative 80;student:No negative,4
teacher:11 you got it,4
teacher:Day 14 okay;student:Day 14,4
teacher:One awesome;student:One,4
teacher:Two nice Aiden;student:Two,4
teacher:Four nice;student:Four,4
teacher:We only have one;student:One,4
teacher:Is six;student:Six,4
teacher:An even number of factors;student:An even number,4
teacher:1 2 3;student:Two,4
teacher:Three times three equals nine four times three equals 12,4
teacher:10 good,4
teacher:So it would be a trapezoid and a rhombus,4
teacher:A hexagon;student:Hexagon,4
teacher:And multiply it times 40;student:Im going to take the five from the 265 and add it times 40,4
teacher:So youre going to multiply six times 40;student:Im going to take the six and jump over the five,4
teacher:So our largest place value on the left is 200 and we move it and we multiply it by our largest place value on the right,4
teacher:So were going to start with our 200;student:So you need to multiply the 200,4
teacher:Youd get a five;student:Five,4
teacher:My regrouping was wrong;student:Your regrouping,4
teacher:45 with no zero,4
teacher:I dont need to do anything fancy there its just 70,4
teacher:You could move it or you could just write your numbers neat and organized up here;student:You could move them here,4
teacher:I have two;student:Two,4
teacher:The decimal point;student:The decimal,4
teacher:Right it should be a five;student:Five,4
teacher:80 times 70;student:80 and 70,4
teacher:Beautiful 90 and nine;student:90 and nine,4
teacher:Seven is worth 70 and four is worth four,4
teacher:99 thats all shes got left,4
teacher:No at first it does not matter at all;student:No,4
teacher:I write down all the different cards I have;student:You write down the cards you have,4
teacher:Hadley definitely would have won that won had there not been the issue at the adding;student:Hadley,4
teacher:10 times 10 is 100 nine times 10 is 90,4
teacher:They are all odd numbers;student:Odd,4
teacher:Onehalf;student:One,4
teacher:Its right;student:Right,4
teacher:Theres 6;student:Six,4
teacher:I listed the factors;student:Factors,4
teacher:He said that theres going to be an open then two closed then an open and he thought that there were going to be three closed but theres actually four closed then theres an open then theres 123456 closed,4
teacher:Havent gotten to the seventh person,4
teacher:Charlie look twos closed;student:Two,4
teacher:The fifth locker;student:The fifth,4
teacher:One can go into all of them;student:Yeah,4
teacher:12 is a multiple of 123 and four;student:Its because its a multiple,4
teacher:Theyre gonna reopen number six then we go to nine its open were going to close it;student:Open it,4
teacher:Every third locker;student:Every third,4
teacher:So your sample size was 10,4
teacher:So you set up eight lockers;student:And then,4
teacher:So Im changing this to 210;student:210,4
teacher:Yes;student:Yeah,4
teacher:Our numerator is half of our  denominator,4
teacher:Theyve been even numbers;student:Even,4
teacher:Would be 12,4
teacher:And if we get rid of these two cuts now we have a giant piece out of the whole which would represent onefourth,4
teacher:I have to divide;student:We have to divide,4
teacher:So Miss Genevieve you started with oneeighth plus twoeighths equals threeeighths,4
teacher:Youll have seven lines to cut it into eight pieces;student:Seven,4
teacher:We can divide this fraction by three;student:Divide it by three,4
teacher:They say they only use a unit fraction one time,4
teacher:They want it into ninths because they want to make the fraction fourninths;student:Nine,4
teacher:Revise their thinking about it like editing;student:I think thats what everybodys trying to say,4
teacher:Yes because its an even number;student:Yes,4
teacher:Coordinates yes;student:Coordinate,4
teacher:So here to make 40ths we multiplied the fifth times eight,4
teacher:No it does not because it doesnt end in five or zero;student:No,4
teacher:Four times nine;student:Four nines,4
teacher:Three times 12,4
teacher:Yes it does;student:Yes,4
teacher:Okay so factors of 36 would be one and 36,4
teacher:12 20 32,4
teacher:Four 28ths thats awesome;student:Four 28ths,4
teacher:Six 24ths awesome;student:Six 24ths,4
teacher:Yeah its a picture of something;student:Something that  so kind of like a picture of something,4
teacher:Were going to attach three zeros,4
teacher:Okay so we have groups A and B;student:A class split a big chocolate bar between group A and B,4
teacher:How many apples yep did Jordan eat;student:How many apples they ate,4
teacher:Jordan ate 23 of the apples,4
teacher:Of a basket;student:Apple basket,4
teacher:A fourth of a meter is blue,4
teacher:Oh how much he ate yes;student:How much he ate,4
teacher:How much was eaten yes;student:How much was eaten,4
teacher:Its means the answer;student:Thats the answer,4
teacher:Its area;student:Area,4
teacher:Yeah another equal group problem;student:Yeah equal groups,4
teacher:A square foot;student:And each tiles a foot,4
teacher:I heard chocolate bar,4
teacher:So 96 divided by 3,4
teacher:It would still have a large quotient;student:So it will still have a large quotient,4
teacher:I want the smallest divisor;student:You want the smallest divisor,4
teacher:Yeah three and a fourth;student:Like 3 and one fourth,4
teacher:We know that this is 612ths,4
teacher:It needs to be a half;student:Half,4
teacher:Its five out of 10 of these,4
teacher:Okay so she doesnt think the answer makes sense,4
teacher:Three fifths is already less than two thirds on here,4
teacher:You dont so you know from the algorithm that you dont add the denominator when you have fractions;student:Thats incorrect because you cant add the denominator together,4
teacher:So I can know what you learned,4
teacher:And you actually dont need these extra ones because you could just do five here and two here with solve those parentheses and then just work from left to right,4
teacher:Or 70 times two;student:So I think its easy to do two plus eight first and then turn on that so that 10 times 7 is 70 and 10 times 2,4
teacher:Or nine divided by three;student:And I know that nine if you go down three times it will equal three,4
teacher:Denominator the smaller the denominator or divisor the less youre breaking up that big number;student:Denominator,4
teacher:Dividend or the number that you need to divide up;student:Dividend,4
teacher:Oh theres no explanation;student:The explanation,4
teacher:Okay they could show the work;student:They could show how they did their work,4
teacher:The denominator and the divisor are the same thing;student:I notice the denominator and the divisor are the same thing,4
teacher:Yeah;student:Yes,4
teacher:Five plus five over eight which would be 10 eighths which would be one and two eighths;student:55 and 8,4
teacher:So the numerator is the same as the dividend,4
teacher:Because youre going to have to add your two numerators or your two cards;student:And adding,4
teacher:I mean thats what we practiced in our warmup but we didnt really use attach anything;student:No attached,4
teacher:Well I can put a attach but Im not sure what attach has to do with this;student:No,4
teacher:Divided by would be good;student:Divided by,4
teacher:Oh equal group;student:Itd be equal groups,4
teacher:34 hmm Kay;student:Because 34 is closer to the whole than 912,4
teacher:Its 30 squared which is 900;student:30 squared,4
teacher:We have to round it;student:You have to round it,4
teacher:The slope is undefined;student:Its undefined,4
teacher:Yeah theyre both one half;student:One half,4
teacher:Yeah 24 and 12,4
teacher:Yeah we have angle angle;student:Angle angle,4
teacher:Yeah if you divide by five divided by five you get four thirds;student:By five,4
teacher:Yes the one in the other triangle;student:Yeah,4
teacher:The 90s are the same;student:The 90s right,4
teacher:One pair of parallel sides;student:They are parallel lines,4
teacher:Just one;student:One,4
teacher:Three minus a negative three is really adding;student:Shouldnt that be minus,4
teacher:Its opposite sides are parallel;student:The opposite sides are parallel,4
teacher:Its the point inbetween the two points,4
teacher:Yes negative X because its on the other side;student:Its negative X for five,4
teacher:Isosceles trapezoid thats right;student:Trapezoid,4
teacher:Yeah zero is for Y because its on the Xaxis youre not going up or down;student:Yeah,4
teacher:Yeah zero for Y Yeah;student:Zero Y,4
teacher:J O J;student:J,4
teacher:Yeah its H Thats why this is going to get a little tricky;student:H,4
teacher:Yeah where the lines intersect;student:Where the lines intersect,4
teacher:S T is also B;student:S T,4
teacher:Yeah theyre not going side to side so the xvalue is zero and then they all have a different Yvalue;student:They all have an Xvalue of zero,4
teacher:The origin;student:Origin,4
teacher:Five okay;student:Five,4
teacher:Yeah X equals zero;student:No X equals zero,4
teacher:Its between one and two;student:One and two,4
teacher:The Y values;student:Y,4
teacher:They changed;student:Changed,4
teacher:Two Pi;student:Pi,4
teacher:Or the great circle;student:The great circle,4
teacher:The circus the Circumference;student:Thats the circumcise,4
teacher:Im trying to find the radius;student:Radius,4
teacher:Were going to use tangent;student:Tangent,4
teacher:So when you subtract the bases to get 14 and then divide by two to get seven,4
teacher:Yeah;student:Yes,4
teacher:Not yet;student:No,4
teacher:44 root 3 thats right;student:So then the area would be 44 root 3,4
teacher:4 x squared root of 3;student:Root three,4
teacher:The base is 10 because this entire thing is 10;student:Why is the base 10,4
teacher:Yep its 10;student:Yeah,4
teacher:461 units squared;student:It will be 461,4
teacher:Its the adjacent side;student:Adjacent,4
teacher:Its the opposite side;student:Opposite,4
teacher:You do not know the base;student:We do not,4
teacher:48 okay thank you,4
teacher:Pythagorean theorem right;student:Pythagorean theorem,4
teacher:Yeah you go to the short leg;student:Dont you go to  the smallest one and divide,4
teacher:We do;student:Yes,4
teacher:Yeah you flip flop them and you switch the signs for both;student:Yeah,4
teacher:Yeah just the opposite;student:The opposite,4
teacher:Negative eight thats to the left eight;student:Negative eight comma zero,4
teacher:Stayed the same;student:Same,4
teacher:One so theres one half so its gonna be bigger than two;student:One,4
teacher:26 divided by four four goes into 26 six times and there are two leftover so its more than six and less than seven,4
teacher:So one way to show the 21 divided by five is also we could do this 12345678910 1112 1314 1516 1718 1920 21,4
teacher:Okay so the shaded;student:The blocks that are shaded,4
teacher:There are 12 equal parts;student:Because theres 12 sections,4
teacher:Equals six;student:Six twelfths,4
teacher:Equals three 16ths;student:Equals,4
teacher:And a whole;student:A whole,4
teacher:You shaded two thirds of this;student:I shaded,4
teacher:Three thirds the whole is the whole three thirds;student:I said three thirds,4
teacher:The denominator is three;student:Three,4
teacher:Two over three;student:Three,4
teacher:So there would be eight;student:Eight,4
teacher:Three it looks just like this;student:Three,4
teacher:Theyre not the same because now youre starting with 20 multiply 20 by three;student:Theyre gonna all be the same,4
teacher:Fifth is four;student:Four,4
teacher:It is very hard to explain;student:Its kind of hard to explain,4
teacher:So dividing something by five is the same as taking one fifth of something;student:I noticed that dividing by five is the same as,4
teacher:So you you thought about it in terms of multiplication,4
teacher:So we would multiple five times three;student:quick common denominator  five times three,4
teacher:Now they have a common denominator;student:Yes because theyre common denominators,4
teacher:Would be five twelfths;student:The answer to that one  five twelfths,4
teacher:Four fourths to get four twelfths;student:Four fourths,4
teacher:Okay so you would use the quick common denominator method for finding the common denominator;student:I think I would multiply the denominators together to see what the common denominator is,4
teacher:So now we can subtract four thirds minus two thirds to get two thirds and two minus one is one,4
teacher:Yeah so the denominators are different;student:Theyre different denominators,4
teacher:Okay double shaded;student:Double shaded,4
teacher:So theres a whole number in a mixed number,4
teacher:How many parts it takes to make a whole,4
teacher:So the 10 would be shaded if you did the area model and thats really all it is;student:Thered be 10 squares total in the whole entire rectangle,4
teacher:Lets do 81 first,4
teacher:So we have threefourths closest to onehalf,4
teacher:This is a city block;student:It says its a city block if you do it at the bottom,4
teacher:You say its 22;student:To the pizzeria we have about 15 and then once we finally are at 15 and we count the rest of the squares I say you get 22,4
teacher:One two three four five six seven eight nine 10;student:I think you have to walk 10 blocks,4
teacher:Three and 615 thousandths;student:Three and six fifteenths,4
teacher:So that would mean that half of one of these was filled;student:My halfway number is three and 618 thousandths,4
teacher:363 theres something that comes after this one;student:I think that it would be 363,4
teacher:Not 60 cents;student:Cents,4
teacher:Because the other different might be greater than zero;student:Because the other digit would be greater than zero,4
teacher:Four squares;student:Squares,4
teacher:Two tenths;student:Tenths,4
teacher:Yeah a hundred squares and then a thousand rectangles;student:Actually a hundred squares,4
teacher:Yep a thousand rectangles;student:But those are rectangles,4
teacher:The hundredths place;student:Maybe hundredths,4
teacher:I was looking for that word expanded form,4
teacher:Three times five is 15;student:15,4
teacher:Yeah there were 12 pieces total they ate three of them,4
teacher:The whole casserole;student:Casserole the entire thing,4
teacher:So group A took this;student:So they probably just thought it was  and they could forget about it,4
teacher:So how much group B took,4
teacher:It is the whole because that is the question that they set up here;student:The amount of the whole casserole that group B took,4
teacher:nan;student:Fifteenths,4
teacher:So he said five by six,4
teacher:Xaxis Im going to say ordered pairs;student:Is it  to say the xaxis,4
teacher:Okay so he found an equivalent fraction for 12 with the denominator of 8 so he knew that 12 was equivalent to 48;student:And then I did 48  18 which equals 58,4
teacher:900 four and 8000,4
teacher:Plus one sixth thats awesome;student:One sixth,4
teacher:Four 8ths plus two 8ths so a half plus I have to think about that;student:Two 8ths,4
teacher:We already have four eighths;student:Four eighths,4
teacher:You can use fraction circles if we had them out and was talking about sixths;student:You could use fraction circles,4
teacher:Yeah so we cant make half out of thirds;student:Its thirds,4
teacher:Cause I think one third plus one half is equal to two fifths and,4
teacher:And a fourth is less than a half,4
teacher:Okay so one half is bigger than three eighths,4
teacher:So if she knows that two fourths is equal to one half,4
teacher:The denominator;student:Denominator,4
teacher:Yeah if the sizes of the pieces arent equal you cant add them;student:Because if theyre not equivalent and if they have different denominators like one and six you cant add them together,4
teacher:If its a different answer I can talk to you about your different way;student:I think I have one more way to do it but its a different answer,4
teacher:Well a half is the thing yeah this is the thing our estimates are two minus one and a half is a half;student:Yeah and the half,4
teacher:Okay so then added three plus one and one fourth to get four and one fourth;student:And I got a whole with a remainder of one fourth so four and one fourth,4
teacher:Four and a half because one plus three fourths is really close to two and a half;student:Four and a half,4
teacher:Its four thirds;student:Four thirds,4
teacher:Its 20 million;student:20 million,4
teacher:Thats not a million;student:Ninetyfive million,4
teacher:Yes so 7 is in the thousands place in the seven hundred thousand in 7000;student:The 7 is in the thousands place,4
teacher:We use fraction circles;student:Fraction circles,4
teacher:We used a number line;student:A number line,4
teacher:So she could make she can multiply 21 fifths by two halves,4
teacher:So like if we thought about you took out five;student:So five times five and three times five is 15 and four fives,4
teacher:This is one and 13,4
teacher:So if we do so if I were to break this up into place values this would be one this would be tens this would be hundreds this would be thousands,4
teacher:Read it again;student:You could probably read it in your own words,4
teacher:Yeah think about what you know this is where you can use a highlighter;student:You can think about what you know about the problem,4
teacher:Multiply one of the coordinates by two yep;student:Because the instructions told you that you need to multiply it by two,4
teacher:Or the X axis by two whatever the rule was,4
teacher:Taller mmhmm;student:It would get taller,4
teacher:Yeah the second coordinate;student:Oh the second,4
teacher:10 and zero;student:10 zero,4
teacher:Dont say longer;student:Because it says you double the first one but it would be longer because the first number is always going to be longer and youre doubling that so it would make it longer,4
teacher:By two;student:Two times,4
teacher:Longer and wider okay;student:I thought it was going to be longer and wider,4
teacher:Its going to be two times the size,4
teacher:So you would divide it by two;student:But you divide by half and then you just get it exactly halfway,4
teacher:Half yes;student:Half of it,4
teacher:Two times greater;student:Its times two,4
teacher:Three and one half;student:Three,4
teacher:Okay so so its gonna its gonna expand out;student:I think its also be a little bigger but I think its gonna be like a stop sign like up there like smooshed and then its inaudible,4
teacher:Okay a little bigger but a different shape;student:I think it might be a little bigger but a different shape Because youre leaving one the same,4
teacher:210th I know is is going to be less than a well its going to be less than a fourth,4
teacher:He has to be at the pizzeriaa,4
teacher:The park entrance;student:Park entrance,4
teacher:So you have to go six horizontally no matter what;student:And so even if we go four up to the five and then go over two youve got to add the four horizontal plus the two horizontal equals the six plus,4
teacher:Yeah its three fourths;student:Three fourths,4
teacher:So he drew 13,4
teacher:Okay thats what you can do with the remainder;student:When theres a remainder you can ignore it or put it as a fraction,4
teacher:So theres if you count the zeros theres 1 zero 2 3 4,4
teacher:Uhhuh or a friend;student:Your partner,4
teacher:Five so if I were to describe this array I might say that this is a five by five;student:Five,4
teacher:It would be between the squares;student:Yeah in between,4
teacher:You counted by fives;student:Counting by five,4
teacher:Two and a half;student:Negative one half,4
teacher:One there you go okay;student:One,4
teacher:Yeah three and a half;student:Because you double five thats 10 and then three one halves so its half,4
teacher:It would be right there;student:It would go right there,4
teacher:Oh double the first number halve the second number;student:Were doubling this number,4
teacher:Yeah;student:Yes,4
teacher:One two put your dot right there;student:Eighttwo and then fivetwo,4
teacher:Write two because I leave it alone;student:Write two,4
teacher:Because youve got a 16 there;student:Thats one and then,4
teacher:The second number stays the same as the first one,4
teacher:Get bigger;student:Big,4
teacher:Okay so zero;student:The zerothree,4
teacher:To make sure shes logged which ones shes done;student:To see which ones Ive done,4
teacher:Yeah you can even add;student:Yeah you can just add,4
teacher:Or two times two is four sorry;student:Four,4
teacher:Twofourths;student:Since they both have the same denominator if you subtract threefourths from onefourth that gets you two well,4
teacher:So Michael you see that seveneighths,4
teacher:So you had zero;student:I had zero,4
teacher:Just a half okay;student:A half,4
teacher:Yeah and a zero;student:And a zero,4
teacher:Park entrance;student:Park,4
teacher:Seven and 14;student:Seven 14,4
teacher:Okay so 16one 10one 10seven they doubled the first left the second one;student:Youre going to double the first coordinate and then leave the second one the same,4
teacher:Bigger;student:Larger,4
teacher:Zero so its less than;student:Less,4
teacher:Shes doubling only one quadrant;student:it would be bigger because you double it so it would be bigger,4
teacher:I cant do three minus because I have to get all of these to a twelve;student:You just need to do three minus,4
teacher:So five minus one,4
teacher:4 minus one thank you;student:I mean four minus one,4
teacher:437 and sixtenths excellent;student:I got 437 and sixtenths,4
teacher:Taller and wider;student:Its going to be wider and longer,4
teacher:So longer and wider;student:But I changed it to It would be a longer and wider book with four times the X and Y coordinates,4
teacher:Our prediction from problem two was correct because the new picture we drew was six times larger than the X coordinate and Y coordinate,4
teacher:So your original answer was correct and you could have simply just said Because this will make the book larger,4
teacher:So My ending coordinate points would be 16 and 15;student:Coordinates,4
teacher:By her saying We think the X coordinate will be at and the Y coordinate had she done that before then her guess by being able to look at these numbers by just being able to look at your grids you make a statement like that before you finish that out thats what makes your paper a four,4
teacher:I love that you used the word grid;student:And after my rule will be one six and five two,4
teacher:Oh they doubled it;student:They doubled it,4
teacher:The Y coordinate and double the X coordinate;student:The Y coordinate,4
teacher:Bigger is not a description,4
teacher:Yes he did;student:Yes,4
teacher:Youve got to do both of them;student:You need to double the X and the Y,4
teacher:X coordinate and Y coordinate or one and not the other,4
teacher:By how much Im making each coordinate bigger;student:How much youre making it bigger,4
teacher:You have four four and eight 10,4
teacher:It doesnt have a coordinate,4
teacher:10 and four thank you;student:The next one is 10 four,4
teacher:Two and four okay;student:Two and four,4
teacher:Zero zero good job;student:Zero zero,4
teacher:Because I cant walk through walls;student:walking through the wall,4
teacher:You would be walking through buildings;student:Because wed be walking through buildings,4
teacher:12 13,4
teacher:So you started at the pizzeria,4
teacher:A yellow one yellow and one dark blue;student:A yellow,4
teacher:Oh I have four friends;student:You have 4 friends,4
teacher:Okay you are confused on that one;student:I am confused onthis one,4
teacher:So this would be one half;student:One,4
teacher:So 123,4
teacher:Two wholes;student:Two,4
teacher:No you took the mixed number and turned all the sholes into the improper fraction;student:Mixed number,4
teacher:One and 165ths plus 165ths Leftover;student:One 165ths,4
teacher:Not math message;student:Or not math message,4
teacher:So its six and two fourths;student:Two,4
teacher:five and six;student:Five and inauidble,4
teacher:Or three halves;student:You mean three halves,4
teacher:So hes five halves;student:Dan is five fourths,4
teacher:Okay so Im gonna put Rachel right here;student:Rachel,4
teacher:Okay so I want you to place one and 14 on my number line right here;student:Because Dans is Rachels plant is one and one fourth,4
teacher:Two sixths;student:A one and a two,4
teacher:Gary ran further;student:Gary,4
teacher:Its six;student:Is it six,4
teacher:So underneath the zero put the three make it a fraction;student:Zero three,4
teacher:Making mistakes helps me learn;student:Making mistakes helped me learn,4
teacher:I would appreciate you finishing it for asynchronous;student:If we didnt Finish Do we finish it for asynchronous,4
teacher:And I know that I have to do this for these three cans have to last me five days,4
teacher:Oh three cans;student:three cans,4
teacher:Okay but I cant add them together;student:Um so you could so if youre adding you can put them together and see what its like see how much it is together,4
teacher:Minus one and one and a half;student:Minus,4
teacher:So 28th I have a fourth,4
teacher:I am going to teach you the easier way;student:Are you going to do teach us the easier way,4
teacher:Exactly the dot was right there;student:Yesterday when we did the dot we put it in the middle and then put the name here in a square,4
teacher:So one two three four five;student:And then I went up to five,4
teacher:So 11 blocks;student:11,4
teacher:Not one half;student:One half,4
teacher:The two correct;student:Two,4
teacher:So theres 12345678,4
teacher:Closer to three tenths;student:And then I knew it was three tenths,4
teacher:On the one very good;student:The 1,4
teacher:2 hundred and 3,4
teacher:You said I cant we cant do that,4
teacher:Yeah which is greater or 3400 or Mr JACK;student:34 hundreths,4
teacher:Nine tenths very good;student:Tenths,4
teacher:we skipped some things;student:because we skipped,4
teacher:It is minus you are absolutely correct,4
teacher:26th cannot be correct,4
teacher:Three times two,4
teacher:Yep together;student:Together,4
teacher:One and a half;student:one half and one third,4
teacher:Okay so write 14;student:14th,4
teacher:Oh I see your half;student:And then since I have one half,4
teacher:What operation great;student:What operation,4
teacher:Three half;student:Because three because the three,4
teacher:Okay so one fifth is equal to two tenths;student:Two,4
teacher:You knew that two fourths was equivalent to a half;student:To a half,4
teacher:Two times three;student:How is that a two,4
teacher:284 Plus 435;student:Plus 435,4
teacher:Because it said Round to the nearest whole not the tenth;student:Because it said Round to the nearest whole not tenth,4
teacher:Youre probably going to have to add them up,4
teacher:You know if I add eight plus eight plus seven thats 23;student:Three seventyeight one two,4
teacher:So he got 337 papers;student:I mean 337,4
teacher:See you did n minus 900;student:And I was doing minus 900,4
teacher:Yeah subtraction good;student:Subtraction,4
teacher:The number model;student:Were going to be trying to figure out that number like problem,4
teacher:Yeah it could youre right Liliana it could actually be two;student:Its theres two steps to the problem,4
teacher:Oh so id you say 900 is less than 90 hundreds;student:So that means its its right like at the beginning kind of,4
teacher:90 hundredths;student:90,4
teacher:90 hundreds and 009 is 900ths;student:90,4
teacher:yeah I think thats what youre meaning;student:Yeah,4
teacher:And you said 30,4
teacher:Because she doesnt have zeros there,4
teacher:You said it doesnt make it correct,4
teacher:So you add 49 and 49 and then you add 48 and a half too;student:And then I add,4
teacher:Well I used just the remainder;student:Oh so we use remainders not fractions,4
teacher:So it only goes into it eight times;student:Its eight,4
teacher:No because six would be 126;student:No itll be six,4
teacher:Hes 58 inches;student:Smaller,4
teacher:Hes doing the dividing right now;student:Im doing the dividing right now,4
teacher:No I cannot;student:Nope,4
teacher:I did attach it;student:Do you add things,4
teacher:But then I corrected myself;student:Yeah but then you corrected,4
teacher:Okay so just to repeat what you said you divided each pizza into fourths because theres four people;student:And each student got three fourths of the pizza,4
teacher:Or 53 inches;student:No 53 inches,4
teacher:Okay so lets go to that first one theres three pizzas;student:If we have three pizzas there is four student sharing in Forest Preserve five students sharing four pizzas at the corn field,4
teacher:One half and 14 because theres four half pieces;student:A half and a fourth,4
teacher:If you divide by four on the top and bottom you get one fourth;student:One fourth,4
teacher:One whole;student:One,4
teacher:Yes because one fourth plus one fourth is a half;student:Yeah,4
teacher:She divided a half in half,4
teacher:A diagram is a picture and you will want to draw a picture,4
teacher:It does not;student:No,4
teacher:Yes so shes going to divide just half of her land but the older daughter gets more than the other two;student:Yes,4
teacher:She wants to give her land to her children;student:Land,4
teacher:Instead of doing unit fractions she did four eighths plus four eighths,4
teacher:You did tenths;student:I did tenths,4
teacher:He multiplied;student:He did the same thing as me which is use the multiplication times tables,4
teacher:Yes seven 8ths had more and a tiny tiny bit left over;student:That was seven eighths because it had a bigger whole,4
teacher:So youre saying because its really close to a whole theyre the same,4
teacher:So you can say seven eighths is the closest to one whole,4
teacher:So then we have three fourths,4
teacher:Oh Emmetts saying seven eights;student:Seven eighths,4
teacher:Seven eighths is bigger,4
teacher:No I dont think theyre equal;student:They look like theyre equal,4
teacher:Oh so Lacey saying seven eighths is bigger than four fifths;student:I think that seven eighths maybe bigger because theyre a littler pieces but it still makes a big whole,4
teacher:So Frankie says four fifths;student:Because seven eighths movie like smaller slivers and four fifths would be bigger ones,4
teacher:Laceys idea was a rectangle in fifths;student:Like a rectangle,4
teacher:So everybody draw four pizzas;student:Five students share four pizzas,4
teacher:Yeah so a half is two fourths;student:It might be two fourths,4
teacher:So what Hunter is saying one half for the first two and the last one one fourths youre gonna divide fourths;student:Um maybe like the first two we can divide it into one like well in half and then the last one divided into one fourth,4
teacher:Okay you could do circles or you could do cans;student:circles,4
teacher:So our shorter person is 54 inches,4
teacher:You can do it backwards to check;student:So you can do it backwards,4
teacher:So sixteen is the whole;student:Sixteen,4
teacher:Four ninths;student:Ninths,4
teacher:Because it helps you find the area excellent;student:Because it helps you find,4
teacher:Were not doing coordinate grids;student:Me and my partner did um we are doing that the tick marks could be for coordinate grids,4
teacher:And I get fourninths;student:And then you get 4,4
teacher:And nine boxes total;student:And nine total,4
teacher:Ninetynine thousandths is less than so shouldnt it have been true versus your false;student:The the ninetynine thousandths,4
teacher:Nine is greater than eight,4
teacher:Eightyeight hundredths;student:Its one in eightyeights and one,4
teacher:It is a good way;student:Thats a good way to check your answer,4
teacher:We did;student:Yes,4
teacher:So 23 but it wants you to solve the problem down here though;student:2 divided by 3 is 23,4
teacher:So 13 over 1 times 23,4
teacher:So 4 and a third;student:4 remainder 13,4
teacher:Uhuh;student:Yeah,4
teacher:And they said 4,4
teacher:No I didnt multiply the 3 by the numerator;student:numerator,4
teacher:Whole number divided by;student:We said that you could do the whole number divided by the denominator times the numerator for the first one,4
teacher:Okay so multiply 1 and 23 by 15;student:And then you would multiply 1 and 23 by 15,4
teacher:That was easier;student:Because it looked easier,4
teacher:Division in groups;student:Division,4
teacher:Right side of the 1;student:Right,4
teacher:991 or 99 and one tenth;student:991,4
teacher:Thats the larger ones;student:Yeah thats the biggest,4
teacher:Four foot two sorry;student:She said four foot two,4
teacher:The X;student:X,4
teacher:Label the tick marks I love it thank you so very much,4
teacher:You knew that five times four was 20,4
teacher:So Im moving it three times sorry;student:Moving three times,4
teacher:To the right for 120;student:To the right,4
teacher:12 sixteenths,4
teacher:Yes it does;student:Yeah,4
teacher:Equation number story nice job;student:Equation,4
teacher:Length and width okay;student:You shouldve said instead of one way and another way you shouldve said width and length,4
teacher:Six feet;student:Six foot,4
teacher:Okay so real world to a 10yearold would be dividing things and multiplying for school,4
teacher:So real world for you guys is actual homework,4
teacher:Yes;student:Yeah,4
teacher:We agree with that;student:Agree,4
teacher:Some of you say yes some of you say no;student:Yes,4
teacher:So a sword is real a magic wand is not,4
teacher:Fraction circles okay;student:Fraction circle,4
teacher:Okay so you have to break it into bigger pieces;student:Because its big numbers,4
teacher:Because you have the thirds on the bottom and the fourths on the side;student:No x is on the bottom one,4
teacher:Oh your first one is the x sorry your first one is the x and the second one is the y;student:Oh wait no your first ones the x because the x,4
teacher:The y;student:Y,4
teacher:Okay so split it into fourths that way;student:This way,4
teacher:I would like you to do zero point;student:Would you rather us do 06 or just 6,4
teacher:To leave the five very good;student:To leave the five,4
teacher:So if I had to do it to the nearest tenth Connor I have to look at the number in the hundredths space;student:Nearest tenth,4
teacher:Fractions very good;student:Fractions,4
teacher:Yeah 25,4
teacher:So Im going to draw a pizza and Im going to split it into thirds,4
teacher:So you disagree;student:Um no,4
teacher:Yeah we just have smaller pieces;student:Well all of them are going to be the same because just have smaller pieces,4
teacher:No it wont work;student:No,4
teacher:Nine times five;student:Five,4
teacher:Oh eight fortieths;student:And I times two that to get eight fortieths,4
teacher:Two tenths;student:Two on the top and 10 on the bottom,4
teacher:Yeah four twentieths;student:Four and twenty,4
teacher:Yeah,4
teacher:One ninth would not work because whatever you do to the bottom you have to do to the top;student:One ninth,4
teacher:You multiplied this by two;student:Two,4
teacher:Three ninths;student:Three on the top and nine on the bottom,4
teacher:Threeninths thank you;student:Threeninths,4
teacher:By two;student:Two,4
teacher:Two times five;student:Five,4
teacher:We quadrupled it,4
teacher:Three then two times three is six;student:Three sixths,4
teacher:We could also add,4
teacher:These guys we have to double,4
teacher:You take the half and we just cut them in half;student:I see that theyre still halves but theyre just cut in half,4
teacher:So whatever we get here right whatever we get for this answer we just need to double it,4
teacher:12 yeah,4
teacher:Yep were going to do number two right now;student:Were going to do two,4
teacher:Hector needs to sell more than 168 tickets,4
teacher:Nathan has two sixths;student:Two sixths,4
teacher:One times three is three three times three is nine,4
teacher:Twosixths thank you;student:Sorry twosixths,4
teacher:Threethirds is a whole pizza;student:Threethirds,4
teacher:You cant forget trading,4
teacher:Seven okay;student:Seven,4
teacher:Zoe says I know that five times six equals 30,4
teacher:So you got 20 here and your got this here and then you got a total of 28;student:So I added  28,4
teacher:Centimeters squared,4
teacher:Inches squared;student:Inches,4
teacher:Multiply base times height;student:You multiply the base and the height,4
teacher:Youre right and thats what she said because I asked them to be smallest to largest;student:I think its wrong because theyre all the same denominator I think that seven10ths is the biggest because one10th is still a really small piece still is three seven is the biggest one,4
teacher:Mila says one10th three10ths seven10ths;student:One10ths three10ths seven10ths,4
teacher:Nope not onesixth;student:Onesixth,4
teacher:Not onethird;student:The smallest fraction is onethird,4
teacher:So Nathans saying theyre the same because theyre both missing one piece;student:So nine,4
teacher:Nope oh dear;student:No,4
teacher:Nope;student:No,4
teacher:My slices are the same size this one I get nine slices this one I only get six slices,4
teacher:Theyre the same;student:The same,4
teacher:Theyre exactly the same so our pieces are cut up exactly the same;student:Theyre both the same,4
teacher:Bigger okay;student:Bigger,4
teacher:Bigger the denominator smaller the pieces;student:Because twofifths smaller pieces,4
teacher:You can multiply by any number and youre going to get an equivalent fraction;student:So do you just do any number,4
teacher:It would be 400 1000;student:400 100,4
teacher:1025ths;student:10 and 25,4
teacher:By four two times four is eight five times four is 20;student:I multiplied by four,4
teacher:So for this week she sold 28 tickets,4
teacher:So that means we have 35 here and 35 here and 35 here and 35 here,4
teacher:Yeah hes got 50 left,4
teacher:Mmhmm;student:Yes,4
teacher:Okay so you added seven to find your next number;student:I counted seven and then eight and then,4
teacher:Something with adding;student:Maybe its something thats adding,4
teacher:Something with adding;student:Adding,4
teacher:Yes because Im going to throw something new at you;student:Yes,4
teacher:Eight yes;student:Eight,4
teacher:Five and 11 is 55,4
teacher:One and 56;student:One times 56,4
teacher:Product thats right;student:The product,4
teacher:Factors are the numbers that we can put together to multiply something,4
teacher:So a factor is a part of a number,4
teacher:You counted by four;student:I counted by four,4
teacher:You counted by 10s;student:Count by 10s,4
teacher:You counted by twos;student:I counted by two,4
teacher:You were counting by five;student:Five,4
teacher:No I didnt;student:No,4
teacher:Making square numbers;student:Square numbers,4
teacher:28 thats all multiplication that youre doing in there when youre skip counting,4
teacher:Addition yeah;student:No I mean you can solve multiplication using addition,4
teacher:Not division;student:You can solve multiplication by using division,4
teacher:Oh yeah there is a baby square in there;student:And theres another square in the middle of it,4
teacher:16 dots right,4
teacher:This is a three by three;student:A three by three,4
teacher:A two by two;student:Two by three,4
teacher:You counted by seven;student:I counted by seven,4
teacher:Three okay;student:Three,4
teacher:You counted by ones so you added seven each time;student:I counted by ones,4
teacher:Yeah absolutely;student:Yeah,4
teacher:Yeah;student:Yes,4
teacher:Two zeros;student:Two,4
teacher:We got to find the total we have to add them all together;student:Add them together,4
teacher:One were going to add another zero;student:One,4
teacher:20 times 90 you were really close Chloe;student:20 times 90,4
teacher:You split these up;student:I split up 27 and 95,4
teacher:Just one;student:One,4
teacher:30 times 60;student:30 and 60,4
teacher:Four which means Im going to have four combinations;student:Four,4
teacher:Two times two you remember;student:Two times two,4
teacher:nan;student:Pull them apart 60 and two,4
teacher:Yeah;student:Yes,4
teacher:Two factors make a product;student:Two factors,4
teacher:Okay so were taking two digits two twodigit numbers and were wrestling them together;student:and you put on the 10s on the ones and then the 10 wrestles all the other numbers and the one wrestles,4
teacher:That was one team or one wrestling guy;student:One,4
teacher:Seven times eight is 56;student:It shows seven times eight,4
teacher:Five good,4
teacher:One zero;student:One,4
teacher:A zero;student:One zero,4
teacher:Start by doing four times two;student:You add four times two and then when youre done with that you add the zeros,4
teacher:Multiplication with multi digit numbers,4
teacher:You think 12,4
teacher:Ooh eight times seven we know that one;student:Eight times seven,4
teacher:Okay you did it by seven counter marks you said 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14;student:I counted by seven,4
teacher:And seven thirteenths right;student:In exactly 13 days you burn  329 and seven thirteenths,4
teacher:Trade yes;student:Trade,4
teacher:Well not in one day but 13 days;student:Im not thinking in one day,4
teacher:It mattered that I had three people and I had to cut the pizza into thirds,4
teacher:You knew that you need to divide six cards by two,4
teacher:Excellent 9281000;student:Um9281000,4
teacher:So you did 50 times 8;student:I didnt really know what to do so I did like 50 times 8,4
teacher:You used graph paper;student:I used graph paper,4
teacher:So youre not getting the adding part;student:Im not really getting the like adding,4
teacher:So eight twenty four;student:Because its closer to that value,4
teacher:And I told you my hopes is that you are able to use US traditional multiplication and have a way to check it;student:Great job,4
teacher:My goal and your goal to be successful;student:Nine twenty five sorry,4
teacher:Nate;student:Now what is five times three,4
teacher:Three or thirty;student:The three,4
teacher:It does make a bowtie,4
teacher:The ones place by both digits;student:The ones place,4
teacher:I have to add a zero excellent;student:You have to add a zero to the place value,4
teacher:No because it really is just one 10  Yeah but that was to make it  You are right that would be 2000;student:Is it that 2 is supposed to be 2000 instead of 200,4
teacher:You got the area youve got the area model you just dont trust in yourself;student:I said  area,4
teacher:This is partial products;student:Is that partial sums or,4
teacher:Oh 240,4
teacher:No its 240;student:No,4
teacher:I love that Tom said I knew that I needed to multiply 20 times 4 but really 20 times 4 is only really just 4 times 2,4
teacher:and she put it in the tens place;student:And I just put it in the tens place,4
teacher:grow and learn;student:Grow,4
teacher:Nope not yet;student:No,4
teacher:So you disagree;student:Um no,4
teacher:Oh 900,4
teacher:So now youll agreeokay;student:So yeah now I agree,4
teacher:Okay you could do circles or you could do cans;student:circles,4
teacher:It mattered that I had three people and I had to cut the pizza into thirds,4
teacher:You knew that you need to divide six cards by two,4
teacher:Okay so the process okay;student:Im struggling all the steps in the process,4
teacher:Three times Okay so three times 20 is 60,4
teacher:Okay so you knew that 63 was a multiple of seven;student:Then I added this the side numbers,4
teacher:We did notSo we could do 30 plus 10;student:Did we already use 30 10,4
teacher:Okay so in that instance I could come down here and do 30 plus six plus four;student:Four,4
teacher:Well if you can estimate it just do the estimate Just do the answer;student:Or can I just do the answer,4
teacher:I only need two get to a half;student:a half,4
teacher:Okay from seven to nine;student:That would be seven,4
teacher:You have to in order to make it right Maddy you have to turn it into an improper fraction;student:Do you have to turn it into an improper fraction,4
teacher:So now Im going to turn that one into a 20;student:One 20th,4
teacher:Yes a mixed number;student:mixed number,4
teacher:Im not sharing my screen;student:Youre not sharing your screen,4
teacher:Same already;student:same,4
teacher:No weve already multiplied Reese;student:The multiplying part,4
teacher:Okay so 700000ths is what it would be;student:Um is it I think its 710 1000ths,4
teacher:Okay so 4000ths because one times four equals 4000ths;student:Oh no its four,4
teacher:So Im doing four tenths times One 100ths;student:And that would equal,4
teacher:it would be in the four tenths;student:Um it would be in four tenths,4
teacher:Oh 47;student:Because its supposed to be 4700ths,4
teacher:they are smushed together;student:Um inaudible so that answers might have to be like smushed together,4
teacher:Oh three cans;student:three cans,4
teacher:So Im going to draw a pizza and Im going to split it into thirds,4
teacher:So now youll agreeokay;student:So yeah now I agree,4
teacher:Yeah youre going to get your whiteboards out and your dry erase markers;student:Wait  whiteboards out too,4
teacher:90 99 108;student:90 99,4
teacher:Nope;student:No,4
teacher:We were making square numbers;student:Square numbers,4
teacher:We were looking at arrays;student:We were doing arrays,4
teacher:Okay it has something to do with geometry;student:Its kind of like geometry,4
teacher:They divided;student:I think the reason why they have a remainder and why it could be weird it was because some people thought it was division,4
teacher:I mean I could look really good for 81 but I told you in the problem that Im,4
teacher:Yeah Id be turning nine;student:No youd be nine this year,4
teacher:Improper but;student:Improper,4
teacher:One half of a cup;student:One half,4
teacher:Threefourths of a teaspoon;student:Threefourths,4
teacher:Onefourth teaspoon;student:Teaspoon,4
teacher:four cups which means they have enough water;student:Four cups,4
teacher:Yes;student:Mmhmm,4
teacher:Two groups of three;student:Two,4
teacher:She did 38 five times;student:Well we can probably use five function so 5 x 38,4
teacher:Okay so here she goes 38;student:38,4
teacher:Diego says we need five cups of water;student:Five  cups of water,4
teacher:Nope;student:No,4
teacher:Okay so lets apply  that basic third grade math to this problem;student:I think it was so easy because its a bit basic its like third grade math,4
teacher:So you just know 4x3 so when you saw that you automatically knew what the answer was,4
teacher:So when you gave me that 112,4
teacher:This is multiplication;student:Multiplication,4
teacher:365 days in a year,4
teacher:So you were doing repeated addition with seven;student:So seven plus seven,4
teacher:You can leave your planners in there until were ready for them;student:Can we take our planners out,4
teacher:You were counting by five seven times;student:Five,4
teacher:You counted by twos;student:I counted by twos,4
teacher:Add or attach three zeros;student:Just add three zeros,4
teacher:Six times 1000;student:You could write the six and then underneath you could write 1000,4
teacher:Because it was to the power of nine;student:To the power of nine,4
teacher:Zero zero zero comma;student:Zero zero zero,4
teacher:One 10th less every single time;student:Wait and you want us to go one 10th less every time,4
teacher:So Im attaching those zeros,4
teacher:10 yes,4
teacher:One okay;student:One,4
teacher:10 times greater or bigger;student:10 times,4
teacher:Im attaching a zero;student:Attaching a zero,4
teacher:I have 100,4
teacher:I get zero;student:Zero,4
teacher:Im attaching a zero;student:Attaching,4
teacher:Three numbers;student:Does it have to be three digits again,4
teacher:10 times,4
teacher:So my area is 40;student:Five ten 15 25 30 35 40,4
teacher:You counted by fours;student:I counted by fours,4
teacher:Okay so you use your imagination to count back;student:And then I used my imagination to multiply the numbers,4
teacher:Okay so you did four groups of six and you said six plus six is 12;student:Two more groups of that is 24,4
teacher:Yeah;student:Yeah,4
teacher:Counting by tens was easier for you,4
teacher:You counted by tens;student:Count by tens,4
teacher:Counted by twos;student:Because it was a good number so I counted by twos,4
teacher:Yeah;student:Yep,4
teacher:Theyre diagonals;student:Theyre diagnal,4
teacher:70 not seven;student:Seven,4
teacher:Yeah diagonals bisect;student:That the diaginals bisect the angles,4
teacher:So Im going to write my 200 and then Im going to do 40 x 6 just like up here and thats 240 and now Im going to do 2 x 50;student:200,4
teacher:3 x 824 so itll be 240;student:240,4
teacher:This is actually your partial products without the rectangle;student:The partial product,4
teacher:30 and 6 x 8;student:30,4
teacher:They actually did 70 x 8;student:8 x 6,4
teacher:No so it would be different if it was like 24;student:No,4
teacher:A zero;student:20 has just a zero,4
teacher:We need three zeros so that would be 24000;student:24,4
teacher:48 and we have to have three zeros so it becomes 48000;student:48,4
teacher:I hear partitioned rectangles;student:Partitioned rectangles,4
teacher:100 thank you;student:100,4
teacher:Yes it didnt cost 200 so Im going to subtract;student:Yes,4
teacher:Yes at the top Im just going to write 60 minutes in case;student:How many minutes are in an hour,4
teacher:Is greater than or equals;student:If it was doing the amount of money they have it would be a hundred equals,4
teacher:Explain maybe how you got to that number;student:Maybe he could explain how he got their money and how they got that number,4
teacher:You did not;student:No,4
teacher:No 3x6 is 18 but thats only going to get me 9;student:Is nine,4
teacher:Im not multiplying anything there;student:Well because 4x28,4
teacher:In words and showing what your understanding of the numbers were;student:to write that in words,4
teacher:I cut a half from three;student:Cut a half,4
teacher:Thats what she did 100   10;student:The part of Mattys answer I dont agree with was you would do 100   110,4
teacher:Because its fundraising I love that;student:Because its funraising,4
teacher:Oh theres two 100 bills so you did 200126;student:Because theres two 100 bills,4
teacher:You re saying instead of saying three was 30;student:There s a 30 and a 30,4
teacher:Good it should be 30 x 20 and then this should be 30 x 8;student:Also that the three and the 20 should be 30 x 20,4
teacher:He said you could add up all the lengths which is two and all the widths and you get the perimeter,4
teacher:Owen said everything else is hundredths;student:Because thats easier because everything else is hundredths,4
teacher:You add the wholes then add the fractions;student:The ones are whole and the ones that read isnt whole it would be,4
teacher:He was saying if theres nineteenfifths heres one thats five,4
teacher:What youre saying is when you got these fivefifths that was the two wholes and then you added a few more pieces;student:For the two and threefifths I did five plus five for those two wholes I got 10 and I did threefifths  thirteenfifths and then I did one and onefifth so fivefifths plus onefifth and I got sixfifths and then I added those together to get nineteenfifths,4
teacher:You just went into fourths because you knew that was a whole,4
teacher:Right she had two wholes because were in fourths and so she go  fourths and then added another fourth and got nine fourths;student:She  two wholes,4
teacher:2 times four because there comes with four in there;student:200,4
teacher:Yes how much money should Mr Swanson take to the store to be sure he has enough for all the strings;student:How much money,4
teacher:Yes he wants to buy two sets of strings for each student;student:He wants to buy two sets of strings for each student,4
teacher:Yes thats really important to know how much they come in;student:They come in a set of four,4
teacher:Yes strings are 2 each;student:The strings are two each,4
teacher:He needs new strings for his 19 violin students,4
teacher:He looked at it and got really overwhelmed at this big problem so well break it into steps,4
teacher:I could take 60  6;student:Six,4
teacher:He said I could cut this part out;student:You would have to divide it from  You would have to cut that part out then add two together,4
teacher:Six and everybody look;student:Six,4
teacher:Yes actually not seven;student:Seven,4
teacher:10 yes;student:10,4
teacher:No Davids counting;student:I dont think I can ever stop counting on that like 507,4
teacher:Yes make sure the 9 is at the ones;student:I would also put the 9 at the ones,4
teacher:He had to figure out these other two sides he has two sides left and if Ive 18 I can do 9 and 9 or he divided by 2;student:Because he got 18 x 2 and we all know 18 is the product of 9 x 2,4
teacher:No because I dont know what the other sides are yet;student:No,4
teacher:He knew this is the perimeter and he knew one side;student:He knew that in the perimeter was 752 and to get the perimeter you have to add up all the sides to get the same length so if you add those,4
teacher:That they all have 28 theyre the same digits;student:That they all have 28,4
teacher:They did Its going to yes 10 is 0;student:We did 10,4
teacher:Its going to be greater than the second factor;student:Its going to be greater than,4
teacher:Its going to be less than the second factor;student:It will be less than because its,4
teacher:Buying multiple things at the store;student:Oh we said when youre buying multiple things at the store,4
teacher:Because anything multiplied by one is  Okay nice job;student:Why I disagree because I know 34 times one equals 34 that will be equal to,4
teacher:They are the same,4
teacher:The same;student:Its equal,4
teacher:two twos;student:God two halves,4
teacher:Nope thats one and a half;student:One and one half,4
teacher:3 times 2 and 7 times 2;student:I cancelled the 2,4
teacher:215;student:Two,4
teacher:Theyre equivalent,4
teacher:Right so then theyd give it in a language that the other person can understand;student:I think theyre like I guess your example like if Im saying a different language,4
teacher:Divided by three;student:Three,4
teacher:Not 15;student:15,4
teacher:Multiples of six;student:Multiples,4
teacher:Okay divide it in fourths;student:Fourths,4
teacher:Im looking at a 13 of a half;student:A half,4
teacher:23 because she ate 13 23;student:23,4
teacher:She ate 23 of the half;student:23 of the pizza,4
teacher:Were going to color one of the halves in pencil or in color;student:Were going to fold this into two halves and were going to color or pencil one of these halves,4
teacher:A whole bar;student:A whole,4
teacher:the taco fold;student:The taco way,4
teacher:Half of it;student:A half,4
teacher:Youre still working on yours;student:Were still working on ours,4
teacher:1615;student:That would be 1625,4
teacher:A field trip if Im doing it on that when Im thinking about table groups I have to think about how many people I want into groups;student:A field trip,4
teacher:Divide it;student:Divide,4
teacher:I love that you explained why you did equal groups,4
teacher:87 good job;student:I cant do 568 87,4
teacher:I will have more than youve got to think about this in terms of groups;student:More than the whole group,4
teacher:Its going to be the product will be less than the first factor,4
teacher:When Im multiplying two factors;student:What does it mean when the second factor,4
teacher:It would be greater than a great thumbs up;student:Well I said it was well that 24  1  24 and that I know  number after the decimal it would be greater,4
teacher:Well 910 and 910 are equal to one another;student:Yes its a smaller fraction than 910,4
teacher:bigger than closer to its more than a half;student:Bigger,4
teacher:if CIndy is 52 you are not 54,4
teacher:53 53 12 right 54 54 12 55 55 12 56 56 12 ohoh 57 57 12,4
teacher:52 12 were going to start and a 12;student:52 12,4
teacher:I shouldnt see 4 10 I should see inches;student:Im 4 10,4
teacher:60 and then youre going to measure your partner,4
teacher:I might have 7 34 so I dont know;student:7 34,4
teacher:No way;student:No,4
teacher:Or 12,4
teacher:Or 18,4
teacher:With 18 and then check with my multiplication;student:Numbered to 18,4
teacher:I have two pita breads not eight pita breads;student:Because you only have two pita breads,4
teacher:Because you know youd have a negative number;student:Because then youd have a negative number,4
teacher:Different parts okay;student:Different parts of it,4
teacher:Two cups split in half then they also did it in a numbered sentence and they said that two halves divided by one unit times two units equals four halves;student:Two cups split in half,4
teacher:The double shades yes;student:The double shaded fraction,4
teacher:All of your problems should be solved using multiplication;student:Multiply,4
teacher:Of means multiplication,4
teacher:5687 Great;student:Or 5687,4
teacher:Were going to divide 100 divided by 10;student:Youre going to have to divide 100 by 10,4
teacher:More than 23 is more than 12;student:More than,4
teacher:Its more than a 12,4
teacher:Yes it is;student:No,4
teacher:905 per hour;student:9,4
teacher:By 2 cents,4
teacher:Big increase;student:Increased,4
teacher:You did a very good job;student:we did very good,4
teacher:30 and the spread would also get multiplied by three but in that case I guess if you all got 10 our spread would be zero;student:30,4
teacher:Doubled it;student:Two,4
teacher:It was 20;student:20,4
teacher:It has to cross the hole;student:Does it have to cross the hole,4
teacher:I know it s your mistake;student:My mistake,4
teacher:Oh you can;student:Yes you can,4
teacher:It has to be high;student:High,4
teacher:Pythagorean Theorem so you would go 52  y2 82;student:The Pythagorean theorem,4
teacher:The top win;student:The top,4
teacher:Cancel out and in the long run youre just approaching negative;student:Cancel,4
teacher:This doesnt matter;student:No,4
teacher:It gets super tiny and close to zero but never gets there;student:Is it really equal to zero or is it like,4
teacher:What Paul is talking about about getting closer and closer and closer to something without ever getting there there is a Greek philosopher named Zeno,4
teacher:The diameter of the circle or the direct distance from the origin to that point;student:The diameter,4
teacher:Actually it would be a 25 chance actually;student:That sounds about right  50 chance to get it wrong,4
teacher:Thats  thats on the xaxis;student:On the xaxis,4
teacher:It shifted very nice,4
teacher:It is Thursday its all multiple choice;student:Is it multiple choice on Thursday,4
teacher:do this;student:Cant do that,4
teacher:I could take off the greatest common factor of the 2;student:Yes you take out the two,4
teacher:You cant quit;student:I quit,4
teacher:It wouldn t change those because it can t hit the  so it would only change this one so that would change that because it does hit zero;student:It would change those over there,4
teacher:Well there is a list of another 190 ones so its going to happen somewhere in between two ones and the average of two ones is one;student:Exactly one,4
teacher:So heres already 260 numbers the 300th number happens within the ones,4
teacher:If you dont have nice numbers you will need to stop at the calculations or if you went out all the way to the answer  calculator;student:Right now we dont have nice numbers,4
teacher:You should have an identity on your sheet that says cos2    1   sin2;student:1   cos2   would be 1 cos2,4
teacher:Yes and so just do something mathematically correct;student:Yes,4
teacher:Only plug it;student:Then Ill plug it to,4
teacher:Yes thats the cosine;student:Hes changed the cosine,4
teacher:Right there;student:There,4
teacher:90 minus beta 180 minus beta;student:90 minus beta,4
teacher:Outstanding performance in the field of trigonometry;student:Outstanding performance,4
teacher:Same X;student:X,4
teacher:No you cant cancel the threes,4
teacher:No its not one because its radical three over three;student:Just one,4
teacher:I will tell you everybody its not seven,4
teacher:I can substitute in right here and just say that this is R2R21;student:R2,4
teacher:A right triangle;student:Right triangle,4
teacher:X over R square both of those equals one;student:X over R,4
teacher:Yes tractor came up;student:Tractor came up,4
teacher:You just have to add the X1;student:Oh so you dont have to add that over here,4
teacher:He didnt teach you that;student:Okay so were all  and I think you werent here the other day but the other guy that taught us how to do it,4
teacher:This guy divided by this guy;student:To find what the possible  is always that guy over that one,4
teacher:What I would like you to do is just note that you checked it so say;student:On the test say you  and you got that do you have to go back and check it repetitively,4
teacher:Cross product;student:Multiply,4
teacher:Zero is where it hits zero so it s below zero from here back it s not below zero from here till;student:What zero,4
teacher:15 leftover so write 1615;student:15,4
teacher:Its a tie and when its a tie it does have a horizontal asymptote;student:Tie,4
teacher:Bottom wins;student:Bottom,4
teacher:What youre saying is you did 10 14  D is 11 and you knew that 14  34 gives you 1 to make 11;student:The first thing that I did was I did  then I did minus 10,4
teacher:Yes we added one and two of them so one had six and another one had six;student:I added one and two of them,4
teacher:Group of five so we drew out groups of five to show and model all the bags so each one of five;student:What we did is we brought out 95,4
teacher:If you do the length  the width you should get the area they gave you,4
teacher:Add so I have to figure out the burritos and sandwiches and add them together;student:Add,4
teacher:I see some friends saying Yes Im getting it now;student:Yes,4
teacher:I hear a yes;student:Yes,4
teacher:What youre saying is you did basically eight times three is 24 and you multiplied by 22;student:Then I started adding them up,4
teacher:Tell me what you multiplied for tumblers;student:I did the tumblers,4
teacher:What I see here is I see a really big multiplication problem;student:Then after I got all those I started adding them up so that I could get my answer which is 528,4
teacher:What youre saying is that you circled the information and you added those together and you got 78 for your answer;student:Then I had 78,4
teacher:I heard multiplication;student:I revisited another lesson on multiplication,4
teacher:Heres a right angle and its bigger,4
teacher:He went ahead and figured out what the angle was and he said its about a third of the circle,4
teacher:Very good and so you can have it like this where one is the 12 and one is the three;student:You could have the hour hand on the 6 or the 12 and the minute hand on the three,4
teacher:Very good its a right angle;student:Right angle,4
teacher:She said just because the size of them size Blooks bigger it doesnt mean the actual angle is bigger,4
teacher:14 or 28;student:14,4
teacher:No its just 28  12;student:124  18  18  18,4
teacher:Yes 124 isnt 12;student:It was not 12,4
teacher:Its blue,4
teacher:Yes the oldest one gets more than the two sisters;student:The oldest daughter gets more than the two sisters,4
teacher:12  14  14  1;student:Fourths,4
teacher:I see that  did a subtraction problem so unless if you had a subtraction problem thats exactly one 11 minus 10 and 14 okay you knew you dont have a model does someone in your group have the model to show or shift,4
teacher:Top when the top wins we know that it does not have a horizontal asymptote;student:Top,4
teacher:In the 20 to 30;student:The 20 to 30,4
teacher:No you just know it represents somewhere in the 30 to 40 range;student:No,4
teacher:2 and a 5 and theyre both positive to get to 7;student:5 2,4
teacher:x  6;student:Six,4
teacher:Like the thing in the middle of the road;student:The middle of the road,4
teacher:Fifty kid goes in this one;student:Fifty to sixty,4
teacher:Yes so Im going to make a bar that goes up to one and Im just going to stack that;student:One,4
teacher:Histograms are hard to see sometimes so watch;student:I cant see,4
teacher:I counted by tens;student:Tens,4
teacher:I made the boxes big so you can have room to take your notes;student:Why you made the boxes big this time,4
teacher:I would make a histogram;student:A histogram,4
teacher:A big list of data;student:Data,4
teacher:This one starts at 0;student:They both,4
teacher:I think I know it when you say the histograms are not exactly all the numbers,4
teacher:The height of the bar shows the data;student:Yes  obvious,4
teacher:Okay so lets say that they both have numbers on the yaxis;student:Y,4
teacher:Okay they have an x and a yaxis;student:They have an x and yaxis,4
teacher:On there;student:On the bar graph,4
teacher:Bar graph okay;student:Bar graph,4
teacher:The data is more condensed this year than last year;student:We said that the data was more condensed this year than last year,4
teacher:This is Kate;student:Kate,4
teacher:Probably not;student:No,4
teacher:You said last years class has a bigger outlier than this years;student:I said last years class has a bigger outlier than this years,4
teacher:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9;student:Nine,4
teacher:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9;student:Theres nine spaces,4
teacher:It goes in the 30 to 40;student:30 to 40,4
teacher:Of 25;student:We first write down 81 and then its 25,4
teacher:So you multiplied 2 by 15;student:I multiplied 2x15 as well to get the 25,4
teacher:25 of 31 so write 25 of 31 under the whiteboard or under the dark camera;student:25 of 31,4
teacher:I want three;student:Three,4
teacher:This tells me how many pieces are in the whole thing this tells me how many I ate we dont need to mess with the denominator we only need to add the numerator as long as our denominators are the same;student:Its how many,4
teacher:We do to the top and we do everything Miss Calice says;student:We do to the top,4
teacher:Xavier says 28 is the same as 14;student:28,4
teacher:You will say it as 14;student:I will say it in a different way 14,4
teacher:We have two pieces of a fraction;student:Parts of a whole,4
teacher:I get 8100;student:Eight,4
teacher:So in that one all of my piece sizes are the same but the number of pieces I get is near that;student:What I notice is that the denominator is the same but the numerator are not,4
teacher:Because 52 is a bit more than a half,4
teacher:I ate less than half of the pizza;student:Less,4
teacher:So Xavier  Xavier and his table believe that this is the largest 1112 because youre eating all but one piece;student:Because almost all the pizzas you just have one more left,4
teacher:None of the numerators are the same none of the denominators are the same;student:None of the numerators are the same and none of the denominators,4
teacher:120 I only get one slice out of 20;student:120,4
teacher:So you just focused strictly on denominators and said Im going to start with the biggest and Im going to go to the next biggest to the next biggest to the next biggest;student:I made it like the denominator that was the biggest number to the smallest number,4
teacher:The numerators are all the same;student:The numerator,4
teacher:Getting the same number of pieces but these pieces are bigger;student:It has nine so the pieces should be bigger,4
teacher:No theyre not;student:No,4
teacher:25 I want to have a common denominator,4
teacher:I want to make an equivalent fraction;student:A fraction thats equivalent,4
teacher:Whatever I do to the top I do to the bottom;student:Whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom,4
teacher:Is greater than 25;student:55 are greater than 25,4
teacher:25 is less than 55;student:Less than 55,4
teacher:Just because this number is big doesnt mean those pieces are big;student:The bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces,4
teacher:Haley thinks weve covered the whole thing so if we add those fractions together we would get one whole;student:They both cover one piece of the whole one side of the whole,4
teacher:Youre telling me that the slices over here are bigger;student:Because 17 the pieces are smaller and on 13 one piece is bigger than the one piece of 17,4
teacher:Four of them;student:Four,4
teacher:I need to have a common denominator I need to find a number that I can change both of these two;student:denominator to another number,4
teacher:Four of them;student:Four,4
teacher:12 divided by 3 equals 4;student:4 3s equals 12 so 3 divided by 12 equals 4,4
teacher:Multiplication we might be adding groups of something;student:Multiplication,4
teacher:when you divide were separating into groups;student:When you divide you separate it into groups,4
teacher:You do have to think about it;student:We have to think about it,4
teacher:We dont change the denominator;student:Did one 1  5 and it led me to five then I add 5 5 and then we get we dont change the denominator,4
teacher:by a fifth;student:25  55 I mean 56,4
teacher:I have to have common denominators in order to add;student:First you have to have similar denominators for those two,4
teacher:Were going to add or subtract our numerators;student:Our numerators,4
teacher:We have to change one of them;student:You have to change one of them,4
teacher:We might not have to change it so I think our first step is to check our denominators,4
teacher:Denominators have to be the same;student:The denominator,4
teacher:Can I have some people that changed the hundredth but didnt change the numerator;student:They didnt make the 110 into ten hundredths,4
teacher:Yes page 170;student:Were not doing page 170,4
teacher:A teaspoon;student:Teaspoon,4
teacher:Were talking the whole as an inch;student:Inches,4
teacher:Theres 58 of a pizza left over;student:Theres 58 of the pizzas left,4
teacher:Yes we only add the numerator;student:Yes,4
teacher:We could make our denominators eight change your fractions so that all of your denominators have eight;student:They all have eight,4
teacher:You said the oldest girl gets two pieces and the youngest girls each get one;student:One for the  the other for the other little girl and then two for the big girls,4
teacher:So we really dont want the yellow because the yellow you traded in for two blues;student:But then we had a pink and  the youngest gave two of the blues on top of the yellow,4
teacher:Okay look at this if I have two yellow parts;student:No I had two,4
teacher:She can so youre working on it right now proving with pictures and numbers;student:She can,4
teacher:Its pictures with labels showing you exactly where things are or what it is or who it belongs to;student:Its somewhere where it tells you where it say  almost like a diagram  where it shows you where the nose or the  something where it is,4
teacher:Right skip counting or repeated subtraction or we could put pieces into groups;student:Skip counting,4
teacher:One piece;student:One,4
teacher:We were doing some stuff with equivalent fractions yes;student:We did about equivalent fractions,4
teacher:Two the pizza Jeremiah is cut into two slices;student:Two,4
teacher:I see what youre saying Tessa says were not going to add these numbers were only going to add the top numbers;student:Its because if you equal both of them like the bottom and the top it will be whole it will be four and two so thats why we dont add the bottom number twice,4
teacher:Two so thats going to be my denominator my denominator is two because I look I see two pieces;student:Two,4
teacher:No totally good;student:No,4
teacher:Its a whole so we could call this one whole;student:Its a whole,4
teacher:Its a full one,4
teacher:5 and 23 yards;student:5 and 23,4
teacher:What Eileen did it sounds like Paula explained is that she took the extra two that was left over and split it between the three boxes 23;student:The denominator is 13,4
teacher:You go to 15 or 18,4
teacher:I hear Eileen saying that you cant just split You cant count by threes and get to 17;student:You can only count to 15 or 18,4
teacher:Yes three is the denominator;student:Because three is the denominator,4
teacher:Awesome 6 or 14;student:6 which is also equal to 14,4
teacher:I hear Eileen saying that 18 is 34 of the roses and that is how many roses are red;student:We could use 18 since its underneath the third box as a representation that 18 is 34 of the roses,4
teacher:Yes in the fraction and Eileen went ahead and circled it the denominator is four;student:Because 34 on the bottom the denominator is four,4
teacher:You drew a tape diagram to show 24;student:24 so,4
teacher:Two dozen equals 24,4
teacher:7 x 3  21,4
teacher:What I see she wrote on her desk is Oops  355  7,4
teacher:I didnt write on the board what 35;student:Because you dont have You didnt write on the board what 35 of 35 is,4
teacher:We know that 7 x 5  35,4
teacher:Lindsay says 7;student:7,4
teacher:said Because if you skip count by fives you can reach 35;student:Because if you skip count by fives you can reach 35,4
teacher:58 theyre all the same,4
teacher:Orange yes lets look at the orange;student:Orange,4
teacher:The equal too;student:The equal sign,4
teacher:My denominator is going to be three;student:Denominator,4
teacher:Four so lets give this a denominator of four;student:Four,4
teacher:We were comparing fractions;student:We did about to compare fractions,4
teacher:we do as half;student:We do to the top,4
teacher:nothing;student:Zero,4
teacher:Zero out of seven;student:Zero sevenths,4
teacher:I get nothing;student:Zero,4
teacher:One time four;student:One times four,4
teacher:We could multiply it times two so we could either add three or multiply by two;student:You could multiply it times two,4
teacher:Three so three ninths is going to be another equivalent fraction;student:Three,4
teacher:Divided by three 12 divided by three tells me four slices;student:No divide by three,4
teacher:Yes I can divide those six pieces by three;student:You just need put them like three and three and just give them to each one,4
teacher:Six divided by three gives me two;student:Two,4
teacher:We have four twelfths;student:12,4
teacher:Lets try,4
teacher:Youre saying if I put these two together these are going to be equal,4
teacher:Six because six is half of 12;student:Six,4
teacher:Two four six eight;student:They are all like the four is divided by two,4
teacher:He said that theyre all equivalent to one half;student:Theyre all equivalent to one half,4
teacher:The numerators we actually have one two three four five;student:The numerator is one two three four five,4
teacher:Lets check dark blue;student:Dark blue,4
teacher:You want to eat three sixths Maya says lets eat three of them;student:Three sixths,4
teacher:Each slice of this pizza is worth one sixth,4
teacher:I think so;student:Yes,4
teacher:Three out of the four slices;student:Three out of four,4
teacher:Two so the three comes from the number of slices in the whole pizza the two comes from the number of pieces we ate I ate I guess;student:Two,4
teacher:Oh its C,4
teacher:That we have to add;student:Add,4
teacher:Okay so theyre challenging for some people;student:I like a challenge,4
teacher:They added this first;student:so we did 01 and then 89 and then 42 and then,4
teacher:Nine and seven are wholes;student:Nine and seven,4
teacher:Because 9  7 is 16,4
teacher:Okay add that zero for me;student:Zero,4
teacher:Yes there we go that s made it a one whole with a 10 plus you are absolutely 100 percent correct;student:Yes,4
teacher:12 and five tenths;student:12 to five tenths,4
teacher:I dont get this yet,4
teacher:We can adapt and change in order to be able to align my words in the game of scrabble I had to find a word that had the A in the exact place that was that I could build off of it,4
teacher:I love that you used the word column;student:Were going to say columned,4
teacher:Yes so millions would not come for a while;student:Millions,4
teacher:Tens and hundredths so there are two numbers its going to be read as 49 hundredths;student:Hundreds,4
teacher:So write 49 hundredths good job;student:Two  49 hundredths,4
teacher:You would write that two;student:Two,4
teacher:The value the place values;student:Place value,4
teacher:Yes we did;student:Yes,4
teacher:We have a seven;student:A seven,4
teacher:Count how many cubes are left;student:You can count how many longs and then how many cubes,4
teacher:Two longs;student:Two,4
teacher:Three is subtraction;student:Three,4
teacher:Am I hearing you say that you did 190220 and thats how you got your estimate;student:Bruce erased it but we knew that 194 we knew that the rule is four less all of the rest so this would just be 190 and then we knew that five is more or less the score so we raised the one and two and then itll be 220,4
teacher:Two you are only doing problem number two right now;student:Two and three,4
teacher:You have to change it;student:When I do my homework at my house and my dad tells me its wrong but I think its right so we change it,4
teacher:Thats not revising thats doing;student:I revise by doing my chores and book,4
teacher:Oh that is a four sorry;student:That one is a four,4
teacher:The stores revise their pricing excellent job;student:Because if you work there and say it over to pricing and its like last Friday or something you bring that thing down,4
teacher:Improper fraction Thats okay;student:Improper fraction,4
teacher:No it is impossible;student:No,4
teacher:12 3 and then times it by that;student:To get that and then multiply that and I get the answer,4
teacher:Great job Asher I wanted to hear you say I could divide,4
teacher:Im dividing my in by the denominator;student:The denominator,4
teacher:A whole;student:Whole,4
teacher:The top one from the bottom one language;student:We didnt subtract I dont remember the numbers we didnt subtract them the top one from the bottom one so we had to,4
teacher:Sixsixths exactly;student:sixsixths,4
teacher:and threesixths;student:Threesixths,4
teacher:You subtracted it okay;student:We thought that this 910 was close to 1 and then 810 was a little close to 1 and then 11 is closer to 0,4
teacher:You did make it 43;student:I made it 43,4
teacher:She took one whole;student:One whole,4
teacher:So you had to take a little bit from the three;student:On the second one you can subtract 31 but you cant subtract 1323 because theyre smaller so I had to take a little bit from the whole and then I turn the whole into two and then put the rest on the fractions and then I got 43,4
teacher:The numerators;student:The numerator,4
teacher:So youre saying the answers are what is different oaky;student:The answers of one and two are bigger,4
teacher:Okay so they both have the same denominator;student:The one with fractions they both have the same denominator for each problem,4
teacher:No weve already got a common denominator;student:A common denominator,4
teacher:I dont want your common denominator;student:My common denominator is 15,4
teacher:I cant add;student:Add,4
teacher:48 is my half;student:is a half,4
teacher:7 and 216 there you go;student:Then two wholes plus five wholes equals seven wholes so 7 and 216,4
teacher:He said its a little less than four;student:45 and 23 is pretty close to four,4
teacher:It was yes two and onethird;student:Two and one third,4
teacher:The multiples of the numbers;student:I think  multiples of the numbers,4
teacher:The denominators very good;student:The denominators,4
teacher:A whole number and a fraction;student:A mixed number is where you have a fraction and a whole,4
teacher:Yes  turnaround facts;student:Yes,4
teacher:Okay we discussed student A B and Cs work and then we looked at ours;student:We discussed student A B and Cs work,4
teacher:Its going to be wider okay;student:Its going to be wider,4
teacher:You could also divide that might get that too;student:We could also divide them,4
teacher:Okay go ahead 32;student:32,4
teacher:Improper fractions;student:Improper,4
teacher:Leaving it but were using the original pair;student:Youre just leaving it,4
teacher:X coordinate;student:Eight is X,4
teacher:The X coordinate;student:The X,4
teacher:Adding them doesnt do anything;student:Adding doesnt do anything,4
teacher:It should be bigger yes;student:It should be bigger,4
teacher:Double or 11 is two;student:Two,4
teacher:No it is not;student:No,4
teacher:Exactly so youre closing the shape;student:That means you have to close the shape,4
teacher:Go back to it so you go to it once then when it reoccurs again in the order you connect the next plot point to it;student:Go back to it,4
teacher:So Judith is going with 610;student:Six,4
teacher:Our numerator;student:Numerator,4
teacher:Emmanuel is saying lets just add this five for your numerator,4
teacher:18 18 18 please dont break my basket,4
teacher:Five batches,4
teacher:She needs six;student:Six,4
teacher:Three plus three because we need two threes;student:Three plus three,4
teacher:For one batch;student:Batch,4
teacher:Okay you said add;student:Because there is three vases and they want to know that we know that theres four and basically theyre saying how many flowers are in these all and we have to add  times four,4
teacher:3 so I could write a 3 in that line;student:3,4
teacher:Okay so you got rid of Sorry you did these two;student:I went to that 30 one,4
teacher:Okay thats where your eight I just needed clarification;student:I took the third minus 11 then I knew that it was eight,4
teacher:You needed to make it smaller;student:That we needed to make it smaller,4
teacher:Okay extrapolate is to estimate an unknown value beyond known values and continuing the graph following the pattern;student:Extrapolate,4
teacher:Some do but one doesnt okay;student:Well some do but one doesnt,4
teacher:Six times you just said were making it six times;student:12 and then 0 and then 0x6 so 0,4
teacher:It doesnt go to 40 so I have to think about what Im using before I do it;student:Because the house number it goes to is four or the coordinates that you have to meet is four so you have to do 410 and thatll be 40 and it doesnt go up to 40,4
teacher:Okay so you followed the rule;student:We followed the rule we just didnt get is as,4
teacher:Im hearing he doubled the wide coordinates he maybe didnt understand it,4
teacher:Right so he said if he did that his book would only be taller;student:He timesed it by six to make it bigger both ways instead of it being taller because he started going too taller but then its a normalsized book because he timesed it by six,4
teacher:Itd be in the corner;student:The corner,4
teacher:You disagreed;student:I disagreed,4
teacher:Yes to change;student:To restart or change,4
teacher:No its called a diagram but thats not;student:A diagram,4
teacher:Okay so lets see what it would be at 16;student:Multiply it by four that would be 16,4
teacher:Twice as wide twice as tall those are the words you should be using in your explanation;student:Tall,4
teacher:Jake can double;student:You can double,4
teacher:Jake can but I need to know what Jake needs to do;student:Jake can use and then we were thinking Jake can use blank as his rule but thats like a sentence,4
teacher:Change both coordinates okay;student:Change the Y coordinates,4
teacher:Okay so then it would be no because I thought it would be bigger;student:No its just wider,4
teacher:Yes go get a straight edge because youre going to want to connect it that way;student:Do we need a straight edge,4
teacher:Its bigger than there you go;student:It means its bigger than that,4
teacher:The order in which you do things exactly;student:Like an order,4
teacher:Bigger very good;student:Bigger,4
teacher:Thats much better 055;student:055,4
teacher:Then graph 14,4
teacher:12 x 2 is 24,4
teacher:I would like you to connect the points because we always connect our points;student:Do you want us to connect the points,4
teacher:A data table very good;student:It is a data table,4
teacher:Thats 5;student:Five,4
teacher:Connect them in order because if I start down here my shape is not going to work;student:Connect them in order,4
teacher:Thats 8;student:Eight,4
teacher:I like that you didnt just say one and 12 because thats whats left over,4
teacher:12 okay;student:12,4
teacher:Yeah this is a tape diagram;student:This is a tape diagram,4
teacher:Yeah the threes cancel out;student:The threes cancel out technically,4
teacher:This lets us know that 58 would fit into three and 48 five and 35 times,4
teacher:Four is not a common denominator;student:Four,4
teacher:It would be twothirds;student:Would that be twothirds,4
teacher:The gaps are just there to show you the difference between one part two parts three parts four parts five parts;student:Theyre just there,4
teacher:You agree;student:I agree,4
teacher:Yeah it took up exactly half of each one of the parts;student:And each of them have two in it and if you put that one block on one of the four so theres that would be four wholes and onehalf because you took a part of it off so theres only one,4
teacher:I see youre thinking like you have 34 here;student:I think its 34 because if you have if two would be another 12 of four and then if you divide them all into fourths theres one two 34 of 12,4
teacher:Because youre right that its onefourth of a whole but it is one third of the size of the piece that we are dividing things into;student:Why wouldnt it be onefourth,4
teacher:So youre proposing that this little piece is onethird of a part,4
teacher:Its going to be the answer is going to be an exact number;student:Or is does it have to be exact,4
teacher:You need three on both sides for six,4
teacher:Youre going to have to write so many number sentences;student:Will we have to write a number sentence on the test,4
teacher:And crew since its multiplication we can do 56 time 7 or 7 times 56;student:Couldnt you do 7 times 56,4
teacher:3 and 34,4
teacher:Youre right 4 would go into this to get to 12;student:12 and,4
teacher:Yeah so 4 will go into 36 nine times;student:Im just confused on how that equals the 9,4
teacher:We will talk about division later;student:Okay and then is it the Finleye for division,4
teacher:It would be 200;student:Wouldnt that be 200,4
teacher:Yeah if I lifted it up it would fit in here one two three times;student:It could fit in all three of them,4
teacher:Okay so one two three four five six seven eight;student:Then you would have eighths,4
teacher:Yeah 68 divided by groups that are the size of 18;student:It would be 68,4
teacher:Six divided by one,4
teacher:Good job 50 ounces,4
teacher:Yeah Im going to multiply by five;student:Five,4
teacher:One half so Im going to take half of one and do one half;student:One half,4
teacher:Yeah because Im going to take half of 10 and thats going to give me five;student:Five,4
teacher:Two cups you got it;student:Two cups,4
teacher:20 ounces you got it;student:20 ounces,4
teacher:Yes;student:Yeah,4
teacher:Yeah four things;student:Four things,4
teacher:Yeah to three cups;student:Three cups,4
teacher:Yours was similar to Estellas in that you both saw nine,4
teacher:Im actually going to write this that you saw something that was three by three,4
teacher:B yeah;student:B,4
teacher:The only other thing I would add is that one fourth fits into two and three fourths 11 times,4
teacher:Its 18;student:So its not 18,4
teacher:Its not one third;student:Um is it one third,4
teacher:Seven eighths divided up into groups that are the size of two eighths,4
teacher:A quarter of a pound youre exactly right;student:A quarter pound,4
teacher:Two groups of four;student:four equals eight,4
teacher:You are correct at 16,4
teacher:Yeah because you see youre putting them into groups of two;student:I thought it would be nine times three because its 2 and then divided by two,4
teacher:Yeah so 27 divided by three or just which is nine;student:Do we just count this as one so this would just be 27,4
teacher:Were going to divide it into groups that are the size of 23,4
teacher:You can find your common denominator;student:Find a common denominator,4
teacher:No because when we use an area model notice how we set it up we put up the 35 into 30 and 5;student:Am I allowed to do 35x42,4
teacher:1200 sounds good,4
teacher:The lowest common multiple yep;student:So basically so youre finding the lowest common factor of both numbers,4
teacher:So eight times three is 24 and then nine times three oh sorry,4
teacher:24 you got it;student:24,4
teacher:200 youre right;student:That would be 200,4
teacher:So in order to find 10 if I go back to our warmup here where we were finding 10 thats one tenth,4
teacher:So Joannas was short and sweet she said 50 means half so just divide by two,4
teacher:Yeah just like Nash said and Leslie said that half of a hundred is 50;student:So is it since its half that means its 50,4
teacher:Yup its divided into fourths you got it;student:Four,4
teacher:Yeah so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10;student:Ten goes into 100 ten times you also do 1 x 10,4
teacher:Yeah because 50 is half of a hundred;student:I agree that 50 is equivalent to one half of 100,4
teacher:So Nash Alfie just said that he thinks 50 is equivalent to one half;student:I think its equivalent to one half,4
teacher:If you think about it in quarters one quarter is 25 two quarters is 50 three quarters would be 75,4
teacher:So Kathleen Bill just said that he thinks 75 is equivalent to three fourths,4
teacher:Its also one quarter or one fourth;student:25 is also one quarter,4
teacher:Percent is a root word that means per 100,4
teacher:You could do one over ten or one tenth;student:You could do one over 10,4
teacher:So you did times three,4
teacher:So thats our whole 15  2 is 17,4
teacher:You have parts that are adding up to one whole;student:Maybe because theres numbers that are adding up to one,4
teacher:Well they actually change by 125 because every time we add an 18 we add 125;student:I think you add 200 each time,4
teacher:Its not 550;student:550,4
teacher:So every time we add an 18 we add 125,4
teacher:Its going to be 375,4
teacher:So if we look at our previous page over here we did 18 here;student:Okay so I think the 18 would be I think it would be 01 for that one,4
teacher:Yeah 6 repeating;student:Repeating,4
teacher:Three would work if were finding one third;student:You could divide by three,4
teacher:15 cups yeah,4
teacher:Which is 25 mmhmm;student:25,4
teacher:75 you got it;student:That would be 75,4
teacher:Okay now 1924 is just a fraction its not an improper fraction so we dont have to change anything with it,4
teacher:Cool 24,4
teacher:Yeah I can hear you;student:Can you hear me,4
teacher:Okay so 5740 right here using our bullets;student:So I get everything else Im just confused of once you have 12 and 57 how that goes to 12 plus 17 over 40,4
teacher:Yeah you can say 13 and 1740;student:And that would be 13 and,4
teacher:So wed have 12 plus one and 1740;student:And then I did 57 minus 40 to get my answer and I got 17,4
teacher:Yeah by 55 yeah five over five;student:By five,4
teacher:Yeah so lets multiply the numerator and the denominator by eight;student:Eight,4
teacher:So Id have one and 918 so that would be 10 Oh sorry let me go back Im adding wrong,4
teacher:Yeah 27 and were going to say 2718;student:So that would be 27,4
teacher:So Im going to multiply the numerator and the denominator by six,4
teacher:Lets do 18,4
teacher:Because we have 13 and then 16 is the same as one and 115,4
teacher:Lets do it lets do 15;student:15,4
teacher:Okay so if we have 16 plus 38 lets see what it would be;student:16 and 38,4
teacher:Lets eliminate 34 because its already more than one half;student:34,4
teacher:Youre right Mack 48 is exactly one half but were going to combine cards whos sum is closest to one half but youre right 48 is exactly one half good job using your mental math strategy;student:Cross out 48 if it sums out to be one half,4
teacher:Well we might add 110 to something later;student:110 because its definitely too little,4
teacher:48 because is already one half yeah lets delete that one;student:Possibly 48 because its already half,4
teacher:I love it 910 because it already exceeds what we need;student:Yeah 910 because it exceeds what we need,4
teacher:110 and 16 that seems to do a really good job of following their strategy low numerator high denominator;student:I would pick 110 and 16,4
teacher:It would be 90 youre right;student:That would be 90,4
teacher:Nash Im so glad you asked that question the question isnt asking what is 50 of 9 thats the question you answered;student:T half of 9 wouldnt it be 45,4
teacher:Okay so divide the first number you get by four because thats going to give you 25;student:Divide the first number by four,4
teacher:Yep lets divide the first column by five;student:The first five,4
teacher:One fifth mmhmm  because one fifth plus one fifth plus one fifth plus one fifth plus one fifth is one;student:So just one fifth,4
teacher:Yeah there is six ounces of tuna;student:Oh the six ounce can of tuna,4
teacher:corresponding angles they are congruent;student:Theyre congruent,4
teacher:Yeah check it and we need to make sure that this plus this equals 180;student:Check it,4
teacher:Not the same;student:No,4
teacher:Same side same side interior;student:Same side interior,4
teacher:Not parallel;student:That theyre parallel,4
teacher:corresponding Thanks Patrick;student:corresponding,4
teacher:You got to check it;student:Check it,4
teacher:Okay so 3x plus two y plus three y minus x equals 180,4
teacher:So 3x minus y plus nine,4
teacher:Yeah were gonna add x add x add x you get 3x equals 90 divide by three divide by 3 x equals 30;student:inaudible 3x minus 90,4
teacher:These make a 180;student:47 minus x equals 180,4
teacher:Subtract 76 from 180;student:subtract 76,4
teacher:Yeah 180 they make a linear pair they make a straight line;student:180,4
teacher:reverse angles Very close,4
teacher:SHP perfect;student:shp,4
teacher:the end points in the middle so Im going to underline the X;student:the end points in the middle,4
teacher:he Okay;student:He,4
teacher:Yep F and K would work as well;student:f and K,4
teacher:b h definitely makes a straight line;student:Sorry B and H and F and k,4
teacher:BCHK,4
teacher:So KHCE you want three points in a straight line and then one other point,4
teacher:bch perfect;student:bch,4
teacher:KCF totally works;student:I said kcf,4
teacher:take away x that would be a better choice in this one;student:Take away x,4
teacher:Yeah its gonna be negative;student:Negative 18,4
teacher:So I would say if it unless it has the the right angle symbol,4
teacher:They are going to equal 180;student:They equal 180,4
teacher:rhombus super close;student:Its a rhombus,4
teacher:Thats 4;student:Four,4
teacher:yeah 90 degree angles;student:90 degree angle,4
teacher:yep;student:Yes,4
teacher:Yeah its a parallelogram;student:Yes,4
teacher:opposite angles are congruent;student:Opposite angles inauidble,4
teacher:minus nine you want to usually take away the smaller one,4
teacher:divided by five;student:Five,4
teacher:vertical angles and theyre right angles;student:Theyre verticle,4
teacher:It works on this one I guess;student:So it works,4
teacher:O matches up with M This ones a little weird cuz you got to flip the last one;student:N M,4
teacher:HIG okay;student:HIG,4
teacher:Yeah we have vertical angles lets label them;student:well yeah because we have the vertical angle,4
teacher:no theyre not labeled;student:no,4
teacher:F its in between purple and yellow;student:F,4
teacher:E A is in between blue and yellow;student:E,4
teacher:C and F match up,4
teacher:E Okay;student:E,4
teacher:so if you go ACB that would be congruent;student:so ACB And DEF,4
teacher:C theyre in the same spot;student:C,4
teacher:so segment IG is congruent to segment AT,4
teacher:IG and AT Yes;student:IG and AT,4
teacher:C okay so that means what Im labeling my triangles and these triangles arent very good;student:C,4
teacher:Equal inaudible when we put them together;student:Equlity,4
teacher:Yeah so on the previous page if you guys remember we just worked through what 16 is equivalent to and it was 16 repeating;student:It would be 16,4
teacher:So lets see what happens when we plug in x equals negative seven and see if it makes sense in this problem,4
teacher:yeah were gonna combine the like terms by adding them together;student:Oh add them,4
teacher:Its not minutes;student:Minutes,4
teacher:Its not feet;student:Feet,4
teacher:It is not measured in kilometers;student:Is it measured in kilometers,4
teacher:Thats exactly what it is how many steps they take in a certain amount of time;student:So its like a ratio how many steps they take in a certain amount of time,4
teacher:It is their pace;student:I think its pace because I see,4
teacher:Its not heart rate,4
teacher:Well not the same speed but I would guess that it might be how hard it is the same difficulty level,4
teacher:Theyre on the same level;student:Theyre using the same level,4
teacher:So Jada exercised for 30 minutes and Dallas  exercised for 24 minutes,4
teacher:For exercise;student:Exercise,4
teacher:So crew I want you to add to your I Can statement specifically the word ratio tables because youve gotten really good at these and today youre going to see some opportunities where they are very helpful in allowing us to compare things,4
teacher:So Im going to save three cups last,4
teacher:So Im going to write 10,4
teacher:I think theres cheese;student:Cheese,4
teacher:Yeah that its equal;student:Equal to,4
teacher:Like seven;student:I could like it could be a,4
teacher:Two in six times eight;student:Six and eight,4
teacher:Six times nine,4
teacher:So then you knew that there would be another group of three times three,4
teacher:I got that this is nine and nine and thats 18 together,4
teacher:When you can divide both of the numbers by the same number yeah;student:When you can divide both of the numbers by the same number,4
teacher:Yeah so Im going to multiply by three which is going to give me three;student:By three,4
teacher:Well could say if this is a three to six ratio we could also say its a one to two ratio;student:Would you do three cups pasta and two ounces of tuna,4
teacher:This is miles per hour;student:Miles per hour,4
teacher:14 and two okay;student:14 and 2,4
teacher:So were going to say minutes and miles,4
teacher:Yeah that eight minutes to the 10;student:I put  eight minutes to the 10,4
teacher:two and six okay;student:2 and 6,4
teacher:thats gonna be 82;student:82,4
teacher:Yeah so its 41;student:Theyre equal So its 41,4
teacher:Yeah were gonna plug in eight for x,4
teacher:And were going to do that on both sides;student:plus seven from the 6x,4
teacher:so lets divide them both by three;student:three,4
teacher:Yeah we labeled them like x one y one;student:the x and the y,4
teacher:Yeah its slope and y intercept;student:Is it the slope and the y intercept,4
teacher:And you can just write it as two,4
teacher:You just need to simplify the minus 10 over five part,4
teacher:Click that question help button;student:Click the Help button,4
teacher:Yeah go to advisory;student:Go to advisory,4
teacher:So it is a function,4
teacher:Yeah the x values always a two;student:the x axis is always at two,4
teacher:Yeah they all have a three four;student:They have a three,4
teacher:Yeah were putting nine in for n thanks Rory;student:Put nine in for n,4
teacher:Not onefourth;student:Onefourth,4
teacher:Its going to be less orangey;student:Less orangey,4
teacher:Fivefourths because its five divided by four which we can write as one and onefourth;student:Fivefourths,4
teacher:So in our very first column we want to get the orange juice to one so lets divide by three,4
teacher:So if we take three and we multiply it by three well get to nine tickets which is the same over here,4
teacher:So Diego paid 47 for three tickets and you guys know that I love to annotate,4
teacher:If two things have the same unit rate they have the same rate,4
teacher:So it took her eight minutes to go one  mile which is what we saw right here in her display,4
teacher:Yeah 110 310 710 and 910 you got it;student:And the next one 09,4
teacher:Thats right so were gonna write x one y one for the first point then were gonna write x two y two for the second point;student:Marked like an x one and a y one,4
teacher:So 12 is equivalent to 5;student:I think that is 15,4
teacher:1 2 3,4
teacher:Five pieces;student:I cut the five pieces,4
teacher:Absolutely so it is bigger on the number line;student:I think its three fourths because it is in a bigger spot on the number line,4
teacher:One over two or one half;student:One on top of two,4
teacher:One out of two or one half;student:One out of two,4
teacher:Were going to divide it;student:Were going to divide,4
teacher:So were not taking because were not subtracting but it is getting smaller;student:Take away,4
teacher:Yeah two times;student:Two times,4
teacher:Im going to divide my eight and my 12 by four,4
teacher:Because six divided by three is two;student:Because you can fit three two times into six,4
teacher:Because two four six eight 10 12;student:Six,4
teacher:Im going to use two,4
teacher:One two three and six because one times six is six two times three is six,4
teacher:One times two;student:Sorry one times two,4
teacher:Multiples are skip counting just like Arcane said,4
teacher:54 90ths,4
teacher:Yeah absolutely;student:Yeah,4
teacher:Any number but I would make it one through twelve just to make it easier;student:Can it be any number,4
teacher:Each person would get one piece out of each of the pizzas Because there are six pieces;student:six pieces of pizza,4
teacher:16th because I have six pieces and all and each of my people is getting one of them;student:16th,4
teacher:no because even in this one pizza all my pieces are not equal;student:No,4
teacher:Okay so I cannot split what I have left into thirds Because person one has already taken from the pizza;student:Now Can you please split them into thirds,4
teacher:would be a two because in each pizza in each whole theres two pieces;student:your denominator would be a two,4
teacher:Well so my eight have smaller pieces absolutely;student:Four eighths,4
teacher:Now repeat is just kind of something that we like remember;student:What about repeat,4
teacher:A thousand okay Im not going to be able to do thatim going to do as many as I can,4
teacher:So she put that in order,4
teacher:So diagram D has 5 of something and 2 of something,4
teacher:I think any time you add some white its going to make it lighter,4
teacher:You are finding onefourth of 24,4
teacher:Yeah we multiply it by 14;student:We multiply it,4
teacher:You should simplify,4
teacher:You have three prepointe shoes,4
teacher:Now what Brandon thought about dividing people into groups,4
teacher:I have five of you two of you thought GCF one of you wasnt sure two of you thought LCM,4
teacher:Theyre going to split things up into some different groups and they have to have an equal number in both groups,4
teacher:I liked how youre thinking about how you would solve this problem to help you decide if the LCM or GCF,4
teacher:Anytime youre listing multiples;student:Multiples,4
teacher:Yeah on 12;student:Yes,4
teacher:Fourths;student:Four,4
teacher:So I can show two and two fourths exactly how Mr Tony just walked me through it,4
teacher:It has a whole number,4
teacher:Three good;student:Three,4
teacher:I have three in all but out of two;student:I mean two,4
teacher:Fivetenths is the same things as saying fiftyone hundredths,4
teacher:Yeah I see you going like this and Manny said multiply;student:Multiply,4
teacher:So Pedro just said he said they have the same denominator but five is greater than two,4
teacher:Three out of a hundred which means I put it here;student:Three out of a hundred,4
teacher:Three good;student:Three,4
teacher:So you guys remember how ridiculous I sound when I say The bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces,4
teacher:So ordering like on Amazon,4
teacher:Everything is correct so far yeah;student:Right,4
teacher:Divide Colton;student:divide,4
teacher:Yeah one;student:One,4
teacher:No they are on the same team;student:No,4
teacher:Okay so This is not a scrimmage;student:Only scrimage,4
teacher:The next step is the body,4
teacher:Yes a prime number,4
teacher:well composite has more than two factors;student:composter I think,4
teacher:no there certainly are not;student:No,4
teacher:It has way more than one factor pair has way more than two factors,4
teacher:7 Absolutely,4
teacher:Have one factor pair Which means they have only two factors,4
teacher:No not not not not one multiple;student:They have one Multiple,4
teacher:yes three times five;student:Three times five,4
teacher:yeah;student:Yes,4
teacher:It would be from zero to 2;student:So,4
teacher:The period is,4
teacher:Well no its halfway around the circle but its completed its pattern because it just repeats its pattern every top half bottom half of the circle;student:When it does one line thats the whole circle,4
teacher:Yes so the range is all real numbers;student:Yes,4
teacher:2  because it has to do an up loop and a down loop and then it repeats itself;student:2,4
teacher:1 to one;student:One to 1,4
teacher:3  4   5;student:x 3,4
teacher:2,4
teacher:Yeah 110 you got it or 1;student:I think the very last one would be 1 first,4
teacher:Heck no;student:No,4
teacher:Thats 2;student:Two,4
teacher:So I know that Im done with my body,4
teacher:4 times two is eight,4
teacher:good six times eight;student:Going six times 8,4
teacher:So like say I have six and nine again,4
teacher:And so we get this person gets one,4
teacher:Five because there are five in the ones okay;student:Five,4
teacher:Because there is a five in the 10s place;student:Five,4
teacher:Oh Adeline Did it the same way;student:I did it the same way too,4
teacher:a sum;student:Sum,4
teacher:So theyre different equations theyre doing different things,4
teacher:It is repeated subtraction,4
teacher:Okay so division and multiplication are inverse equations;student:Division is basically backwards multiplication,4
teacher:This one is going to be 50,4
teacher:Yeah I could count by fives;student:Miss you can also count by 5s,4
teacher:okay so I just kind of put the lines I just had it you can really put them anywhere;student:Im confused why you put the lines,4
teacher:Yeah its just 50,4
teacher:But I could take this and I could say okay theres two on this side,4
teacher:Hes gonna drink 400 gallons of milk,4
teacher:700 that makes my stomach hurt,4
teacher:Yes I need to subtract four;student:You need to subract four,4
teacher:Okay  so Kole just said Well I know that four quarters if I have a quarter that equals 25 cents;student:Four times is 100,4
teacher:249 eggs now,4
teacher:So if this is bigger than four,4
teacher:No no not trick questions;student:Are you supposed to add them up afterwards,4
teacher:Yes;student:Yeah,4
teacher:no no because theres nothing under the zero;student:No,4
teacher:So the arm was our answers right here;student:isnt an arm,4
teacher:Exactly the leg;student:leg,4
teacher:If we doubled both of them it would be 2 and 6,4
teacher:So now that Im on zero Dakota just like put me on zeros right now,4
teacher:And six times five is 30;student:And then six goes into 30 five times,4
teacher:So youre saying 20 fifths and 24 fourths;student:And therefore its 10 is 24 would be 24 fourths which would theyre not be equal,4
teacher:One and one fourth liters of soda water,4
teacher:One and one third;student:One,4
teacher:So lets divide both the top and the bottom by three,4
teacher:One two three four,4
teacher:It wouldnt be that far off but its still going to taste different,4
teacher:So in both instances we can see that three tickets would cost 47,4
teacher:So it says Andre paid 141,4
teacher:They both had the same level of 12;student:They were both on the same level of 12,4
teacher:So they burned a different number of calories,4
teacher:Yeah they went the same distance;student:So a thing thats the same is the same distance,4
teacher:Its probably miles;student:Miles,4
teacher:You know what if you can do divided by six and you can do it mentally in your head yes;student:Could it be accomplished both the four and the two by just dividing it by six,4
teacher:Cause two is going to give us to the price per one ounce,4
teacher:Okay so we can say half or 3 divided by three is a dollar;student:I simply just divide it,4
teacher:Oh you divided it by three;student:I did 12 divided by three,4
teacher:I was just talking about dividing 324 by four,4
teacher:I think six would be a little trickier just cause I think that would require a little bit more work to the side but we could do four;student:Or six,4
teacher:We could do four;student:We could divide it by four,4
teacher:Yeah so one divided by four one fourth when we talk about money is 25 cents;student:One divided by four is 25 cents,4
teacher:We divided by four again;student:Divided by four,4
teacher:That means four ounces and 4 divided by four would be one,4
teacher:So Frankies mom because she can go three more miles per gallon than Sammys mom,4
teacher:Its 45 fifths but we can simplify it into a whole number,4
teacher:We can do multiplication in any order and we still get the same answer,4
teacher:I added one plus three and that equals four,4
teacher:Yeah we can multiply our first column by three;student:Well we could multiply the first column by three,4
teacher:Okay so youre thinking 3 or 5 for one half;student:I think that the first box would be  Well I waSt sure if it was 3 or 5,4
teacher:It is going to start repeating again because 6 will go into 40 six times;student:Its just going to start repeating again,4
teacher:5 is half of 1,4
teacher:See if one of your diagrams represents 3 cups of tomato sauce and 9 tablespoons of oil,4
teacher:So lets multiply by 5 here because we can scale it up to get a denominator of 100,4
teacher:Yeah you can go up or down yeah;student:What you could do is on a ratio table since you can do either the up and down but still being the exact same numerator and denominator  Well not exact same but almost the same thing,4
teacher:So 13 is equivalent to 3 repeating,4
teacher:Because I could get it to go into 10,4
teacher:100 its 100 of a dollar;student:100,4
teacher:Yeah we can 5 five tenths;student:5,4
teacher:25 you got it;student:25,4
teacher:So two groups of 75,4
teacher:Yeah so it takes 10 dimes;student:Ten is equal to 10 of a hundred,4
teacher:Yeah five percent of a dollar;student:Its five percent of a dollar,4
teacher:Yeah percentage absolutely;student:I was going to say pretty much the cent for percentage,4
teacher:Yeah because a century is 100 years;student:Because I was also watching on the Monday video of Khan Academy that they were talking about cent means century,4
teacher:Percent yeah;student:A percent,4
teacher:It would be 15 dimes;student:15 dimes,4
teacher:You could do exactly 150 pennies definitely;student:Well it depends on what cents are counted by but you could do 150 pennies,4
teacher:I like that you also added a decimal when you said 25 that you also added that fraction and the percent and the decimal into the mix;student:And since 4 x 25 and a quarter is 25 cents that would equal one dollar,4
teacher:So Im going to multiply by seven which means I have 21 parts oil 14 parts soy sauce seven parts orange juice and that will get me to a total of 42,4
teacher:So oil is one of our parts,4
teacher:Yeah boots;student:Boots,4
teacher:Yeah five to six;student:So I guess five,4
teacher:We could do 10 which is ten hundredths,4
teacher:Okay so you split 156 into 150 and six;student:So like 75,4
teacher:Yeah 25 cents goes into a dollar four times;student:Because 25 cents goes into a dollar four times,4
teacher:Yeah so it might be the amount of money you earn in one hour;student:Basically how much of something that theyre getting from one,4
teacher:Were going to put an f for flour and a v for vanilla,4
teacher:When you write your ratio group you can write one two four,4
teacher:Yeah one cup of water;student:Because theres four teaspoons of koolaid and theres just one thing of water,4
teacher:Yeah theyre equal;student:That theyre equal,4
teacher:We have the smaller blocks which are actually our koolaid;student:I thought that the smaller blocks were water,4
teacher:It would be 18 yeah,4
teacher:Yeah we would have 12;student:12,4
teacher:If we divide that into two groups we can have two equal groups,4
teacher:He said for every three hexagons there is one trapezoid,4
teacher:For every nine triangles there are six hexagons;student:I said for every nine triangles there is six hexagons,4
teacher:Yeah so six boxes would have 48 bars;student:Because that would be 48 next and if you added that to 80 you would get 138 and you wanted to get as close to 130 as possible,4
teacher:I would definitely multiply times 10,4
teacher:Oh it would be 12 Im so sorry;student:WOuldnt it be 12 people,4
teacher:Yeah you were supposed to draw it;student:Wait are we supposed to draw one,4
teacher:Calculators okay;student:Calculators,4
teacher:Rulers umhmm;student:Rulers,4
teacher:Awesome a division ladder is an excellent tool;student:We used a division ladder a couple weeks ago,4
teacher:Page 52,4
teacher:Its a simplified version of a ratio when specifically one of your values is one;student:I think its the hard version of a ratio,4
teacher:So Charlie said if we take away that decimal point,4
teacher:So divide both of these by 4 and 16 by 4 is 4 and 4 divided by 4 is 1 heres your answer,4
teacher:Itll go in 20,4
teacher:Itll go more than 10;student:Ten times,4
teacher:Five to two you got it;student:Five to two,4
teacher:Im going to multiply it;student:You have to multiply it,4
teacher:You subtract whatever is in that column;student:Do you always subtract always only one from the bottom,4
teacher:If we multiply it by five youre right you would get 25,4
teacher:Instead of dividing by three were going to divide by something else;student:Divide by three,4
teacher:And then for our problem we can say 16 and then your right we can divide both of these by four,4
teacher:Now if it says five batches of cookies if I multiply it by two Im going to double it;student:Two,4
teacher:So youre saying that overall since the dog is doing more tricks they get more treats;student:Cause the dog does more tricks so more treats,4
teacher:The nice part about dividing by three is that automatically gets us to 3,4
teacher:They both have a factor of three;student:They both have multiples of three I think,4
teacher:Two words and two numbers;student:Two words,4
teacher:So tax on food works differently;student:Because you have to pay the taxes,4
teacher:Okay so four avocados is 2;student:And that is four,4
teacher:So 16 avocado is going to cost us 8,4
teacher:Yeah we can just do bottles if we want to;student:Large bottles,4
teacher:Eight avocados is 4;student:Eight avocados and 4,4
teacher:Okay so if you kind of work backwards 10 times 12 is 120 so thats too low;student:I think 10 is too low because 10 times 12 is 120,4
teacher:12 times 10 is 120,4
teacher:So 20 remainder six or 20 and six 12ths,4
teacher:Yeah they are;student:Yeah,4
teacher:And well multiply it keep going sweetie,4
teacher:It kind of looks like theyre they kind of looked like their fractions;student:It kind of looks they are fractions,4
teacher:Yeah so you do 25 50 75;student:Well if you split a dollar in four 75 would be the third out of the four,4
teacher:They would get three and a half treats for every trick,4
teacher:Well its not two thirds;student:Thats two thirds,4
teacher:We have avocados and money,4
teacher:Its B but its really;student:B,5
teacher:So anyone have A and want to share with that  first,5
teacher:And what would you say is that amount,5
teacher:Point to B for us,5
teacher:What quadrant is this,5
teacher:And then what quadrant is this one,5
teacher:Sarah what did you get,5
teacher:Okay so it says estimate the greatest account balance on which day did it occur,5
teacher:So the ordered pair is positive positive so what quadrant is this,5
teacher:Okay last one Hunter,5
teacher:What axis is this,5
teacher:On what day,5
teacher:What is an ordered pair,5
teacher:Whats the ordered pair Aiden,5
teacher:D,5
teacher:So what is the fraction,5
teacher:Sophia how many do we have,5
teacher:A fourth of a;student:Half,5
teacher:We want to know what fraction of a large container is a cup,5
teacher:Well which one of these is a large container based on this,5
teacher:What would be the ordered pair for this dot right here,5
teacher:Erica based on our key which container is a large container,5
teacher:A quart is,5
teacher:But what it wants is it wants to know how much is a single cup of this,5
teacher:What fraction of super size container is one pint,5
teacher:So if I were to put a cup in here what would it look like,5
teacher:How many of your pictures look like that,5
teacher:So the question says what fraction of a large container is one cup,5
teacher:How many cups does it take to make one quart,5
teacher:How many,5
teacher:And by definition of a denominate a denominator is the total number of,5
teacher:Parts needed to make;student:Parts,5
teacher:So we know that we need four cups to fill this guy up but the question says how many do we have,5
teacher:What would a cup look like inside my quart,5
teacher:The one that Franclin just shared for us,5
teacher:Like I say that what am I really talking about,5
teacher:So how much money did they have on day five,5
teacher:Did you get an answer Alexander,5
teacher:It starts with a C whos got it;student:Since the  right next to the thing whatever,5
teacher:If Terrell climbs these three buildings how many more stories will he need to climb to reach his goal of 400,5
teacher:So I just want you to think through this how could you start to problem solve this,5
teacher:What could he be doing here,5
teacher:If Terrell climbs these three buildings how many more stories will he need to climb to reach his goal of 400,5
teacher:How do we find out What do we do to start to think about this,5
teacher:You have an idea Julia,5
teacher:What numbers,5
teacher:Miguel what am I going to do next,5
teacher:James you had another strategy,5
teacher:How did you get 60,5
teacher:But if we have one we have how much of a gallon,5
teacher:What could that be,5
teacher:What are you thinking Owen,5
teacher:So where would 900 AM be  on this graph,5
teacher:Who can remember the definition of absolute value,5
teacher:What does that mean;student:Its 5000 below zero,5
teacher:What does the absolute value tell us;student:Well that would be 130,5
teacher:So if at six negative 50 this really just says this means on the sixth day,5
teacher:And then whats the chRiver here,5
teacher:From 350 down to 275  how much did they spend between day three and day four,5
teacher:350 to 275;student:Zero dollars,5
teacher:How much is that,5
teacher:What might that be,5
teacher:What did you say,5
teacher:So what does the point  six negative 50 tell you about the account balance,5
teacher:So they go from negative 50 to 100 so how much have they gained here,5
teacher:What could that be in real life,5
teacher:Why would you gain 15000,5
teacher:100 to negative 80 so they spent how much,5
teacher:Going from 100 to negative 80,5
teacher:All right last thing just thinking how real life what would this jump be,5
teacher:Right here they have,5
teacher:How can we interpret absolute value of negative 50 in this  case,5
teacher:Going from negative 50 to 100,5
teacher:So how many quarts does it take to fill a gallon;student:That the gallons put into there because its the half because of the quart,5
teacher:How many cups are there going to be for three pints,5
teacher:What do you notice about that one,5
teacher:Whats another way we say that in math,5
teacher:So Alex what was your next cup,5
teacher:How many,5
teacher:What if I told you its thumbs down,5
teacher:Well in this if the pints are doubling so are the,5
teacher:We have two and what does it jump to,5
teacher:So using Alexs thinking  what about for the next cup,5
teacher:Howd you figure that out,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:But what about the next one,5
teacher:So what about five,5
teacher:Joanna what are we going to do,5
teacher:Carrington what are they giving us,5
teacher:So the question here now is what are we going to divide by 16,5
teacher:So Nancy when I divide 16 by 2 what do I get;student:Yes,5
teacher:Mathematically speaking what do you do mathematically to double something,5
teacher:What do you mean you doubled it;student:And then I doubled that two,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:How did you come up with your numbers,5
teacher:How many are there,5
teacher:How many cups are in one pint,5
teacher:One quart how many pints are there in each quart,5
teacher:What did we get,5
teacher:What did you come up with,5
teacher:How many pints are there in a quart,5
teacher:How many quarts are there in a gallon,5
teacher:What do you get,5
teacher:How many quarts are there in a gallon,5
teacher:In a half a gallon how many quarts would there be,5
teacher:So how many cups are in one pint,5
teacher:So if one pint equals two cups how many is two pints worth,5
teacher:How many is three,5
teacher:Three times two,5
teacher:How many is five;student:Is six,5
teacher:Alex walk us through it,5
teacher:Maya how many,5
teacher:Maya what do you notice,5
teacher:What about this guy;student:Im not sure how,5
teacher:Number one says what fraction of a large container is one cup,5
teacher:It says what fraction of a large container is one cup,5
teacher:So when it says what fraction of a large container what does that mean the large container must be,5
teacher:So what would you draw for question one to symbolize the question,5
teacher:What do you notice about my picture,5
teacher:Ricky whats something you notice about my picture that I drew over there on the right side of the board,5
teacher:So if its not random what is it;student:No,5
teacher:Now what do you notice,5
teacher:what do you notice about that picture that I just drew,5
teacher:Maya what do you notice,5
teacher:So if I take my cup and I stick it into my pint how much did I fill up,5
teacher:So if we have one cup how much of a pint do we actually have,5
teacher:What do you notice about pint to quart,5
teacher:Caitlin what do you notice,5
teacher:But what about the last one,5
teacher:What do you notice about this last one,5
teacher:I want to figure out what fraction of a large container is one cup,5
teacher:Which one of those two would you be ordering,5
teacher:If youre going to order from somebody what are you going to actually order,5
teacher:When were looking for a large size what is it worth,5
teacher:Jackson what does it want us to do,5
teacher:Now turning it into a fraction how are we going to do that,5
teacher:What strategies do you guys have from our time of using fractions thatll help us figure out what we have to do here,5
teacher:What did I just do,5
teacher:What did I just do,5
teacher:Jose whatd I just do,5
teacher:What does that look like,5
teacher:How many quarts are there in a gallon,5
teacher:What is that sitting up on the board,5
teacher:What would you have,5
teacher:what would you have,5
teacher:Whats my numerator;student:Yes,5
teacher:Aleah whats my numerator in this problem,5
teacher:What is my denominator,5
teacher:But what are they,5
teacher:Because in this problem when were looking for a small size what is it worth,5
teacher:What did I just create,5
teacher:The first building he climbed was,5
teacher:How would I figure out five times five,5
teacher:Whats the next one,5
teacher:Factor times a factor equals,5
teacher:And I might say we have,5
teacher:Part of it because we know that three times three equals what,5
teacher:If I needed to figure out how many squares were in here on a five by five array what would I say,5
teacher:Julia what would you do,5
teacher:How many groups of five do we need in this case,5
teacher:So five times five is,5
teacher:What is the area of the room youre trying to fill,5
teacher:Before I hear answers I want to know how you thought about this problem,5
teacher:What did you do to solve it,5
teacher:David what was one of your strategies,5
teacher:Ella what was your strategy,5
teacher:So you were counting by what number,5
teacher:Did everybody match with one of the strategies that was up there,5
teacher:Whats five times seven,5
teacher:So we said three by three array would equal,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:I gave you a word yesterday and I said these two numbers are called remember what that is,5
teacher:Ella do you remember what a square number is;student:Mmhmm,5
teacher:Were probably not memorized as well but if we did seven it would say seven and then;student:We could skip count by 10 quintillion,5
teacher:14 and then,5
teacher:21 and then,5
teacher:Four,5
teacher:12;student:Eight 16,5
teacher:What was the next,5
teacher:No they already showed us one by one two by two three by three four by four;student:A one by one,5
teacher:What was your strategy for this one,5
teacher:Five by five and the one after that would be;student:Five by five,5
teacher:What was our whole lesson based around,5
teacher:David what was it based around,5
teacher:Alan what do you remember from yesterday,5
teacher:What were we making with arrays,5
teacher:Penelope what were we making with arrays,5
teacher:Does anybody remember what a square number is,5
teacher:Or can you just tell me whats a square number,5
teacher:What did we do yesterday,5
teacher:What else are you good at counting by;student:Yes,5
teacher:Owen what was your strategy,5
teacher:What answer did you get,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:Lets talk about two two times what gives me 56,5
teacher:Diego what is it,5
teacher:Four and what,5
teacher:And then what about five,5
teacher:What about six,5
teacher:What about six;student:Five and 11,5
teacher:What about six,5
teacher:What about seven,5
teacher:So what are my factors if I had to make a list of my factors what would my list be,5
teacher:Audrey what would my list be,5
teacher:Now if I want my factor pairs what would I say,5
teacher:How many cups are there in one pint,5
teacher:Whats another factor pair Chloe,5
teacher:Audrey what would be a factor pair,5
teacher:Whats the first branch of the rainbow,5
teacher:Where is your starting point,5
teacher:What times what equals 56,5
teacher:So a factor pair are the two specific numbers that we have to combine to get that  Whats the answer to a multiplication problem,5
teacher:What are our strategies,5
teacher:Julia what did you do,5
teacher:Any other strategies out there,5
teacher:Ella what did you do,5
teacher:You said;student:Yeah,5
teacher:And then I did 12 then 16 then,5
teacher:And then she counted one two three four five six groups of four is,5
teacher:Mila what did you do,5
teacher:Now it says well whats the area,5
teacher:Whats the area,5
teacher:Somebody tell me whats a five by eight,5
teacher:Whats my area,5
teacher:whats my area,5
teacher:How many square feet of fabric will  need,5
teacher:So yesterday what did we talk about,5
teacher:So what is the difference between a factor and factor pairs,5
teacher:If this is a five by eight rectangle how many squares are in there,5
teacher:And how many stories was that,5
teacher:Two,5
teacher:How is multiplication related to addition,5
teacher:And how tall was building number four,5
teacher:How tall was the last building that he climbed,5
teacher:How are we going to tackle this,5
teacher:What is that asking us to do,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:David what are you thinking,5
teacher:What would you add David,5
teacher:What would you add,5
teacher:Chloe what do you think,5
teacher:What do you think James,5
teacher:How many stories is in the last building;student:To figure out how many stories is in the last building,5
teacher:What would we do,5
teacher:Nathan what do you think,5
teacher:But how are we going to figure out how tall this number four building is,5
teacher:James what do you think,5
teacher:How tall was building number three,5
teacher:How tall was building number two,5
teacher:Building number one he climbed was how many,5
teacher:And whats the next sentence say,5
teacher:And how many stories was that,5
teacher:And my last building,5
teacher:And how much was that,5
teacher:So what is my question statement,5
teacher:What is it asking me to do,5
teacher:How many stories did he climb in all,5
teacher:How many stories did he climb in all,5
teacher:How much more would he need to get to 472,5
teacher:In all tells us we want to do what James,5
teacher:What kind of answers did you get,5
teacher:Ella whatd you get,5
teacher:Carrie whatd you get,5
teacher:Whatd you get,5
teacher:So I have eight plus two I get,5
teacher:Eight plus two is,5
teacher:So the answer how many stories did he climb,5
teacher:So when you added things up what did you get as the answers,5
teacher:Is there something else were really good at counting by,5
teacher:Three plus zero plus one is,5
teacher:Plus zero;student:Eight,5
teacher:Ricardo what do you think,5
teacher:Okay so five,5
teacher:Olando whatd you do,5
teacher:Im adding up five groups of;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Okay what kind of array is that,5
teacher:How many dots are there,5
teacher:When I think of this if I were to connect these dots  sit up what shape would I get,5
teacher:What kind of array is this,5
teacher:Lets do What kind of array is this,5
teacher:How many dots are here,5
teacher:How many dots are here,5
teacher:How many dots are here;student:Nine,5
teacher:So that when I go ahead and turn it into a square or put it into an array and close it up I actually get,5
teacher:How do those two things connect,5
teacher:Julia how do they connect,5
teacher:What strategy did you use to find that,5
teacher:How do we know theres 25,5
teacher:So how many dots are there,5
teacher:How many dots do I have going down,5
teacher:One plus one plus one,5
teacher:Now what,5
teacher:James what am I going to do,5
teacher:Is what is it;student:Yes,5
teacher:Whats three minus three;student:Yes,5
teacher:Now if I asked you how many dots were in there;student:Yeah mmhmm,5
teacher:Okay so how many dots are in there,5
teacher:Six plus two is;student:Four,5
teacher:So now let me ask you this what is multiplication;student:Mmhmm,5
teacher:How else would you describe it,5
teacher:How else would you describe it,5
teacher:When I asked you the question I said okay how many dots did I put here what did you do,5
teacher:How did you figure out how many dots were here,5
teacher:And then what did you do,5
teacher:Counted how,5
teacher:How many dots do I have going across,5
teacher:So let me ask you this question what is multiplication;student:Yeah,5
teacher:So we just simply multiply those altogether to figure out how many cups are there,5
teacher:How do I get from this to this,5
teacher:But then how many pints are in a gallon,5
teacher:So she picked two because two divided by two is,5
teacher:Okay now what are you doing,5
teacher:So Miss Keegan as the T what would you tell people about 210 and onefifth;student:And 10 divided by two is five so I got onefifth for 210,5
teacher:Which means the,5
teacher:All right so what are you going to do now Miss Keegan,5
teacher:What do you know about 510 without doing any math,5
teacher:When you look at 510 what do you know about it without doing any math at all,5
teacher:What do you mean its half,5
teacher:What do you do now,5
teacher:What fraction are we trying to make,5
teacher:How,5
teacher:Howd you get 510,5
teacher:Howd you do that,5
teacher:How are you getting those fractions,5
teacher:How are you going from onefifth to whatever you got,5
teacher:Miss Keegan what did you do,5
teacher:And then how are you going from onehalf to whatever you got,5
teacher:What are you going to get,5
teacher:What are you going to get,5
teacher:So what am I going to divide by,5
teacher:Four divided by what equals one,5
teacher:Whatever we do to the top,5
teacher:Whats our denominator;student:We do to the bottom,5
teacher:Which ones better,5
teacher:What was the difference from the last one to this one that made this a little bit easier,5
teacher:So have you noticed so far as Johnny pointed out earlier so far we have only dealt with denominators that are what,5
teacher:What have all of our denominators been,5
teacher:And it leads back to his great question at the beginning well what if we have a denominator that isnt divisible by two,5
teacher:Now what can you divide both of those by to get your one,5
teacher:In the red how many of them are going to be red,5
teacher:Two out of;student:Two,5
teacher:Whats our second fraction going to be Helena in blue,5
teacher:How many are there,5
teacher:Out of,5
teacher:What does it say Ben;student:At the end,5
teacher:How do you get from this to this,5
teacher:Whatd you multiply here to get here,5
teacher:Two times one is one,5
teacher:How are your people changing because each person that comes up to touch the lockers is different,5
teacher:What is that third person going to come along and do Camila,5
teacher:Were now on third person what are they going to do,5
teacher:Theyre going to come along and touch what lockers,5
teacher:What are those numbers,5
teacher:What are those numbers,5
teacher:Can we think of another way to term it,5
teacher:Something weve learned this year,5
teacher:Lets have Emerson help me out,5
teacher:Yeah can we think of an even better term that weve learned fairly recently;student:Three,5
teacher:369 12 1518 are multiples of what,5
teacher:So whats it going to happen,5
teacher:So what is person three gonna do,5
teacher:Whats person number four going to do,5
teacher:So were dealing with multiples of,5
teacher:What are they wanting you to do with your people,5
teacher:So now in this problem you need to start thinking of the dynamics of the question what are the variables,5
teacher:So after person one is here every single locker is,5
teacher:Whats the 21st person going to do,5
teacher:Okay so thats one of them but what about the other one,5
teacher:All right so how do you prove this,5
teacher:Well how do you prove to somebody that youre right,5
teacher:How do I do that,5
teacher:I multiply by,5
teacher:Johnny whatever I;student:Two,5
teacher:Onefifth is equivalent to,5
teacher:Knox this is the way you did it so what did you add to 112,5
teacher:What am I going to multiply by,5
teacher:Whats the best method to actually try and figure it out,5
teacher:Whats it going to be now,5
teacher:Okay so what was your final answer;student:Theres only one locker each time,5
teacher:200 opened or 200 closed;student:It was 200 because,5
teacher:Okay so how did you determine your final number,5
teacher:What gave you your final number based on your what you saw from your sample,5
teacher:Walk us through yours,5
teacher:Whatever I do to the bottom,5
teacher:So what am I going to have to add to 112 to get us to 512,5
teacher:Exactly right because we need to find a common denominator we could find between these two;student:I think it would be 512,5
teacher:Whats onefourth plus onesixth,5
teacher:Is that wrong or right,5
teacher:Is what I did on the board wrong or right;student:Right,5
teacher:Whats oneninth plus oneninth plus oneninth,5
teacher:What would this box be Kameron,5
teacher:So what can we do,5
teacher:Keegan what can we do,5
teacher:Keegan what am I going to get,5
teacher:So now if we add onethird and oneninth together does that equal fourninths,5
teacher:We just proved that onethird is the exact same thing as what,5
teacher:And what does an equivalent fraction mean,5
teacher:Esme what is an equivalent fraction,5
teacher:Yeah but what does that mean,5
teacher:What does it mean for two fractions to be equal,5
teacher:But in order to eat the same amount we have to eat how many slices here,5
teacher:Here how many do we have to eat;student:Three,5
teacher:Come on whats the problem with doing that,5
teacher:But whats the problem with that,5
teacher:Well how can you make fourninths using addition,5
teacher:How many pieces do they want to break it into this time,5
teacher:How did they take those two and make them onehalf,5
teacher:Whats another factor pair Nathan,5
teacher:Kane what do you think,5
teacher:What do we get when we add onefourth and onefourth,5
teacher:What do we get when we add,5
teacher:If we were doing modern fractions and modern adding of fractions and we had onefourth plus onefourth what would our answer be,5
teacher:So what do we have to do,5
teacher:So how many lines will you have,5
teacher:We have to convert our fraction to the smallest possible numerator which is,5
teacher:What would we have to do,5
teacher:So what are we going to have to do,5
teacher:Whats wrong,5
teacher:What very very very very very very very important rule did I forget,5
teacher:Genevieve what very important rule did I forget when I did this,5
teacher:If youre going to divide something youre going to have to divide both the top and the bottom of your fraction which would of course leave us with,5
teacher:How many pieces do they want to break it into in this example,5
teacher:So how would we get twofourths and turn it into onehalf,5
teacher:What is four right now,5
teacher:So what are we going to have to add to get us to threeeighths,5
teacher:What was the first thing you did Miss Genevieve,5
teacher:How many red pieces do I have;student:Four,5
teacher:The total is,5
teacher:I started by drawing or coloring in three squares,5
teacher:312;student:And what fraction did you say that these three were worth,5
teacher:What was your next move,5
teacher:And what was your fraction here;student:Then I colored in two,5
teacher:All right so Miss Elyse what did you do now,5
teacher:Whats wrong with 212,5
teacher:So you took your 212 and what did you do with it Miss Elyse,5
teacher:And what did you come up with;student:I divided 212 by two and the numerator and the denominator,5
teacher:And how would that look,5
teacher:So what next Miss Elyse,5
teacher:What did you do now,5
teacher:So what did you do,5
teacher:So the final step is well if this is the same thing as onefourth and we add that to onesixth whats the answer,5
teacher:But if I do it in red how many pieces do I have;student:Yes,5
teacher:What does it actually do Keegan,5
teacher:Dividing this two when you divide a fraction by two what does it actually do,5
teacher:What does that actually do,5
teacher:Okay then what did you do,5
teacher:Did you color two to start or one to start,5
teacher:Then whatd you do,5
teacher:But whats the problem,5
teacher:We cant have two in the,5
teacher:So what are we going to do,5
teacher:What are we going to do Kameron,5
teacher:So how did you solve this,5
teacher:Okay then tell me what to do Miss Grace,5
teacher:What am I dividing,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:What do you want me to do up here,5
teacher:Where is this eight coming from that you want me to divide,5
teacher:What do we need to fix,5
teacher:Because Genevieve did it right but we have a problem and whats our problem,5
teacher:What cant we have up here,5
teacher:What am I dividing,5
teacher:Well how many are there,5
teacher:And if this fifth person comes along and touches every fifth locker which lockers Victoria will be touched by the fifth person,5
teacher:Okay what else,5
teacher:Do you know Miss Rory what a ray is,5
teacher:Now what does a ray look like,5
teacher:What did I just do,5
teacher:What did I just do,5
teacher:What did I do,5
teacher:What did I do,5
teacher:Charlie what did I do,5
teacher:Can anyone think of a better way to name that than just say I wrote an A or B,5
teacher:When you are writing lines line segments or rays you must label them with a minimum of,5
teacher:When will I ever use lines line segments or rays in my life,5
teacher:But what did I use,5
teacher:And thats where were going to lead into is how do these three items help us to make polygons,5
teacher:And then once we made polygons how do we identify polygons,5
teacher:What is a polygon,5
teacher:Are there more than one type of polygon,5
teacher:There is one other shape that were going to talk about today that fits with lines line segments and the third does anybody know what it is called,5
teacher:Hmm does anybody know what a polygon is,5
teacher:So a line segment looks just like a line except where the arrows are there is a starting point and a,5
teacher:Or do you know what it is,5
teacher:What is geometry,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:What did I just put on the board,5
teacher:What did I just put on the board,5
teacher:Can anybody think of a time in mathematical terms where weve used the word point already,5
teacher:When did we use it,5
teacher:Well what is the decimal point Matt,5
teacher:What is a decimal point or more importantly what does a decimal point do,5
teacher:What does it do,5
teacher:Well then whats a point,5
teacher:Anybody have a guess in geometric terms what a point is,5
teacher:What is that,5
teacher:What does that,5
teacher:What did I just draw,5
teacher:Emerson theyre called,5
teacher:How many points are there now on it,5
teacher:But what is the name of the line segment,5
teacher:Its still line segment A B F is just a,5
teacher:What do you mean,5
teacher:As we move down this list yes our number goes up but do our sizes go up or down,5
teacher:So how many quart do you see,5
teacher:So in one gallon there are,5
teacher:One gallon there are;student:One,5
teacher:What about pints,5
teacher:What does anybody notice about pints,5
teacher:And finally what about cups,5
teacher:What do you notice about cups,5
teacher:Anybody notice a pattern,5
teacher:Anybody notice a pattern,5
teacher:Maya what pattern do you notice,5
teacher:What about this,5
teacher:Van what do you notice,5
teacher:So how many pints are there in a quart,5
teacher:What do you mean the numbers keep getting bigger;student:The numbers keep getting bigger,5
teacher:what do you notice,5
teacher:So what do you notice about the numbers,5
teacher:what do you notice,5
teacher:Now what is this shape,5
teacher:So  your drawings what do you notice,5
teacher:What stands out to you in this illustration,5
teacher:In this picture,5
teacher:Mr  what do you notice,5
teacher:So in this unit of measure what is our largest unit of measure were going to be dealing with today when measuring liquid,5
teacher:What is our smallest Jackson,5
teacher:Anything else about geometry,5
teacher:What else do you notice about the picture itself,5
teacher:What else does anybody notice,5
teacher:Let me ask a question how many gallons do you see up here,5
teacher:So what else,5
teacher:What else do we see,5
teacher:What else do you notice,5
teacher:How about numbers here folks,5
teacher:Anybody got anything on numbers,5
teacher:What do you guys notice,5
teacher:Anybody else about geometry,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:Can anyone tell me what is geometry,5
teacher:Okay but then how do we get to nine to 16;student:You have four two and then one more,5
teacher:What did I just list,5
teacher:What did I just list underneath the numbers,5
teacher:Whats unique about those numbers and their factors,5
teacher:Alice whats unique about those numbers and their factors,5
teacher:What are the factors of the number three,5
teacher:How many factors is that,5
teacher:Its two factors Okay pick another number my any number other than the open lockers pick;student:Two,5
teacher:Jordan what are the factors of six,5
teacher:How many factors is that;student:One and two and three and six,5
teacher:Pick another one that is not open,5
teacher:Take any other one that is that open,5
teacher:Aiden pick one does not open,5
teacher:Aiden what are the factors of 13,5
teacher:How many factors is that,5
teacher:I have what;student:Divided by three,5
teacher:Are those numbers unique or weird in any way,5
teacher:Does anybody know anything about those numbers,5
teacher:Theres patterns all over the board here,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:So Rory which lockers are we going to be positive so far are going to remain open,5
teacher:Any others,5
teacher:So seven is done and it is,5
teacher:So Aiden in this sample how many lockers are open so far,5
teacher:But does anybody know how they end,5
teacher:Leah do one more,5
teacher:Riley what do you think,5
teacher:Just learn about any patterns,5
teacher:Raise your hand any patterns that you see up here,5
teacher:But lets hear what are your patterns,5
teacher:Jordan what do you see,5
teacher:Anybody know what that number would be,5
teacher:What locker,5
teacher:Were just gonna stick but it leads us to the right pattern,5
teacher:Does anybody notice any patterns,5
teacher:Which locker,5
teacher:Pick any of the lockers that are not open that are closed,5
teacher:What are the factors of 12,5
teacher:Because what is how do you get to 36,5
teacher:Whats one way you can get to 36 using only one factor,5
teacher:So whats going to come next,5
teacher:Whats my next factor,5
teacher:How do we get 49,5
teacher:Seven times,5
teacher:Whats next;student:Seven,5
teacher:Whats next,5
teacher:Whats next,5
teacher:So how can we use that information to help us solve this problem,5
teacher:Aiden how can we use that information to our benefit to solve this problem,5
teacher:Knowing that only the square numbers these numbers right here and then theyll keep going what would be the next one,5
teacher:Can anybody tell me what the next order,5
teacher:After 100,5
teacher:Your job is to figure out without help from anybody at home how many square numbers are there between one and 1000,5
teacher:Its a number you get when you multiply a number by,5
teacher:Square numbers and what is a square number;student:Square numbers,5
teacher:But what types of numbers have an odd number of factors,5
teacher:What what makes them unique numbers,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:But how many are there,5
teacher:Total,5
teacher:6 2 and four are all what,5
teacher:6 2 and four are all what kinds of numbers,5
teacher:How many factors does four have,5
teacher:How many factors does nine have,5
teacher:Any number up here,5
teacher:But how many factors does 16 have,5
teacher:How many does 25 have,5
teacher:What are all of these numbers,5
teacher:Which means all of our closed lockers have what,5
teacher:And all of our open lockers have,5
teacher:What kind of numbers have an odd number of factors,5
teacher:Victoria what do you think,5
teacher:Well no what do those numbers all have in common;student:Times five,5
teacher:How many factors is this;student:Three,5
teacher:Whats another factor pair Grace;student:Four and 13,5
teacher:I know that seven times three is,5
teacher:How many factors does 56 have,5
teacher:Nathan what do you think,5
teacher:What can you tell me about area and perimeter,5
teacher:Ferogio what can you tell me,5
teacher:And you talked about this square which part is which,5
teacher:Which part is the area which part is the perimeter,5
teacher:I said area is  the rug and perimeter is the,5
teacher:What do we do to find the area,5
teacher:If were talking about the area so were talking about the inside what do we do to find out,5
teacher:How do I find the area,5
teacher:If I know my base number and I know my height number how do I find  area,5
teacher:What do you think;student:Yeah,5
teacher:How do we find the perimeter,5
teacher:How do we find the fence,5
teacher:Ethan how do we find the perimeter,5
teacher:Tell me what you did,5
teacher:What would be the next smallest after six13ths,5
teacher:Avery what did you do to find area,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Whats the same the numerators or the denominators,5
teacher:Amy what do you think,5
teacher:How many pieces do I get here,5
teacher:So if I were to think about one10th onethird which ones bigger,5
teacher:So of those three fractions which one do we get the smallest amount,5
teacher:What would be the next smallest one,5
teacher:What would be the largest one,5
teacher:Will you put those in order from smallest to largest,5
teacher:What do you think my smallest is;student:Can I sharpen my pencil,5
teacher:What do you think my smallest fraction is Kevin,5
teacher:Lydia what do you think,5
teacher:Whats next,5
teacher:What am I doing,5
teacher:Chloe what was next,5
teacher:And whats my largest one,5
teacher:All right Mila what order did you put these fractions in,5
teacher:Which one is the smallest,5
teacher:You did what,5
teacher:What  number represents my base,5
teacher:Whats my height,5
teacher:Who wants to walk me through this,5
teacher:Tell me what you did,5
teacher:How did you solve this,5
teacher:What did you do for our perimeter William,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:22 what,5
teacher:Okay what did you do;student:I have a different way to find that base,5
teacher:Yeah because the opposite  of multiplication is;student:So you can use the area divide the area by the height,5
teacher:He said well thats the same as 30 divided by five equals,5
teacher:So what  do we know;student:One more,5
teacher:Whats the area I gave you,5
teacher:Well how do we find the area  for shape;student:By multiplication,5
teacher:How do we start this,5
teacher:Avery what do you think,5
teacher:Okay but what is this right here;student:Oh because to be able to figure out the perimeter and to figure out the height of the box,5
teacher:All right who wants to walk me through,5
teacher:If I plug what I know into my formula how  is that going to help me out,5
teacher:What is the area,5
teacher:What do we know,5
teacher:21 what,5
teacher:How many sides are on my shape,5
teacher:Perimeter equals what did I say my base was,5
teacher:So I need two sevens plus,5
teacher:You want to know what I did,5
teacher:So our perimeter equals what,5
teacher:How does that ABxH and PBBHH how does that help us out,5
teacher:Which one is bigger,5
teacher:Olivia talk to me about area,5
teacher:And what did you get for your final answer;student:Yes,5
teacher:40,5
teacher:Allan you want to walk me through perimeter,5
teacher:Okay all right Allan what did you get here,5
teacher:How did you finish this out,5
teacher:I want to know what does that question mark side equal and whats our perimeter,5
teacher:What do we know,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:what do you think,5
teacher:Are my denominators the same or different,5
teacher:You think foursixths is what;student:Foursixths,5
teacher:And five times five,5
teacher:Chloe what do you multiply by,5
teacher:Whatever we do to the top,5
teacher:Which gives us;student:We do to the bottom,5
teacher:What is it;student:Times six,5
teacher:What do you get as your numerator,5
teacher:What do I multiply nine by to get 45,5
teacher:And I know that whatever I do to the bottom,5
teacher:So whats two times five;student:I do to the top,5
teacher:So my numerator is going to be;student:Ten,5
teacher:What am I doing to one to get four,5
teacher:One times what Penelope,5
teacher:Whatever I do to the top,5
teacher:What is nine times four;student:You do to the bottom,5
teacher:So youre just asking yourself How did they go from this number to this number,5
teacher:Whats one times five,5
teacher:Matteo what did you get,5
teacher:So whats your new fraction,5
teacher:What did you multiply your top and your bottom by,5
teacher:Whatever I do to the bottom Whats one times five,5
teacher:Now you use this trick Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top and I want you to decide right now what are some equivalent fractions for one third,5
teacher:What are some equivalent fractions for one third,5
teacher:What did you come up with,5
teacher:Whats a fraction you came up with Nathan,5
teacher:Nathan what did you multiply by,5
teacher:One times two is,5
teacher:Owen what do you have,5
teacher:Whats another one;student:Yes,5
teacher:James whats another one,5
teacher:What did you multiply by,5
teacher:What would we multiply this one by,5
teacher:How could you have two thirds,5
teacher:What about this one;student:Okay,5
teacher:Whatever you do to the bottom,5
teacher:Because whatever we do to the bottom,5
teacher:What did you get for your fraction,5
teacher:What is this that hes using,5
teacher:Okay whats another one,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:How much;student:I did 10 and 25,5
teacher:What did you multiply by,5
teacher:What did you get,5
teacher:So whatever I do to the bottom,5
teacher:Diego what do you think,5
teacher:Onefifth is what;student:I think its onefifth,5
teacher:Who can give me some more information on that,5
teacher:So our slices are getting,5
teacher:Both of these pieces Im getting two slices but which one gives me actual more pieces,5
teacher:Ella what do you think,5
teacher:So if we were to look at this is that more or less than half,5
teacher:Whatever I do to the bottom,5
teacher:Twosixths and foursixths,5
teacher:Twosixths foursixths,5
teacher:Kevin what do you think,5
teacher:What did he multiply by,5
teacher:What do you think David multiplied by,5
teacher:What did you multiply by to get eight20ths,5
teacher:Kevin what did you get,5
teacher:Nathan what did you do,5
teacher:So how did you figure out these fractions,5
teacher:How did you figure out what your numerator was going to be and what your denominator was going to be,5
teacher:David how did you figure it out,5
teacher:How can you make some equivalent fractions for onethird,5
teacher:Oh Kevin what did you get,5
teacher:How did you get threeninths Kevin,5
teacher:What was your strategy,5
teacher:Whats another one,5
teacher:What did you multiple onethird by to get 1030s;student:1030ths,5
teacher:Chloe what am I multiplying one by to get three,5
teacher:Whatever I do to the top I do to the bottom whats three times three,5
teacher:What did you get,5
teacher:How did you get that,5
teacher:Miguel what did you get,5
teacher:What did you multiply it by,5
teacher:What am I doing to three to get six,5
teacher:Two times what,5
teacher:How many zeros do you have over here,5
teacher:Walk us through perimeter,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:What was your mistake,5
teacher:What if you only have a certain amount of money,5
teacher:You have to stop and think what is it really asking,5
teacher:Whats really really happening in this problem,5
teacher:How many flowers are there in all,5
teacher:How many flowers are in  all,5
teacher:What did we draw,5
teacher:Ella what did  we draw,5
teacher:I know were waiting for this to load but keep telling me what you did,5
teacher:So each circle had four dots to represent;student:Three circles for the vases and I put four dots for the flowers,5
teacher:What kind of an equation did you come up with David,5
teacher:What made it so easy,5
teacher:If the florist has three vases of water how much soda is needed to keep them fresh,5
teacher:If the florist has three vases of water how much soda is needed to keep them fresh,5
teacher:What do you want to try,5
teacher:If the  florist has three vases of water how much soda is needed to keep them fresh,5
teacher:Whats wrong,5
teacher:Whats a good place to start,5
teacher:what did you get,5
teacher:No what was your answer;student:The bottle,5
teacher:Your final  answer,5
teacher:Nathan what was your answer,5
teacher:What was your answer,5
teacher:Julia do you have a written answer,5
teacher:What was yours;student:I got 30 with the remainder of two,5
teacher:What is  it want us to do,5
teacher:How does she know when shes got enough,5
teacher:Why do you think division;student:Division,5
teacher:Groups of what,5
teacher:What is she doing right here;student:Thats going to take forever,5
teacher:Whats our easier way,5
teacher:How many groups of four do I need,5
teacher:Should be dividing by four,5
teacher:What is four times 30,5
teacher:Is there another equation we can use,5
teacher:What kind of a picture did you draw,5
teacher:What did you draw,5
teacher:Whats my equation,5
teacher:Chloe whats my equation,5
teacher:Right now were only talking about what,5
teacher:How much water is she putting in each one,5
teacher:Just looking at the picture  what equation do you find,5
teacher:What equation do you find,5
teacher:Okay tell me what you did,5
teacher:What did you and Ella talk about,5
teacher:Okay so what was your equation then;student:What we talked about is,5
teacher:How many cups of water does she need,5
teacher:How many teaspoons of food coloring does the florist need,5
teacher:How much time do we need,5
teacher:It wants to know how much food coloring  does she need,5
teacher:Where in our information does it talk about food coloring,5
teacher:How does that make sense,5
teacher:One cup here one cup here Whats my equation,5
teacher:How much water is going into each vase,5
teacher:How many cups of water does she need,5
teacher:Did you do it then what did you get,5
teacher:What does this water represent Diego;student:Mmhmm,5
teacher:Okay how much soda did we add;student:Yes,5
teacher:What was the equation that you came up with for this,5
teacher:And what did you get for  an answer;student:I did 14 x 3,5
teacher:What do you think;student:34,5
teacher:Whats different;student:Yes,5
teacher:Whats a bunch,5
teacher:So let me ask what are the answers you got,5
teacher:How many cups of water does the florist need in all,5
teacher:Shh  How many cups of water does the florist need,5
teacher:And how many cups does she need for all five bunches,5
teacher:How much water do we need,5
teacher:Diego how much water do we need,5
teacher:What did you get,5
teacher:What do you call it;student:But the problem is that that doesnt what do you call  it,5
teacher:So you got different answers whatd you get,5
teacher:How many cups of water does the florist need,5
teacher:How many packs should she buy,5
teacher:Whats going on in this problem,5
teacher:How many packs should she buy,5
teacher:Walk me through,5
teacher:I think I lost you  right here you did 10 minus six and got four nine minus one and got,5
teacher:Eight nine minus seven;student:Eight,5
teacher:Five minus one;student:Two,5
teacher:So now what do I do,5
teacher:What should my goal be tonight,5
teacher:What should my goal be tonight,5
teacher:So if I put a 39 how many zeros do I need,5
teacher:Whats 12 minus nine,5
teacher:What do you think comes next,5
teacher:What do you think comes next,5
teacher:what do you think,5
teacher:What does 13 times 20 get me,5
teacher:Three plus three plus three is,5
teacher:And zero plus two is;student:Nine,5
teacher:Walk me through the subtraction,5
teacher:How did you get your answer,5
teacher:Can you tell me the steps that you did;student:So what I got by  and the answer I got 5717,5
teacher:Walk us through Chloe,5
teacher:Whats 50 plus 50,5
teacher:Whats seven plus seven,5
teacher:So our perimeter is,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:So if Im trying to reach that 16  000 how many calories am I going to have to burn each day to meet my goal,5
teacher:I want to know what should my daily goal be,5
teacher:How many calories do I need to burn each day to meet my goal,5
teacher:How many calories do I need to burn to actually  hit the 50,5
teacher:What kinds of things were you trying,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:whatd you try,5
teacher:Tell me what youre dividing,5
teacher:What are you dividing,5
teacher:Whatd you try,5
teacher:Tell me more;student:Because I just figured out that I have to do something completely different,5
teacher:If want 16000 calories and Ive already burned What do I need to do here,5
teacher:What are you thinking  about,5
teacher:How many zeros do you have over here;student:One,5
teacher:How many 50 I need how many calories,5
teacher:Walk me through this,5
teacher:Carrie what do you think,5
teacher:Julia what do you think,5
teacher:How old do you think Ivan is,5
teacher:So in order to make a year how many days will  Ivan have had to have been in the enclosure,5
teacher:How do we take that big number and put it into groups,5
teacher:What would we do,5
teacher:So we know lets think about this we know 365 times one is,5
teacher:What;student:I know exactly what to do,5
teacher:So what is 365 times seven James,5
teacher:Whats 365 times seven,5
teacher:Whats 365 times three,5
teacher:What did  you get there;student:Nope,5
teacher:If you got caught up somewhere along the way what is it that led you in the wrong direction,5
teacher:How many years has he been there,5
teacher:How many packs should she buy,5
teacher:You did what,5
teacher:what did you try,5
teacher:what did you think we should do,5
teacher:Anybody else have thoughts;student:The 365,5
teacher:walk me through this,5
teacher:Now Oscars job is to do what,5
teacher:So if you picture after and hes standing there and all of these people brought him the oranges what is he going to do,5
teacher:How many is he going to put in each basket,5
teacher:How many baskets will be needed for the oranges,5
teacher:So in other words  how many can he make,5
teacher:How many baskets can he make,5
teacher:Okay walk me through this;student:Maybe,5
teacher:What do we need to know first,5
teacher:Then what do you have to  do,5
teacher:Once we know how many oranges he had what are we going to do with,5
teacher:How many years has he been there,5
teacher:What do we need,5
teacher:How many days in a year;student:How many days are in a year,5
teacher:So now what do we do,5
teacher:What do you want to multiply it with;student:Maybe we times it by something because its 9855 days,5
teacher:But then what;student:Addition,5
teacher:How many factor pairs does 56 have;student:Seven and three,5
teacher:What would I multiply two by to get ten;student:Yes,5
teacher:What would my numerator be,5
teacher:How many digits do I have here,5
teacher:40 and the three represents,5
teacher:How many players on this team,5
teacher:How many players on this team;student:Two,5
teacher:Two times two equals;student:Two,5
teacher:My 40 is going to wrestle with who,5
teacher:40 times 20 and who else is my 40 going to wrestle with,5
teacher:Three has to wrestle with who,5
teacher:And then,5
teacher:three times seven is;student:Three times seven,5
teacher:Whats four times two,5
teacher:Eight and then how many zeros do we need;student:Eight,5
teacher:Four times seven is,5
teacher:28 with how many zeros;student:28,5
teacher:What about three times two;student:Mmhmm,5
teacher:Five plus one plus two,5
teacher:Six with how many zeros;student:Six,5
teacher:Zero zero four,5
teacher:24 Good with how many zeros,5
teacher:Five times seven is;student:3500,5
teacher:Plus how many zeros,5
teacher:What does the five stand for really,5
teacher:How much does the five worth please,5
teacher:How much is the five worth;student:One,5
teacher:How much is the eight worth,5
teacher:What about 32,5
teacher:What players do I have here,5
teacher:And what else,5
teacher:Do we know what 50 times 30 is going to be,5
teacher:Whats five times three,5
teacher:How many zeros do I need to add now,5
teacher:Five times two is what,5
teacher:10 and then I need to add,5
teacher:What about eight times three,5
teacher:And eight times two,5
teacher:And three times seven,5
teacher:Zero zero zero one is,5
teacher:Im going to add my eight plus my two because I know that gives me,5
teacher:What are we actually doing,5
teacher:But when were wrestling are we adding are we subtracting;student:Were putting two numbers like the one thats going to wrestle the other ones like,5
teacher:What are we doing,5
teacher:Whats a product,5
teacher:Right whats a product,5
teacher:What do you think it means by partial,5
teacher:What do you think partial means,5
teacher:What would I do first,5
teacher:What would I do first,5
teacher:Penelope what would I do first,5
teacher:Penelope said you have 30 and whats our other one,5
teacher:What about my 62,5
teacher:How did I find out how many combinations I would have does anybody remember,5
teacher:But how do I know how many wrestling matches Im going to make,5
teacher:Or I did this quickly so Im not surprised you dont remember but how many digits do I have here,5
teacher:When were wrestling them what are we doing,5
teacher:Okay what is multiplication wrestling,5
teacher:What ever were we doing,5
teacher:What were we doing on Tuesday,5
teacher:10 plus six more is,5
teacher:Okay James whats your idea;student:Ive got an idea,5
teacher:And we were breaking 91 into what,5
teacher:90 and,5
teacher:one and over here for 50 and three we would it break that into;student:One,5
teacher:Right there where it says what are your team,5
teacher:What does 90 times 50 mean,5
teacher:Whatd you get,5
teacher:Whats nine times five,5
teacher:Whats nine times three,5
teacher:And how many zeros,5
teacher:Whats one times 50,5
teacher:And then what are we going to do over here,5
teacher:One times what,5
teacher:times three whats one times three;student:Three,5
teacher:What did we get as our answer,5
teacher:45 with how many zeros,5
teacher:How many zeros do I need here;student:Two,5
teacher:How many zeros do I have here,5
teacher:Do we know what four times two is,5
teacher:So we would start and,5
teacher:This is interesting which multiples of four are also multiples of eight,5
teacher:What pattern do you see,5
teacher:The numbers 15 24 25 and 40 are all multiples of what,5
teacher:Then is 57 a multiple of seven and how do we know,5
teacher:So Im going to do nine and 10 because nine times 10 is;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Lets see what do you think I should do,5
teacher:Now this is the product right what are the balloons called,5
teacher:Whats the biggest I can make,5
teacher:Six times two which is what,5
teacher:How many did Paul sell,5
teacher:How many did Paul sell,5
teacher:How many Did Paul sell,5
teacher:How many did Paul sell,5
teacher:Matteo whats your answer,5
teacher:Whats next;student:Nine,5
teacher:Whats the first multiple of nine,5
teacher:Can you give me the first five multiples of nine,5
teacher:Nathan whats the last one,5
teacher:What are you thinking what are multiples,5
teacher:David what do you think,5
teacher:After we figured out how to count by ones we probably started counting by;student:Yeah,5
teacher:So if were talking about multiples of two we would have,5
teacher:This is really two times one two times two two times three;student:Two four six eight 10 12,5
teacher:Could you give me multiples of five,5
teacher:Okay give me multiples of five,5
teacher:Tell me how you got 17,5
teacher:What are the first five multiples of seven,5
teacher:Okay before I hear your multiples I want to know what strategy you used how did you figure out what those numbers were going to be,5
teacher:Julia what did you do,5
teacher:Chloe what did you do,5
teacher:Ella what did you do,5
teacher:What factors do we have with multiples of seven,5
teacher:Whats next Eleanor,5
teacher:Whats next Julia,5
teacher:Ill give you a hint this one,5
teacher:So in this case its two times two and how much is that,5
teacher:Eight plus nine is,5
teacher:How many bookmarks did Paul sell,5
teacher:How long;student:Yes,5
teacher:So what times six equals 36,5
teacher:Six equals 36 James,5
teacher:What is our answer,5
teacher:Does anybody remember what were doing yesterday afternoon,5
teacher:Do you remember what we called it;student:Multiplication  multiplication,5
teacher:What did we call it yesterday,5
teacher:Aria what did we call it,5
teacher:What were we talking about;student:Yes,5
teacher:When we did extended multiplication checks,5
teacher:What if I gave you,5
teacher:Tell me how you solve this,5
teacher:How would you approach this,5
teacher:What would you do,5
teacher:Miguel what do you think,5
teacher:But how much is it worth,5
teacher:What is it;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Diegos line was how many times the length of Shares,5
teacher:Diegos line was how many times the length of Shares line,5
teacher:I know that nine times eight is,5
teacher:How many books did Daren read,5
teacher:How can I put those together;student:Yes,5
teacher:How could I put those together,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:How can I combine those figure something out,5
teacher:How could I combine that,5
teacher:How many did Paul sell,5
teacher:So we could take this information and we could replace this J with what,5
teacher:How many hours does it take,5
teacher:So what do we have here,5
teacher:Thats what,5
teacher:Tell me how long it takes to fly there;student:Yes,5
teacher:Owen what are you thinking,5
teacher:So four times three is,5
teacher:Diegos line was how many times as long as Shares,5
teacher:How much did he read,5
teacher:Penelope what do you think,5
teacher:Nathan you think you know my first combination,5
teacher:Okay so what is three times six,5
teacher:40 plus eight is,5
teacher:Now what,5
teacher:Whats that;student:Yeah but you forgot one question,5
teacher:So our question said how many eggs does she eat in a year;student:Oh,5
teacher:Valentina what do you think,5
teacher:What si 12 times 48,5
teacher:How many eggs is she eating in a year,5
teacher:What do we mean when I say equivalent fraction,5
teacher:What am I looking for,5
teacher:How else could you describe it huh,5
teacher:Can you give me an example of an equivalent fraction,5
teacher:Okay what would be something thats equivalent to one half;student:One half,5
teacher:Now if I asked you to find something that is equivalent to one half what might you do,5
teacher:Miguel what are you thinking,5
teacher:And what would you do to this Miguel,5
teacher:Whats four times two,5
teacher:Now what fraction do I have here,5
teacher:Whats four times 10,5
teacher:What did you do first,5
teacher:Okay whats your idea;student:I have one,5
teacher:So what is five times seven,5
teacher:What should we do there,5
teacher:Valentina what do you think,5
teacher:What is four times seven,5
teacher:Now what do we do,5
teacher:What do we do next,5
teacher:Toby do you think you know what we do,5
teacher:So whats 140 plus 28,5
teacher:How much in a dozen,5
teacher:How much in a dozen Natalie,5
teacher:And we want to know how many is she buying in a year,5
teacher:How many eggs in a year,5
teacher:How many eggs in a year,5
teacher:Lucy what are you thinking to start,5
teacher:Natalie what are you thinking,5
teacher:What do you see,5
teacher:Whats something you notice,5
teacher:Owen whats something you notice about the fractions,5
teacher:Yeah so if I multiply by three and I multiply by three what do I get;student:Yeah because triple means three,5
teacher:We made equivalent fractions by doing what,5
teacher:What if I did this,5
teacher:So were saying one half is equal to four not six four whats,5
teacher:What am I multiplying one half by to get four eighths,5
teacher:So what else do I write,5
teacher:Two times four is what;student:By fours,5
teacher:And one times four is,5
teacher:What did we multiply by;student:Four,5
teacher:What am I multiplying by right here,5
teacher:What am I multiplying by,5
teacher:Whatever I do to the bottom,5
teacher:Whatever I do to the bottom;student:Amazing,5
teacher:Whatever I do to the top;student:You do to the top,5
teacher:If I have the fraction one half and I want to make an equivalent fraction with the denominator 10 what would the numerator be,5
teacher:Think about how we could use this idea of tripled to make an equivalent fraction,5
teacher:What did we do;student:Yeah,5
teacher:We went from one piece to how many;student:No,5
teacher:Now James said Hey we doubled here what did we do here;student:Yep,5
teacher:What do you see Matteo,5
teacher:Alejandro what do you see;student:I see that on the tops its counting one two three,5
teacher:Nathan what do you notice,5
teacher:Audrey what do you notice;student:No,5
teacher:Yeah whats happening to my denominator,5
teacher:Tell me in words what happened,5
teacher:What did we do to go from one half to two fourths,5
teacher:Any ideas,5
teacher:How did we get two fourths out of one half,5
teacher:Ben what did we do,5
teacher:David how else could you explain it,5
teacher:What would you multiply two by to get four,5
teacher:What if I multiply one times two,5
teacher:What would I get,5
teacher:Okay whats that;student:So I figured out that really theres another cheat too,5
teacher:What if were saying one half is equal to three sixths,5
teacher:What did we do,5
teacher:What do you think were going to do,5
teacher:Danielle sells five tickets a day for how long,5
teacher:How much money does he have left,5
teacher:And our next;student:20 times five,5
teacher:Okay next;student:Seven times 90,5
teacher:Two times nine is;student:Yes,5
teacher:With how many zeros,5
teacher:Whats two times five,5
teacher:With how many zeros,5
teacher:Whats seven times nine,5
teacher:63 with how many zeros;student:Seven times nine 63,5
teacher:And seven times five,5
teacher:Now what,5
teacher:Zero zero zero and five gives us,5
teacher:Zero zero three and three;student:Five,5
teacher:Eight plus one is nine plus six is,5
teacher:15 and one plus one is,5
teacher:Because you dont know,5
teacher:Okay so we did 20 times 90 what would be our next combination,5
teacher:You did what;student:Two times nine,5
teacher:Now what,5
teacher:Okay what was next,5
teacher:Whats three times two,5
teacher:How many zeros,5
teacher:So whos next,5
teacher:Whos the five going to wrestle with,5
teacher:And then whos five going to wrestle,5
teacher:Do we know five times six;student:I already did the whole thing,5
teacher:Whats five times six;student:Mmhmm,5
teacher:David whats the first combination you did,5
teacher:Whats five times two,5
teacher:What am I forgetting;student:Zero,5
teacher:Six plus one is,5
teacher:Eight and three,5
teacher:All right how far did you get,5
teacher:Okay what was the first step the first thing you did;student:I got like the first step,5
teacher:What did you break 27 up to look like,5
teacher:And 95,5
teacher:Now what do we do,5
teacher:And then,5
teacher:Times what,5
teacher:Whats eight times four,5
teacher:What was good what couldve used a little bit of work,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:What about the last one,5
teacher:How much money will he have left after he buys the books,5
teacher:Mr Swanson orders six packages how much money will he have left after he buys the books,5
teacher:How much money will he have left after he buys the books,5
teacher:The number of what;student:You read a little bit too fast,5
teacher:So where would I go from here,5
teacher:How am I going to attack this problem,5
teacher:Charlie what do you think,5
teacher:Lucy what do you think,5
teacher:Im going to use my zeros trick because five times six is what,5
teacher:So how much money did he spend on books,5
teacher:So now what,5
teacher:Whats the next step,5
teacher:What kind of things did you notice when I were looking here,5
teacher:And five times four,5
teacher:Five times two is 10 with another zero gives me,5
teacher:Five times 20,5
teacher:With how many zeros;student:Mmhmm,5
teacher:Whats eight times nine,5
teacher:72 and how many zeros,5
teacher:Six times four,5
teacher:With,5
teacher:And whats six times nine;student:Zero,5
teacher:Can you walk me through;student:Yep,5
teacher:So we have the 80 times 40 and then what do we have,5
teacher:Geo whats the first thing we do bud,5
teacher:What does 24 get split up into;student:Thank you,5
teacher:And over here what do we do now;student:20 and four,5
teacher:Now what,5
teacher:And my very last one Stella;student:Five times 20,5
teacher:Whats one times two,5
teacher:How many zeros,5
teacher:Whats 10 times four,5
teacher:For 15 Geo what did you what were your two players,5
teacher:Number six Estrella,5
teacher:The picture also does a really  Well what do you notice about the picture,5
teacher:What was our missing denominator,5
teacher:But how could that have happened,5
teacher:This one youre also going to find that the misconception on your own but youre going to,5
teacher:What was the misconception,5
teacher:What was the misconception,5
teacher:What was the biggest misconception,5
teacher:How was your prediction correct,5
teacher:How was your prediction incorrect,5
teacher:What could this student do to make this constructed response better,5
teacher:What are they missing,5
teacher:What could they add,5
teacher:What could they do better,5
teacher:What are they asking you to do,5
teacher:What could the student do to make their response better,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:What does it mean;student:He didnt make any sense of what he meant of it got taller,5
teacher:How could that happen,5
teacher:It got taller,5
teacher:How could that have happened,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:Where else do you think you use this in your life,5
teacher:So where else do you think you revised relook at something and make changes,5
teacher:Where else,5
teacher:Where else do you revise,5
teacher:What did we do yesterday Or not yesterday but in day one of this lesson that were going to be able to look back on,5
teacher:We dont have a video but we have something else that we can look back on,5
teacher:Where was their mistake made,5
teacher:What is the misconception of this students work,5
teacher:What was the mistake in their rule,5
teacher:What was the mistake in their coordinate grid,5
teacher:What was the specific rule Jake needed,5
teacher:Jake wanted what,5
teacher:A larger,5
teacher:So lets just write down what we notice and pretend like we what would we do to help,5
teacher:What was the misconception,5
teacher:What could have been a mistake there,5
teacher:What is that,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:Yeah wheres his mathematical vocabulary;student:He didnt really add many mathematical words in his response,5
teacher:Whats the common denominator for number 1,5
teacher:4 x 3,5
teacher:3 12 minus 3,5
teacher:Whats the common denominator,5
teacher:Okay so what do we do,5
teacher:So it equals what;student:No,5
teacher:Common denominator for the last one;student:The answer is,5
teacher:And what was your answer,5
teacher:What was your answer for the last one,5
teacher:What do you notice about that picture,5
teacher:What do you notice about that picture,5
teacher:Yeah theyre all equal but what;student:That theyre all equal,5
teacher:What else do you notice,5
teacher:Al those represent what,5
teacher:They all represent what though,5
teacher:Okay whats the common denominator for number 1,5
teacher:Now what;student:Its just like on a Nintendo set,5
teacher:3 x 4,5
teacher:Okay 2 x 4,5
teacher:Okay for number 1 what was For number 1  what was the common denominator,5
teacher:So  before the answer so what did we need to multiply 12 to get 8,5
teacher:12 multiply 4 equals;student:Yes,5
teacher:Now what do we do with the 48;student:48,5
teacher:What was the common denominator,5
teacher:What was the common denominator,5
teacher:Okay so 4 x 4 is;student:Me,5
teacher:And then youre going to describe compare your prediction was it correct or incorrect,5
teacher:What do I do with 1620 and 520,5
teacher:16  5,5
teacher:Yeah because 20 goes into 20 how many times;student:I can do  multiplication,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:What do you need to multiple 4 by to get 12,5
teacher:What do you need to multiple 4 by to get 12,5
teacher:Whats 3 x 3,5
teacher:What do I do;student:No,5
teacher:How was your prediction incorrect,5
teacher:How was your prediction correct,5
teacher:What was your mistake,5
teacher:How many blocks is the school to the pool,5
teacher:Since we start at the origin what can we do;student:14 blocks,5
teacher:Since we start with the origin what can we do,5
teacher:So if I see threefifths plus onefourth I know thats going to be closest to which benchmark fraction,5
teacher:Which one,5
teacher:We have seveneights which is already close to what,5
teacher:Show me on your fingers;student:One whole,5
teacher:Seveneights is already really close to what,5
teacher:And we are subtracting fivesixths which is also really close to what,5
teacher:Show me on your fingers,5
teacher:So were subtracting a fraction thats really close to one from a fraction that is also really close to one what benchmark fraction do we think that is close to,5
teacher:What do you mean by that;student:Because it goes kind of close to two,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:Number one what do we think,5
teacher:Threefourths minus twotenths,5
teacher:Pool coordinates Hunter,5
teacher:Pool;student:Origin,5
teacher:Which is also called the;student:Oh,5
teacher:Coordinates for the school class,5
teacher:Is there a way we could find the blocks away the pizzeria is from the park entrance using the ordered pairs,5
teacher:Is there a way we can find out how far away they are from one another using the ordered pairs;student:Yes,5
teacher:Where is the ice cream shop,5
teacher:How many,5
teacher:What is the ordered pair for the library,5
teacher:Oh the ordered pair not the blocks yet;student:23,5
teacher:for the library;student:I respectfully disagree,5
teacher:So what are we going to do,5
teacher:for the library,5
teacher:Ice cream shop;student:I know,5
teacher:How many blocks away is the library from the ice cream shop,5
teacher:Explain,5
teacher:The fewest number of blocks it would take to get from the school to the pool,5
teacher:School to a pool,5
teacher:I need an ordered pair for both and the fewest number of blocks,5
teacher:What is my coordinates for the school,5
teacher:What about ice cream shop,5
teacher:What fraction,5
teacher:Graphing what,5
teacher:You can tell me whats our first ordered pair,5
teacher:What lesson does this remind you of where we did this;student:I will develop and apply a rule to enlarge a picture on the coordinate grid,5
teacher:What lesson does this remind you of,5
teacher:So what does that mean;student:So double x,5
teacher:If Helena uses her rule what do you think the new trapezoid will look like,5
teacher:What vocabulary words do you think I may need for this response,5
teacher:So what vocabulary words do you think we could use,5
teacher:If Amy uses her rule what do you think the new trapezoid will look like,5
teacher:So what vocabulary words do you think we could use in this response,5
teacher:Okay what else,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:Any other words you can think of,5
teacher:To the left or to the right;student:Yes because youre doubling the Xaxis so its just going to move it to the left and make it a little wider,5
teacher:How did seeing these sample answers help you improve your answers,5
teacher:How did you find points to improve your answers by looking at the sample answers,5
teacher:Amarilla where did you see areas of improvement in your own work,5
teacher:Hows our sailboat going to look on this coordinate grid,5
teacher:Whats that going to do to our sailboat,5
teacher:So if were doubling all these ordered pairs whats going to happen to our sailboat;student:Yeah,5
teacher:So What about doubling zero,5
teacher:Okay whats next,5
teacher:Whats next Ariana,5
teacher:Now what do we need to do to our two dots before we go any further,5
teacher:Whats next Mason,5
teacher:Next,5
teacher:Because what do they want us to do,5
teacher:What do they want us to do if theyre repeating an ordered pair,5
teacher:Whats our first ordered pair we should do for our original sailboat,5
teacher:What is the purpose of that,5
teacher:After 01 whats next,5
teacher:So if we go to new sailboat number one it says rule what is our rule,5
teacher:What is our rule when we are manipulating,5
teacher:What is our rule,5
teacher:So what does that mean double each number,5
teacher:What does that mean double,5
teacher:What are you noticing for the first few examples,5
teacher:The purpose of repeating an ordered pair,5
teacher:How many blocks away did we say the park entrance was from the pizzeria,5
teacher:Theyre all equal to,5
teacher:Does anyone have an extra fifth which is what color,5
teacher:Now we need to fold it into what,5
teacher:How many of these fourths do we need to color in,5
teacher:So how many squares do we have in all,5
teacher:How many squares do we have in all;student:We have 12,5
teacher:How many did we color in dark,5
teacher:And then I need to do what,5
teacher:So Ive done fourths now I need to do,5
teacher:And how many are we coloring dark,5
teacher:So we would have our one fourth colored in still but instead of,5
teacher:What part of the liter did Carolyn drink;student:Oh okay,5
teacher:True or false,5
teacher:So its what SS,5
teacher:True or false SS;student:Is greater than 6 and 79100,5
teacher:Six and onetenth is less than six and 99100,5
teacher:True or false,5
teacher:So how many are we coloring lightly,5
teacher:What does product mean,5
teacher:Okay how many of these fourths do we have,5
teacher:How much of the whole pizza did Nolan eat,5
teacher:So much of the whole granola bar is he giving to his brother;student:Four,5
teacher:What part of the half fruit bar are we trying to find,5
teacher:So what part of the fruit bar are we trying to find from the beginning,5
teacher:What part of the half were we trying to find;student:We were trying to find the other half of the half so one fourth,5
teacher:When we folded it the first time what part of the half were we trying to find,5
teacher:How much of the whole veggie pizza did she eat,5
teacher:So first how much of the veggie pizza does Ava have,5
teacher:How much of the whole pizza did she eat,5
teacher:So first what do we need to do with our paper;student:So has half of the veggie pizza,5
teacher:How many of these pieces did she eat,5
teacher:So Im only going to color in dark how many pieces,5
teacher:So how may pieces of the whole pizza did she eat;student:Yessity yes,5
teacher:No I just said how many pieces of the whole pizza did she eat;student:Two thirds,5
teacher:How many pieces of pizza were there in the whole pizza,5
teacher:In the whole pizza,5
teacher:So you should have one third times one half equals what,5
teacher:Who can tell me again what does product mean,5
teacher:What does product mean,5
teacher:To a what kind of problem,5
teacher:And then explain what,5
teacher:What do you notice about the numerator and denominator and the picture,5
teacher:What do you notice,5
teacher:What do you notice about the denominator,5
teacher:What do you mean,5
teacher:What do you mean theres nine squares,5
teacher:How many brownies did he eat in all,5
teacher:What are the dimensions of the large square,5
teacher:So we know What is the area of our large square,5
teacher:We know the area of our large square is Is what,5
teacher:So now what are the dimensions of the shaded rectangle;student:Think of it kind of as like,5
teacher:We know the dimensions of this shaded rectangle because its what,5
teacher:What is the area of the shaded rectangle,5
teacher:What is the area of the shaded rectangle,5
teacher:So what was our final product,5
teacher:Lillian will you come up and show your whiteboard,5
teacher:How many thirds do I fill in,5
teacher:So how do I split my paper first,5
teacher:Into what,5
teacher:Colton what does product mean;student:A multiplication problem,5
teacher:Turn and tell your knee to knee partner what is the definition of a product;student:Its an answer to a multiplication problem,5
teacher:What do you notice,5
teacher:Or if you dont notice anything what do you wonder,5
teacher:Either two questions or two noticings,5
teacher:What do you notice,5
teacher:Were either asking questions or what do we notice,5
teacher:How many squares are there in all;student:One,5
teacher:So questions you have or what do you notice,5
teacher:Did anyone write down a noticing,5
teacher:What did you notice,5
teacher:Anything else;student:I notices that thirds and fifths are,5
teacher:What do you notice about the double shaded parts;student:I noticed that,5
teacher:What do you notice,5
teacher:So our first fold if we were going to fold we would need to fold into what,5
teacher:If we had a piece of paper,5
teacher:Turn to your Eagle partner and share your questions or share your noticings but dont erase,5
teacher:How many squares did we color in dark,5
teacher:What part of the fruit bar will Larry give to his brother,5
teacher:Whats our answer;student:Eight,5
teacher:Hadley number one,5
teacher:Number two Kate;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Number three;student:You left computer on,5
teacher:What do you notice in this picture,5
teacher:What do you notice,5
teacher:Yeah so how many;student:Yeah,5
teacher:If youre doing four times 26 how many 26 do you see,5
teacher:What are they doing instead of multiplying;student:Four,5
teacher:In number one our rule is what,5
teacher:What is the rule,5
teacher:What about 20,5
teacher:Whats 20 Eli,5
teacher:35;student:Four,5
teacher:10,5
teacher:Who would like to share the rule;student:Yessetyyes,5
teacher:Round 78105 to the nearest hundredths,5
teacher:Round 882186 to the nearest hundredths,5
teacher:Three point;student:No that one,5
teacher:Round 318 to the nearest tenth,5
teacher:And then dark blue is;student:I have two greens,5
teacher:Dark blue,5
teacher:35  15 using your fraction circles,5
teacher:Can you solve 12  14 using your fraction circles,5
teacher:Okay what is our common denominator,5
teacher:How many 12s goes into 13  14,5
teacher:Can you do what we did with 12  14,5
teacher:Whats the rule for number two Nate,5
teacher:Who has the answer;student:So 12  14,5
teacher:Read this number correctly,5
teacher:To the nearest;student:373,5
teacher:What in this number is a whole number,5
teacher:What in this number is the whole number,5
teacher:Is this three going to round the 87 to an 88 or keep it an 87,5
teacher:Round 9912 to the nearest tenth,5
teacher:Is the two going to round that one up or keep it the same,5
teacher:Who has the answer;student:Not me,5
teacher:Theyre all split in what,5
teacher:The rule was what;student:The rule,5
teacher:Next;student:Three,5
teacher:So whats different,5
teacher:Whats different,5
teacher:Whats different,5
teacher:Have we done a fraction of a fraction yet,5
teacher:What do you notice about number one,5
teacher:What do you notice about number one,5
teacher:One half of three over one would be three over two which is then what,5
teacher:What about this,5
teacher:What about two,5
teacher:What about number two,5
teacher:How do we solve,5
teacher:How do we solve a fraction of a fraction,5
teacher:Whats three times three,5
teacher:Three times one,5
teacher:Two times four;student:Three,5
teacher:Between a half and one,5
teacher:So here right here would be one fourth what would be close to what fraction would be here,5
teacher:What did you notice about this,5
teacher:Okay how is this the same;student:Could you do that,5
teacher:What do you notice,5
teacher:What do you notice Skyler,5
teacher:What do you notice,5
teacher:What did you notice about one and two,5
teacher:What did you notice about one and two Nolan,5
teacher:What do you mean by that;student:I noticed that theyre the same problem,5
teacher:What do you mean;student:You can do it the same way,5
teacher:Five so what was 15 class;student:The rule is divide by five,5
teacher:What do you mean;student:You can divide it the other way,5
teacher:Starting there 15 times three is,5
teacher:Next we have 20 over one which would be 20 times three is;student:Yes,5
teacher:Then 60 divided by five is,5
teacher:30 divided by five,5
teacher:This is what,5
teacher:This is what,5
teacher:What was I doing the whole time,5
teacher:15 times 3 is,5
teacher:What are the dimensions of the shaded Of the shaded rectangle,5
teacher:10 what;student:I respectfully disagree,5
teacher:Wheres the pizzeria at,5
teacher:Because when you said twelvetwelfths is the whole casserole so fourfourths is the whole what,5
teacher:What do you see Caleb,5
teacher:Come show us;student:I know how they got the threefourth and onethird because the,5
teacher:So what does the onethird represent,5
teacher:Talk about the casserole;student:The length of the,5
teacher:What does the onethird represent,5
teacher:Carson do you know what the onethird represents,5
teacher:whats the one third represent,5
teacher:So the question is how much did group B eat,5
teacher:So what are we left talking about,5
teacher:Whats left after group A eats Mia,5
teacher:Whats left after group A eats,5
teacher:Well how much is this;student:Threethirds,5
teacher:What fraction does this represent,5
teacher:Each of these is how much,5
teacher:It is the whole of what;student:A whole,5
teacher:So if onethird is all thats left how much of that did group B eat,5
teacher:What is the fourfourths what does that represent;student:Theres fourfourths,5
teacher:How much does she put in vase one,5
teacher:what do you think,5
teacher:what do you think,5
teacher:So then what this threetwelfths represents can you keep running with that Carson,5
teacher:Anybody have an answer to that;student:Yes why would you choose subtraction when you have addition and multiplication,5
teacher:What do you think Anna,5
teacher:Do you want to tell them what your,5
teacher:What is the  representing;student:My difference is that they subtracted the leftover to get the,5
teacher:Whats that last onetwelfth,5
teacher:But what was the question;student:But I think you should actually subtract those three too and have the one be your answer because thats the leftover so that would be the remainder of it,5
teacher:The question was how much,5
teacher:What do each of those fractions mean,5
teacher:I heard over here what does the onethird mean,5
teacher:Do you remember what Carson said about the threefourths,5
teacher:What does the threefourths stand for,5
teacher:What did you notice about the picture,5
teacher:Theres four what,5
teacher:And if were just talking about these pieces how many are there,5
teacher:So were talking about,5
teacher:How much of the whole casserole did group B take,5
teacher:How many dont think that Ella ate more,5
teacher:What does quotient mean,5
teacher:What does quotient mean,5
teacher:So what does largest quotient mean,5
teacher:What does it mean to justify,5
teacher:Justify a rule,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:What else would you want to hear,5
teacher:What is number one class,5
teacher:What is number two;student:100,5
teacher:What is number three;student:1000,5
teacher:Whats another way that you could write this;student:Because Problems like this we just add the amount of,5
teacher:Whats another way you could write this,5
teacher:Brendan what did you get,5
teacher:Mason whatd you get,5
teacher:Okay so how many of you think that Ella ate more,5
teacher:You divided what,5
teacher:Okay so who ate more carrots;student:This much,5
teacher:Okay so when you have solved this please tell your partner about what you think the answer is and how you would explain that your answer is correct,5
teacher:Of the;student:casserole,5
teacher:So if were talking about the size of the pieces the denominator has to be what,5
teacher:Theyre asking how much of the whole casserole did group B eat,5
teacher:Talk to your neighbor about what you see and you think,5
teacher:So I want you to show me in standard  what that number is,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:Times ten to the third,5
teacher:What might the threefourths be of,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:65 with four zeros which would be,5
teacher:What is that number called,5
teacher:So what is that number,5
teacher:What is this number,5
teacher:What was easy about that problem,5
teacher:Ten to the second power is what Landon,5
teacher:So I like what youre thinking Carson in terms of the threefourths what is the three fourths of;student:So thats what I thought they were thinking,5
teacher:Come on up you can come point at it too;student:I noticed that so,5
teacher:You can  do you want to come and point at it;student:What I noticed is that it kind of highlighted not highlighted but,5
teacher:So the length is one and width is one so whats the area;student:I just said,5
teacher:So we said the length of the left side is one unit the width is one unit so what is the area,5
teacher:So what are the dimensions of the shaded rectangle,5
teacher:The dimensions,5
teacher:So that means how long are the sides of the shaded rectangle,5
teacher:This whole length of the line is what;student:Thats,5
teacher:So whats the area of the shaded rectangle,5
teacher:So multiplication for the area of the shaded rectangle would be what,5
teacher:So there are one two three four so what fraction does each of these represent,5
teacher:And what would this be,5
teacher:What are the dimensions of the shaded rectangle,5
teacher:So whats the length of this side,5
teacher:How long is it that way,5
teacher:So the dimensions would be one fourth by what did you say,5
teacher:So then whats the area,5
teacher:Is one unit and what is the width,5
teacher:And we said what is the length,5
teacher:I think its one because one times one equals what,5
teacher:What do you think the area of this large square is,5
teacher:And the denominator is how many parts to what Tom,5
teacher:How many parts to,5
teacher:So I want you to talk to your neighbor and tell me whether is the product greater than or less than the factors,5
teacher:Is the product greater than or less than the factors,5
teacher:Alec is the product greater or less than two thirds,5
teacher:Or is the product greater or less than the factors,5
teacher:So which is bigger,5
teacher:Because there are how many pieces total,5
teacher:Two thirds or four ninths,5
teacher:So the point is what is included in each of the two thirds;student:Its hard to explain,5
teacher:What are the dimensions of the large square,5
teacher:For the large square what are the dimensions,5
teacher:What are the dimensions,5
teacher:So what do you see up here,5
teacher:So the dimensions are what,5
teacher:So whats the area of the large square,5
teacher:Kevin do you have a different explanation,5
teacher:Noah last one what did you get,5
teacher:And then one fourth times three fourths;student:And then,5
teacher:So what are the dimensions of the shaded area,5
teacher:Can somebody describe it in terms of the area model,5
teacher:And then how would you know what the numerator would be,5
teacher:Talk to your neighbor about what you think the numerator would be and how to explain it based on the area model,5
teacher:Talk about the area model,5
teacher:Any explanation based on the area model,5
teacher:How would you come up with the explanation that the numerator is going to be 10,5
teacher:We know its going to be 10 but how,5
teacher:So what is the denominator going to be on this,5
teacher:And then whats the numerator,5
teacher:what was the third part of what you needed to do,5
teacher:So how much of the whole casserole did group B take,5
teacher:So lets talk about what do you see,5
teacher:Talk to your neighbors what do you notice about what they did,5
teacher:Okay so would anybody like to share what they noticed,5
teacher:What did you notice about the picture,5
teacher:So what is the denominator going to be,5
teacher:How many parts are there going to be,5
teacher:And before you draw your area model what do you think its going to look like,5
teacher:So what does the 15 represent,5
teacher:So what is the answer to this problem,5
teacher:And the denominator is what did you say,5
teacher:So what is it,5
teacher:Whatd you get,5
teacher:You got what,5
teacher:And with your partner I want you to talk about what does the numerator represent,5
teacher:Tell what the numerator represents,5
teacher:So the multiplication numbers  so this would be one fourth times,5
teacher:The numerator,5
teacher:Matt whats the answer to this problem,5
teacher:And what does the three represent,5
teacher:What does the numerator represent,5
teacher:But what does that mean,5
teacher:And the 15 represents what,5
teacher:Parts it takes to what;student:Parts,5
teacher:How many parts it takes to,5
teacher:And then I want you to discuss with your partner what the denominator means,5
teacher:What ordered pair is the pizzeria,5
teacher:Nolan number one,5
teacher:Laura last one,5
teacher:Does anyone know,5
teacher:What numbers are halfway between these two numbers,5
teacher:What numbers would be in the thousandths place between those two,5
teacher:What would come after this one that would be halfway between these two numbers,5
teacher:Whats our halfway,5
teacher:Whats our halfway number,5
teacher:So what would be our halfway mark,5
teacher:Whats our halfway mark,5
teacher:So whats going to be on the first part of our number line,5
teacher:What did you get Mason,5
teacher:What did you get Hunter,5
teacher:Whats 12 divided by four,5
teacher:Whats 20 divided by four class;student:Three,5
teacher:Turn to your partner and solve these last two problems,5
teacher:Whats one times 10,5
teacher:So now its asking us what number is exactly halfway between the numbers that we wrote,5
teacher:Whats three times one;student:10,5
teacher:So are we closer to filling in this square or are we closer to this yellow square,5
teacher:So if the one becomes a two thatd be 3 and 60,5
teacher:What do you mean by that;student:Because its more than 5 or greater than five,5
teacher:What part,5
teacher:What part of 28 hundredths is greater than five,5
teacher:That eight what;student:The eight,5
teacher:So really how many hundredths were we away from three,5
teacher:How many hundredths were we away from three,5
teacher:Show me on your fingers,5
teacher:Whats next,5
teacher:What is the price of a gallon of gas rounded to the nearest cent or hundredth of dollar,5
teacher:So what can we tell our parents,5
teacher:What can we tell our parents,5
teacher:What do we need to tell them they need to do,5
teacher:What can we tell them to do,5
teacher:So how much is the gas going to cost them Eli,5
teacher:So that would mean 3 and;student:So that 500 would go to two,5
teacher:Now are we closer to three and 61 hundredths or are we closer to three and 62 hundredths,5
teacher:Right now what is this,5
teacher:How many times does three go into 10,5
teacher:Because three times three is what;student:I think that the remainder would be a third,5
teacher:Where is Wicklow;student:I dont know where that stuff,5
teacher:Westport,5
teacher:Westport,5
teacher:What do you notice about this picture;student:I can play hidden treasures to practice plotting points on a coordinate grid,5
teacher:How many is that,5
teacher:How many is that,5
teacher:What is the fewest number of blocks Ben will have to walk to get to the grocery store,5
teacher:Who has an idea,5
teacher:Who has an idea,5
teacher:Who remembers what this is called,5
teacher:What vocabulary word is this,5
teacher:Where is the park entrance at,5
teacher:What ordered pair,5
teacher:What ordered pair is the park entrance at,5
teacher:What is the ordered pair of the park entrance,5
teacher:Where is Wicklow,5
teacher:You and your partner find the coordinates to Westport and then,5
teacher:Westport and Wicklow,5
teacher:Now we must find Westport and Wicklow and you must put the coordinates,5
teacher:If I had 10 10 what;student:And then the remainder would be one third because the remainder would be one but then we convert it into a fraction,5
teacher:What could I have 10 of,5
teacher:One times five is,5
teacher:Four times one is;student:Five,5
teacher:How many times does four go into five;student:Four,5
teacher:Where is it;student:T Ive found it,5
teacher:Tell me when you find E8,5
teacher:So is 28 hundredths closer to two tenths or three tenths,5
teacher:E8,5
teacher:When you find what is at E8 raise your hand and point to it on your map,5
teacher:E8 and point,5
teacher:E8 and point,5
teacher:E8 and point,5
teacher:E8 and point,5
teacher:What is at E8,5
teacher:E8;student:Darey is at E8,5
teacher:Tell me what is at E8,5
teacher:You tape it,5
teacher:Zachary you want to come and tape,5
teacher:For 28 hundredths I needed to shade in what,5
teacher:How many times does three go into 16;student:16,5
teacher:Three times five;student:Five,5
teacher:So what do I subtract from 16,5
teacher:Three times five is;student:Five,5
teacher:So what do I subtract from 16;student:15,5
teacher:And then what becomes my denominator;student:15,5
teacher:So what number would I want to put right here;student:65 divided by 4,5
teacher:Six plus five is;student:Four,5
teacher:Four goes into 11 how many times show me on your fingers,5
teacher:Closest to 11,5
teacher:Four times two is what;student:97 divided by three is 32 and a third,5
teacher:11 minus eight is;student:Eight,5
teacher:And whats my denominator;student:Three,5
teacher:So who would be the winner of the cards;student:Four,5
teacher:What about improper fraction,5
teacher:And then nine plus seven is,5
teacher:Show how do you decided where to place the cards to build the larger fraction,5
teacher:A mixed,5
teacher:And you might divide out the fraction and create a large quotient but you might create what,5
teacher:So lets start with how did you arrange your numbers,5
teacher:What did you put for the dividend,5
teacher:Ariana what did you put for the dividend,5
teacher:So what did you put for the divisor,5
teacher:What was the quotient,5
teacher:So how do you think Harriet should place her number to get the largest possible quotient,5
teacher:And what is quotient,5
teacher:What about mixed number,5
teacher:What is a quotient,5
teacher:What other words you want to use in your constructed response,5
teacher:Have you ever done your division problem in a different way,5
teacher:Well you could but as a frac,5
teacher:So you could use vocabulary words such as;student:Tion,5
teacher:Such as,5
teacher:As you can see youll create a what,5
teacher:Improper,5
teacher:What other vocabulary words do you want to use in your constructed response,5
teacher:Faith number two,5
teacher:You want to share something you recognize from this picture,5
teacher:What does expanded form mean Connor,5
teacher:Two what Hunter,5
teacher:So I need to fill in what,5
teacher:Two,5
teacher:So now what Skyler four what,5
teacher:So this one I would color in what;student:I love top it,5
teacher:Tyler would you like to come color it in,5
teacher:What if I did You guys want to do that one,5
teacher:You want to try,5
teacher:Oh which ones greater;student:I meant which ones greater,5
teacher:Kate would you like to try;student:600,5
teacher:Can you try this one,5
teacher:What do you think you would do if its at five,5
teacher:28 28 what,5
teacher:Closer to two tenths or three tenths;student:Hundredths,5
teacher:So first I needed to shade in what,5
teacher:Two what,5
teacher:Okay what do I do first,5
teacher:Who can read this decimal,5
teacher:Who can guide me,5
teacher:Can anyone read those decimals,5
teacher:Number two Mason,5
teacher:Number one Kate,5
teacher:Number two Ariana,5
teacher:Which is greater,5
teacher:Dont say anything 34 what would I say,5
teacher:34,5
teacher:What does expanded form mean,5
teacher:Hundredths or 248 class;student:34 thousandths hundredths,5
teacher:Who else can explain;student:Because theyre going to be bigger pieces,5
teacher:So already which ones bigger,5
teacher:Does anyone know how many this has on it,5
teacher:Where can you see on this chart which is the larger number;student:Eight,5
teacher:What place value,5
teacher:What place value Kate,5
teacher:How would we fill this in,5
teacher:Okay 34 what;student:Im pretty sure its 34,5
teacher:So what would our fraction be,5
teacher:Show me vertical horizontal vertical horizontal vertical horizontal vertical horizontal horizontal vertical horizontal vertical horizontal vertical vertical vertical horizontal vertical vertical,5
teacher:How should we label these tick marks,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:When you look at the two different problems what is the difference,5
teacher:What is the differencebetween one and two in the problem only,5
teacher:Angelina what is the difference,5
teacher:How many of these do we have Clyde,5
teacher:How many hands will I have full of cubes,5
teacher:So if I had seven of these little cubes and I put them in piles how many piles will I have,5
teacher:So if I had eight piles with seven in there how many total little cubes do I have;student:Eight,5
teacher:So explain to me what our problem would look like in this one,5
teacher:So Id have how many of these;student:Instead of just seven in each handful youd have 70,5
teacher:So that is how many,5
teacher:How many piles do I have,5
teacher:So what is different,5
teacher:If our piles arent different whats different,5
teacher:Which is what in the problem,5
teacher:Ricky what do you think,5
teacher:Whats different,5
teacher:Caspien what do you think,5
teacher:56 plus zero is,5
teacher:Ricky what would I ask you to do,5
teacher:What do you mean by times tables;student:Uh practice your times tables,5
teacher:Youre absolutely right but what do you mean by that,5
teacher:Can anybody think about what weve been calling them in class;student:One times five,5
teacher:Yes but whats on that multiplication time test;student:multiplication time test,5
teacher:So then what does that word mean,5
teacher:So what do you think extended means,5
teacher:Five quintillion times,5
teacher:What is the answer to that very long and complicated multiplication problem;student:Zero,5
teacher:It doesnt matter how big this is zero times all these zeros is going to be zero but then when we get all the way out here to the quadrillions zero times three is still,5
teacher:You all know the answer because this is the one I made you write a 100 times class what is the answer,5
teacher:Whats seven times eight,5
teacher:Whats zero times eight,5
teacher:What do you mean no,5
teacher:How can I be wrong,5
teacher:Whatchu talking about willis;student:No,5
teacher:So then how is it different,5
teacher:Were counting up by what,5
teacher:Without the zero what answer do we get,5
teacher:You may start wherever you would like to start in this problem but you just have to tell us how and what you did,5
teacher:So what answer did you get Mr Francis,5
teacher:Whats wrong with it,5
teacher:Whats wrong with I dog,5
teacher:So now that Ms Annabelle has this number sentence up there for us Annabelle can you solve that,5
teacher:What is six times five Ms AnnabelleCount up by fives six times,5
teacher:And whats missing,5
teacher:Whats eight times five,5
teacher:All right please tell me the answer to this one everybody,5
teacher:Who knows what six times seven is,5
teacher:What is seven times six Crosby,5
teacher:Beautiful and Mr Crosby how many zeros do we have in the problem,5
teacher:In the number 63 what is my six worth,5
teacher:Dash in the number 63 what is my six worth;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Hadleys first number is 43 Honour what is her four worth,5
teacher:Nine times 400 how many zeros,5
teacher:And how many zeros Caspien,5
teacher:Who can tell me what nine time four is,5
teacher:And how many zeros do we have Finely,5
teacher:Francis whats seven times eight,5
teacher:What are the first two digits of your answer,5
teacher:So as I stated Clyde what are my first two numbers of my answer going to be,5
teacher:So how many zeros do I have in my problem total,5
teacher:Guess how many zeros have to go in my answer,5
teacher:All right so whats something anybody notices about those top two problems in the examples,5
teacher:Carrington what do you see,5
teacher:Anybody want to raise their hand and give me a reasonable answer without blurting;student:Basic multiplication,5
teacher:Any other noticings,5
teacher:Does anybody notice things in the other one,5
teacher:So its going 8 32 64 and so what about the fives,5
teacher:How many is that going up each time,5
teacher:Who can tell what eight times four is,5
teacher:And Analies how many zeros do we have if we take this one and multiply it by this one,5
teacher:Were no longer multiplying by eight what are we multiplying by,5
teacher:So we take nine times 70 Who can tell me what nine times seven is;student:Nine,5
teacher:How about the other one,5
teacher:So when I say multiplication facts when I tell you to practice your multiplication facts what should you be practicing,5
teacher:Ezra what do multiplication facts mean,5
teacher:Beautiful which is;student:We going to have to divide 20 by five,5
teacher:Anson are they getting larger or smaller;student:Smaller,5
teacher:Emmerson which two operations do we have to use,5
teacher:What number are we dealing with,5
teacher:So if I have 20 going into the ear and I would like to get five coming out of the mouth if I were to subtract what would I get,5
teacher:What number would I have to subtract from 20 to equal five Aldo,5
teacher:Five times what number equals 20,5
teacher:We now know that we are going to be dividing by,5
teacher:Four times what equals 12 Aldo,5
teacher:Ember whats my rule,5
teacher:If I put four into the ear and I divide it by four what will come out of the mouth,5
teacher:What is four divided by four,5
teacher:Any number divided by itself is always going to give you Amaya,5
teacher:So if we put 28 into the ear and we divide it by four what will come out of the mouth,5
teacher:So four times what number will give us 28,5
teacher:So 28 divided by four is,5
teacher:So are the numbers going in the ear coming out of the mouth getting larger or getting smaller,5
teacher:How many clues do we have Adeline,5
teacher:So simply subtract six from nine and what do we get;student:Subtraction,5
teacher:So if weve been adding whats the opposite of adding,5
teacher:So the question we have to ask ourselves is how do we know which one is going to be used,5
teacher:So on our second clue what number are we putting in this time,5
teacher:What number do we want to get out;student:Four,5
teacher:So how can we get from a four to a 10,5
teacher:No because whats four times two;student:No,5
teacher:So that leaves us with what,5
teacher:If were going to add six if I add six and four what do I get,5
teacher:Who havent I heard from Aisha what is my answer going to be,5
teacher:If I add six and six what do I get,5
teacher:So were going to start at the top of our in and out box and what number needs to go into the ear Aisha,5
teacher:If I put in two and I add six whats going to come out of its mouth,5
teacher:Whats going to come out of its mouth,5
teacher:If I put a five into the robots ear what am I going to get out,5
teacher:What number did they give us,5
teacher:The number thats going into the robot or the number thats coming out of the robot Avery,5
teacher:So the question now is what number would we have to put into its ear to get nine to come out of its mouth,5
teacher:What is our operation going to be,5
teacher:What is that three actually worth,5
teacher:Guys what youre asking yourself is what number do we multiply by four to equal 36,5
teacher:What number of times for gives you 36,5
teacher:How will we know if it works,5
teacher:What happens if we apply both of our options to our second clue,5
teacher:Please try to get from eight to 40 using plus 12 and times five and tell me what happens,5
teacher:Tell me what happens when you add 12 to eight and then when you multiply eight times five what happens,5
teacher:What happens when you do those two things,5
teacher:So tell me what happens,5
teacher:What about the other one,5
teacher:If you do addition then;student:So if you do addition its,5
teacher:Because what do I have to get out of the mouth;student:No it doesnt work,5
teacher:But what did I get out of the mouth;student:You need to get 40,5
teacher:So now that we know what is our rule Ailani what is our rule going to be,5
teacher:What is that rule going to be Emmerson;student:12 plus 12,5
teacher:I chose five by the way because you should all know your fives Ember whats coming out of the mouth,5
teacher:Aaron what comes out,5
teacher:So Elliot what are we going to have to do to figure this out,5
teacher:Elliot what,5
teacher:So where do we have to go to figure out which one is correct,5
teacher:We going to have to do what;student:Were going to use whatever,5
teacher:So Amaya how are we going to determine which one of those is correct,5
teacher:So if this was an in and out box that you guys had to solve on a test where would we start,5
teacher:Mr Ember where would you start my friend,5
teacher:Mr Ember once you have that robot drawn out what are you going to do,5
teacher:So why dont you walk me through Mr Ember what you would do to do so,5
teacher:So Ember says were going to look at the clue which clue do you want to use Ember;student:look at the clue,5
teacher:So what am I going to do with that clue Mr Ember,5
teacher:So what number is going into the ear of the robot,5
teacher:Or if youre going to division the proper thing is 36 divided by what number divided by four well give you what number,5
teacher:But how did you know we arent subtracting here;student:Itd be Emmerson to come up to give you 15,5
teacher:What other number do we already know in the robot,5
teacher:What other number do we already know and where does that belong,5
teacher:And if we are going to add Miss Ansona what will we have to add in order to get 15 out of the mouth,5
teacher:What is our other option,5
teacher:What is our other option here Van,5
teacher:And if we multiply what are we going to multiply by,5
teacher:Now we need to determine well which one is it,5
teacher:What do I still have to do Mr Ace,5
teacher:How do we know which one were going to use,5
teacher:Looking at my second number 62 who can tell me the two numbers I need to put together to make the number 62,5
teacher:On the left side how many do I have,5
teacher:The body but what would you call that;student:The body,5
teacher:So if you followed your arrows and you did 200 times five which is what Or 200 times 40 what youre going to start with what would 240 be called,5
teacher:When you write them down,5
teacher:What are those,5
teacher:What are they,5
teacher:A factor or two factors;student:A factor,5
teacher:Tell us what youre doing though,5
teacher:Talk to us let us know,5
teacher:What are you doing,5
teacher:So what are you going to do in number two,5
teacher:Whats another way of saying that,5
teacher:Tell us what youre going to do now,5
teacher:Then what,5
teacher:Okay what are you going to do now Jimmy,5
teacher:And then what;student:Yeah,5
teacher:What would they actually be;student:No,5
teacher:Mr Jimmy now what are you going to do,5
teacher:So Ms Elaina what are you going to do now,5
teacher:But can we think of a better way to say the largest numbers,5
teacher:Where did I mess up,5
teacher:Where did I mess up Mr Harry where did I mess up;student:Oh I see it,5
teacher:Whats six plus three Harry,5
teacher:Plus one;student:Nine,5
teacher:Whats five plus one Harry,5
teacher:Whats wrong clearly I made a mistake,5
teacher:So what did I do wrong Avah,5
teacher:Who wins,5
teacher:So what did you do,5
teacher:What number would you get if you added them,5
teacher:What do you mean;student:Each,5
teacher:So Jamie walk us through what you mean and have explain it to Anna so she can show everybody what youre talking about,5
teacher:So start at the 200 and do what,5
teacher:How do we show that visually;student:And multiply it by 40,5
teacher:You can show it with what,5
teacher:So then what do we do,5
teacher:What are you going to do,5
teacher:Tell us,5
teacher:What do you get when you multiply five times four,5
teacher:What was your answer for 2C or 2B,5
teacher:Whatd you get for 2B,5
teacher:What did you come up with two wholes,5
teacher:What shape did you get for two wholes,5
teacher:So if a triangle is onethird whats one whole,5
teacher:Whats threethirds,5
teacher:But then what about fivethirds,5
teacher:Does anybody know what fivethirds looked like,5
teacher:What two shapes made up fivethirds,5
teacher:Can you do it with just two shapes;student:Fivethirds would be a trapezoid and two triangles,5
teacher:Emerie what was the answer for four,5
teacher:What is our missing denominator,5
teacher:Esme what did you get for number four,5
teacher:What is our missing denominator,5
teacher:What about number five,5
teacher:If we know that twothirds is a rhombus and onethird is a triangle what was one whole,5
teacher:But what was one whole,5
teacher:So Mr Johnny if twothirds is a rhombus what is onethird,5
teacher:Two big squares with four squares in it so a total of how many little squares,5
teacher:And how many zeros,5
teacher:Whats my problem then if you got it right,5
teacher:All right Mr Jean what now,5
teacher:All right Mr Jalen what are you going to do,5
teacher:So what is it,5
teacher:Whats the problem,5
teacher:So what should the answer be,5
teacher:My final one four times one,5
teacher:Six times four Mr Jalen,5
teacher:What is the valuable lesson,5
teacher:Who can tell me what one and a half looks like,5
teacher:Leon what does one and a half look like,5
teacher:Then what does a half look like;student:Yeah,5
teacher:What does it look like;student:Half of the whole thing,5
teacher:Describe your picture,5
teacher:All right and then what does two look like Elyse,5
teacher:So what is the valuable lesson here,5
teacher:How many zeros;student:Nine times five is 45,5
teacher:Nine times five Aubriella,5
teacher:Whats 70 times one,5

teacher:How many zeros,5
teacher:What is six times two Honour,5
teacher:Daniela how many zeros are there in that problem,5
teacher:On the right side how many do I have,5
teacher:What are her two tens places Aubriella,5
teacher:If were going to do the same thing for Hadleys side what two numbers will Hadley use,5
teacher:Youre 100 correct but how do we know;student:And like Hadleys numbers  between 63 and 62,5
teacher:Whats Hadley going to get,5
teacher:Briana what is Hadley going to get on that other side,5
teacher:Were going to start with three times,5
teacher:What if I made a mistake,5
teacher:What does that leave us with,5
teacher:Weve multiplied everything together except what,5
teacher:Look at my numbers what is left to multiply,5
teacher:Whats left to multiply Enzo,5
teacher:In my case Ford what am I going to multiply,5
teacher:Ariana what is Hadley going to multiply,5
teacher:In our ones place,5

teacher:What operations can we use to make a number get bigger,5
teacher:Alexia what two operations can we use to make a number get bigger,5
teacher:Lower than what;student:I think its less than threefourths because if you find something like a half or even lower,5
teacher:Threefourths times seveneighths is greater than or less than threefourths,5
teacher:What do we know about seveneighths,5
teacher:What do we know about seveneighths,5
teacher:How do we know just looking,5
teacher:Who can give me the vocabulary that goes with number one as well,5

teacher:So whats the question we are answering;student:Six,5
teacher:Class what is the question we are answering,5
teacher:What is the question we are answering,5
teacher:Okay so how much money;student:How much money did he spend on comic books,5
teacher:Were multiplying by a factor that is what;student:We wont get a bigger problem because its lower than one,5
teacher:Okay now turn and talk to your partner about D What do you think the answer is going to me,5
teacher:Well one half is less than one so our product is going to be Miles;student:Five,5
teacher:Unlike five because a half is less than,5
teacher:Who would like to do B,5
teacher:What are the dimensions of the shaded rectangle,5
teacher:C,5
teacher:Now what is the struggle with number one,5
teacher:What do you notice about number one,5
teacher:What do you have to do with number one that you havent had to do,5
teacher:That you havent had to do on your own yet,5
teacher:What is our numerator;student:See if you can find it,5
teacher:What have we shaded in dark,5
teacher:Three times two;student:24,5
teacher:Who can give me an example of an equivalent fraction for 14,5
teacher:Who can give me a different one,5
teacher:What do you mean,5
teacher:How did you get 2  8,5
teacher:Who can explain how you got 28,5
teacher:Okay Hadley go fill out my tick marks,5
teacher:Who thinks they could fill out the tick marks for me,5
teacher:Four times four is;student:Three,5
teacher:How many squares do you see in all of the squares,5
teacher:How should we label,5
teacher:How should we label these,5
teacher:Show me horizontal,5
teacher:So thats also going to be what class,5
teacher:So its shaded up to what,5
teacher:Its shaded up to what horizontally,5
teacher:Horizontally where is it shaded too,5
teacher:What do these represent,5
teacher:What are the dimensions of the shaded rectangle,5
teacher:Which means,5
teacher:Which means we have to do,5
teacher:How many squares are shaded in in all,5

teacher:How many squares are shaded in in all,5
teacher:How many squares do you see shaded in Skyler,5
teacher:How many squares are there in all;student:Three,5
teacher:What is the area of the shaded rectangle;student:Three fourths,5
teacher:21 minus 16,5
teacher:What does 33 represent,5
teacher:What do those represent,5
teacher:Whats half of five,5
teacher:Okay five times 12 so we would do 51 times 12 equals 52  which would then equal,5
teacher:Because I know five times one is what,5
teacher:Where I look at B whats going to be greater,5
teacher:Which ones going to be greater,5
teacher:What do you think for B,5
teacher:What happens when you multiply a number thats less than one,5
teacher:What happens to your product,5
teacher:It becomes what Nolan,5
teacher:Okay C What do you notice about C,5
teacher:C what do you notice and whats your reasoning,5
teacher:Whats your reasoning Leah,5
teacher:What do you notice and whats your reasoning,5
teacher:Wait you mean four is more than;student:So there was a six and four and I knew that that was more than five because six is more than five so,5
teacher:So 54 is greater than what;student:Five times one normally would be five and there would still be 1 point left and it would be54 would be greater,5
teacher:If I said give me half of five give me half of that,5
teacher:Whats a half of five;student:No,5
teacher:Do we think five times 12 is going to be greater than five,5
teacher:What do we think,5
teacher:How much pizza do I have,5
teacher:Every time I multiply 22  33 44 Im multiplying by,5
teacher:How did you get 15 over 24,5

teacher:Whats six times 3 SS;student:I think 35,5
teacher:Six times seven,5
teacher:Okay so what did we talk about,5
teacher:What is  33 the same as multiplying by what,5
teacher:33 is the same as multiplying by what,5
teacher:If I said I have 33 of a pizza I have what of pizza,5
teacher:A so we have five times 12 is greater than or less than a five,5
teacher:What do we think,5
teacher:Okay whats eight times seven,5
teacher:Okay 7 times 2,5
teacher:Number two Janelle,5
teacher:What about the last one,5
teacher:What do you have to do,5
teacher:So we can do four minus two is what everybody,5
teacher:So we have two thirds and two minus one is;student:Two,5
teacher:So Lily what you are looking for  whats it called that we just did here,5
teacher:is a type of;student:trade first then subtract,5
teacher:talk to your shoulder partner about how you would estimate please,5
teacher:Talk about how you would estimate inaudible;student:crosstalk,5
teacher:Can I get a volunteer to share how they estimated for number three,5
teacher:How do you estimate for number three William,5
teacher:What about number four for an estimate,5
teacher:What about estimate from number four  Alex,5
teacher:But what about 13,5
teacher:What would 13rd be closest to,5
teacher:So a whole minus half is about what,5
teacher:Were going to end up with close,5
teacher:So what do you have to do,5
teacher:What do you call it when you have the same denominator;student:Theyre similar because they both have inauidble They have the same denominators,5
teacher:how we problem similar or different,5
teacher:Lily what do you think,5
teacher:Charlie would you please share where you put B on your number line,5
teacher:Okay tell me more;student:I agree with Nolan,5
teacher:How many yards of fabric does he have left,5

teacher:How are the problems similar,5
teacher:And how are the problems different,5
teacher:Hunter What do you guys think;student:Darn it,5
teacher:Does anyone want to share a thought about how they are similar,5
teacher:Or how they are different,5
teacher:How are the problems similar to how are they different,5
teacher:What do you get;student:Crosstalk,5
teacher:And how do they help us,5
teacher:And share with the class how you solved it,5
teacher:Franc come up here and solve number 4,5
teacher:Ailani whats my unknown,5
teacher:What number would that be,5
teacher:Who can tell me what my unknown is,5
teacher:What is it Alani,5
teacher:So our unknown is once again two but how is this one different from the last two we just did,5
teacher:How is this one different Alvin,5
teacher:The information that someone speaks gets processed in your brain and then your response comes out of your,5
teacher:Whats going into the robots ear,5
teacher:Aliyah whats going into the robots ear,5
teacher:Thats not going in what number is going in,5
teacher:Oh what number is going in,5
teacher:Now what number does the robot want to spit out of its mouth,5
teacher:Is the number getting bigger or is the number getting smaller,5
teacher:So going from in to out is the number getting bigger or smaller,5
teacher:Well in order to make a number get bigger what operations can we use,5
teacher:Who can tell me what my missing pieces what my unknown is,5
teacher:What if a squirrel took it,5
teacher:Whats my unknown in that situation Aldo,5
teacher:What if I said that whats my unknown,5
teacher:When you multiply 2 denominators what method is that for common denominator;student:I agree with you inauidble I like how you got your common denominator and you said you multiplied,5
teacher:What do you think about Clays answer,5
teacher:412ths or 5 12ths;student:okay so your answers 5ths,5
teacher:one time five twelfths and then for 5 and 6 we have;student:well Havent you you need to be sharing with a partner,5
teacher:Whats left,5
teacher:Can you explain for Duke,5
teacher:What would you do,5
teacher:And so explain how you got your answer,5
teacher:Tell us how it is whats the right answer;student:Id,5

teacher:How do you know I wasnt looking for a smiley face,5
teacher:Aaron what do you think,5
teacher:What did we call that in yesterdays lesson and in your homework last night,5
teacher:Whats it be called that when you had to write the equation with the Emmerson,5
teacher:So what does an unknown mean Ember;student:Yes,5
teacher:What does an unknown mean,5
teacher:So Elliot how did you know this answer was two,5
teacher:And our last missing numerator Estrella,5
teacher:Okay and what is the purpose;student:A benchmark fraction is one and half or maybe three fourths or one fourth,5
teacher:Who can remind me what a benchmark fraction is,5
teacher:How many pieces is she going to have to give out,5
teacher:How many pieces of something,5
teacher:What is my number sentence,5
teacher:What is my number sentence Melvin,5
teacher:How many pieces,5

teacher:What do we need to know from this problem,5
teacher:Give me the important information,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:What is the question we are answering;student:One half yard ball,5
teacher:What is our question,5
teacher:Who would like to come write the number sentence on the board;student:Yessityyes,5
teacher:Whats the question asking us,5
teacher:Now how many pieces is she going to have,5
teacher:Now the question is how many pieces of pita bread will she have to share,5
teacher:Turn to your equal partner and solve this problem,5
teacher:So can you come up with a number sentence and an image,5
teacher:Number three,5
teacher:Who remembers the vocabulary word,5
teacher:What did you get,5
teacher:This is also what,5
teacher:Number three Rodney,5
teacher:What number sentence do you see in that picture,5
teacher:I see how many halves are in two cups,5
teacher:Whats the question asking us,5
teacher:What do you notice about that picture,5
teacher:Whats the difference,5
teacher:What would be the difference if we did a half divided by two divided,5
teacher:How much are you getting out of that whole glass,5
teacher:How many halves are in two cups of water,5
teacher:There are,5
teacher:How many pieces of pita bread will she have to share,5
teacher:So all you need to know is what,5
teacher:What do you notice about the image,5
teacher:Miller can you tell us what are benchmark fractions,5
teacher:What could our picture be,5
teacher:Lillian will you come draw your picture,5
teacher:Think to yourself whats the value of that 4 in 43,5
teacher:What is the value of that 4 in 43,5
teacher:It is worth,5
teacher:Discuss this with your partner please how you did this step,5
teacher:Who would like to share their thinking here;student:Okay good,5
teacher:And what did you get;student:I know I got it wrong,5
teacher:Everybody what is 4 x 6,5
teacher:What is 4 x 0;student:Okay okay I see,5
teacher:What is 0  2,5
teacher:What is 5 x 4;student:Can I have that,5
teacher:What is 4 x 0,5
teacher:What is 0  2,5
teacher:What youre missing;student:How did you get 20000,5
teacher:So whats 4 x 5,5
teacher:So youve added What did you get;student:Stop,5
teacher:And then 3 x 5 is,5
teacher:Whats 0  1,5
teacher:Where have you heard of an algorithm before,5
teacher:What am I multiplying by,5
teacher:But we need to have how many;student:It doesnt have to be a yard,5
teacher:So using using Lillians picture what is our final answer;student:Yessityyes,5
teacher:Whats three times two,5
teacher:Oh whered it go,5
teacher:How many pieces do you have,5
teacher:Karla will you come show your whiteboard please for five divided by one third,5
teacher:Who would like to share theirs,5
teacher:What could our picture be,5
teacher:Stand up and youre going to elbow up with the partner and explain your picture and your answer,5
teacher:What was the answer for three divided by 18,5
teacher:Antonella can you tell me how you got that answer,5
teacher:Can you explain that;student:Im going to really explain,5
teacher:What did I say is the most common mistake that you guys make;student:Get this so what answers,5
teacher:Now Celeste would you like to share your thinking please,5
teacher:Okay Charlie how did you do it;student:Yes,5
teacher:Tell me about this,5
teacher:What was the answer for four divided by 16,5
teacher:How much does she put in vase two;student:38,5
teacher:09 because its;student:zero point nine,5
teacher:Four;student:38,5
teacher:This called,5
teacher:Yes so what would you need to do with the zeroes,5
teacher:What is the real answer,5
teacher:What should that be,5
teacher:What is this,5
teacher:What one should go first,5
teacher:How is this answer wrong,5
teacher:Where should the decimal be,5
teacher:What is this,5
teacher:Zeroes and on the number,5
teacher:What word needs to be done,5
teacher:What do you think I need,5
teacher:Whats five plus three,5
teacher:Plus zero is And what is three if I add three to it,5
teacher:Zero plus two is,5
teacher:So you would say How would you say;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Whats eight plus two,5
teacher:What numbers did you estimate here,5
teacher:So what did you estimate,5
teacher:What do I have here then,5
teacher:Did I have part of a one or a whole one,5
teacher:Blake tell me what you did,5
teacher:Can someone explain using,5
teacher:Correct terminology of mathematical of understanding of the place value how to help Mr Haley,5
teacher:How to help Haley,5
teacher:Whats that word,5
teacher:What numbers are you adding here,5
teacher:So what were the estimates used,5
teacher:Is 2 310 closer to two or three,5
teacher:So it would be two plus;student:Two,5
teacher:So 2 310 closer to two or three,5
teacher:So youre does it make it closer to seven or does it make it closer to eight,5
teacher:How;student:Eight,5
teacher:How did you get six plus seven,5
teacher:What numbers did you estimate,5
teacher:Eight nine 10 What did we do here,5
teacher:Im not sure what you did here,5
teacher:Whats nine plus six,5
teacher:How did you get that,5
teacher:Okay so what answers did you get;student:Well you can split a whole number into 5  times,5
teacher:So please explain what you did,5
teacher:What is 3 times 5,5
teacher:What is 4 and 5,5
teacher:What is 7 times 5,5
teacher:What is 2 times 5,5
teacher:I put 3 instead of 15 and turn it in;student:No but 15 times,5
teacher:3 and 1 is;student:You just said,5
teacher:And 3 and 5 is,5
teacher:And what did you get for problem number one;student:Mason,5
teacher:How did you get 3;student:For the first question we got 3,5
teacher:Explain to me how you got 3,5
teacher:What do you mean 5 into fifths;student:If you took,5
teacher:So what I got was For the  I got 4,5
teacher:And Julia what did you do for the third one,5
teacher:Notice Haleys words were I looked to the what side of the 1,5
teacher:So what was your answer,5
teacher:What did you do with 99 and 12 hundredths,5
teacher:Whats eight plus,5
teacher:And whats two plus,5
teacher:What is seven plus four,5
teacher:But also whats eight plus one,5
teacher:Im making the number longer because what am I doing with,5
teacher:Realizing four times 10 to the power of four is what is that,5
teacher:If I had to write that out as another sentence how would I write that,5
teacher:So what happens because this is 11,5
teacher:So what is a whole number James,5
teacher:What does the strategy mean,5
teacher:So in math we call those techniques what,5
teacher:Al;student:Strategies,5
teacher:What algorithm do I use to solve something,5
teacher:Eric number one explain what you did and what number you came up with,5
teacher:So that three tenths tells me does it stay 87 or does it become 88,5
teacher:What is the correct response everyone,5
teacher:So whole number has no,5
teacher:Haley go ahead explain what you did,5
teacher:Explain what you did,5
teacher:Four plus five is;student:100,5
teacher:So  what mistake did you make by keeping that four,5
teacher:Is nine times closer to one or a half;student:I already know whats going on,5
teacher:So your estimate would be one and is eight times minus it closer to one or closer to half,5
teacher:So what would it be,5
teacher:So is ninetenths closer to one or a half,5
teacher:So is eigthtenth closer to one or a half,5
teacher:So my estimate would be;student:One,5
teacher:So what is the easiest way for me to get a denominator,5
teacher:How do I get four and three into a common denominator,5
teacher:Whats the quickest way to do a common denominator,5
teacher:Nope what do I do,5
teacher:And what does four times three equal,5
teacher:So now what do I have to do Gage,5
teacher:What step do I need to take next,5
teacher:can you explain it;student:Four times three,5
teacher:So those of you that didnt raise your hand  what did you use;student:Oh no,5
teacher:Oh I forgot to ask what was the estimate you used on the first one Mark,5
teacher:How is problem one different from problem two;student:Wait what do you mean by,5
teacher:How are they different,5
teacher:Julia what did you get for the next one,5
teacher:And the last one,5
teacher:what did you get for the first one buddy,5
teacher:what did you get for the next one,5
teacher:Okay and for the final one;student:For the second one I got 927 and 51 hundredths,5
teacher:You will have to be able to show how you estimated this how you estimated and solved it and be able to discuss with a partner how the problems are similar and how they are different,5
teacher:Demonstrate to the class what you did okay,5
teacher:And what times three equals twelve,5
teacher:When you two went and met what did you do,5
teacher:I am too because Zoe what denominator do you have in your answer for number two;student:I would agree with what she just said,5
teacher:So what times two equals three;student:A third,5
teacher:Does anything times two equal three,5
teacher:So how can three be your common denominator;student:No,5
teacher:So I need to know I need an explanation of what you did,5
teacher:How are these problems different,5
teacher:Evan how are these problems different,5
teacher:What discussion did you have when you realized what she got wrong,5
teacher:How did you make this work;student:And how did you get it,5
teacher:Now what do I need to do Gage,5
teacher:What am I multiplying this one by,5
teacher:So Austin whats nine times three,5
teacher:And up here whats ten times two,5
teacher:So now what is my next step,5
teacher:Whats ten minus nine,5
teacher:How do I do it,5
teacher:Its got to be a mixed number now how do I make it a mixed number,5
teacher:Go back and figure out what you did wrong,5
teacher:So what did you multiply this five by,5
teacher:Turn it into an improper fraction;student:Julia joined us because she,5
teacher:If the denominators are not the same what do you have to do with the mixed number,5
teacher:Who can tell me what standard form is;student:Oh,5
teacher:What do you think Amy,5
teacher:Okay so what is standard notation do you think;student:Yeah,5
teacher:The standard form everybody was what,5
teacher:20 plus 80 is,5
teacher:Because what I do to the What Ill do to the,5
teacher:Alison whats the rule,5
teacher:Now what do I need to do,5
teacher:What by two,5
teacher:And what does that equal,5
teacher:What am I doing up here,5
teacher:And what does that equal,5
teacher:Austin whats nine minus four;student:I got six,5
teacher:And what is my new fraction;student:Five,5
teacher:Haley do you know how to make it into an improper fraction,5
teacher:How do I do it buddy,5
teacher:Now what do I need to do Gage,5
teacher:Haley explain again please,5
teacher:What do I need to do,5
teacher:Alison how am I going to find the common denominator,5
teacher:What am I multiplying,5
teacher:What is two times three,5
teacher:Now Haley what do I need to do now,5
teacher:So what would I multiply my two by,5
teacher:Now what else do I need to do,5
teacher:Now Austin what do I need to do,5
teacher:Okay  what did you get for the first one,5
teacher:And Rob tell me how you did the next one,5
teacher:Jake explain to me how you did the next one,5
teacher:What are these called,5
teacher:What do you think these tick marks are doing;student:Tick marks,5
teacher:What do you think those tick marks are doing,5
teacher:What are these tick marks for,5
teacher:What do you think they have them there for,5
teacher:What what do we use them for,5
teacher:So you believe its for what;student:So if you were to put them into groups you would represent the  If you if you,5
teacher:To separate them into what,5
teacher:Alison what did you and your partner talk about,5
teacher:To divide the squares into what Josh;student:What me and my partner said is to divide the squares,5
teacher:We are not locating anything so its like a coordinate grid in breaking it down to the size of the,5
teacher:How does this area relate to multiplication Will,5
teacher:How does this area model relate to multiplication;student:Um,5
teacher:What would 3 times 3,5
teacher:How does this ares model show the product of twothirds and twothirds,5
teacher:Is the product greater than or less than the factors,5
teacher:Do they have both of those thirds shaded or only one of those thirds shaded,5
teacher:Greater than or less than the factors,5
teacher:Then what do I do,5
teacher:Explain this to me,5
teacher:Which one is going to be bigger,5
teacher:So is this true or false,5
teacher:Ethan explain this to me,5
teacher:So which is smaller;student:Um this is false because one is um zero nine nine the one will prevail because theres a zero before the ninety nine,5
teacher:I would like you to tell me how to make my area model first;student:Okay,5
teacher:And what way did you do thirds;student:So first I split it into thirds,5
teacher:And how did I how did you break that one into thirds;student:And then I broke it into another third  to be,5
teacher:These four boxes here are,5
teacher:So what is my answer,5
teacher:I have four boxes double shaded,5
teacher:So what is your new understanding of this,5
teacher:What do you are you not doing,5
teacher:Now Austin tell me the easy way to do this,5
teacher:And what does that equal,5
teacher:The answer is it greater than or less than the factors,5
teacher:One third two thirds which leaves me how many thirds,5
teacher:Four what;student:Four,5
teacher:What are the dimensions of the larger square,5
teacher:Then what is the area of the shaded rectangle,5
teacher:Well first thing we need to figure out is how many are shaded 4 and how many total pieces do we have together now,5
teacher:What are these tick marks worth,5
teacher:What are these tick marks worth;student:Dont know,5
teacher:What are these tick marks worth,5
teacher:I want to know what the denominator show me with your fingers what what the denominator be,5
teacher:So I need Michael to explain what the denominator is first of all,5
teacher:So the top number or the bottom number,5
teacher:So what is the whole that theyre trying to figure out,5
teacher:What do you think theyre worth,5
teacher:Mason explain to me,5
teacher:If I have one fourth two fourths three fourths here Noah what am I going to have here,5
teacher:What am I going to have next;student:Uh one fourth,5
teacher:What am I going to have next,5
teacher:Now what are the dimensions of the shaded rectangle,5
teacher:And onethird by onethird is only,5
teacher:Because then;student:Yeah,5
teacher:So then the area would be length times width which is 1 times 1 equals everybody,5
teacher:And what does that equal Michael,5
teacher:What are the dimensions of the larger square,5
teacher:Miss Zoe what do you think of the dimensions of the larger square are,5
teacher:Large square,5
teacher:Large,5
teacher:What is the area of the larger square,5
teacher:What is the area of the larger square,5
teacher:Whats the formula for area;student:Or no,5
teacher:Tell me what you think,5
teacher:Whats 1 times 1;student:Oh,5
teacher:What are the dimensions of the shaded rectangles;student:Yes,5
teacher:What are the dimensions of the shaded um,5
teacher:What is the what are the dimensions of the shaded squares my friend youve got it written,5
teacher:What are the dimensions of the shaded squares,5
teacher:What is the area of the shaded rectangle John,5
teacher:Area of the shaded rectangle;student:Um,5
teacher:And Michael what would the multiplication sentence be,5
teacher:So what is the area of the large square,5
teacher:What do you think Eric,5
teacher:So less than means what;student:I thought it meant five tenths is larger than,5
teacher:And how many of them are shaded with those colors,5
teacher:Explain how you did the first one,5
teacher:So think so explain your steps and do it;student:I think so yeah,5
teacher:Explain your thinking doing the problem,5
teacher:So you made that;student:So,5
teacher:Repeat back what do you think that you have a better understanding about,5
teacher:Tell me your new understanding of this,5
teacher:So if you choose a method to do this what did you think is the easiest way to do it,5
teacher:Okay so explain to me what you did the first time,5
teacher:You did,5
teacher:So then the in number is,5
teacher:So 24 divided by 4 the at number will be,5
teacher:So what would it be,5
teacher:Dont make this What did you say,5
teacher:What is a number that I could do that would give me an in,5
teacher:Now how am I going to get my out number,5
teacher:So how did you do the first one;student:We thought that would be the same as we did the first one,5
teacher:I mean 1 times 15 Im sorry,5
teacher:Whats 1 times 5;student:Because you cant,5
teacher:Then you said you would do what,5
teacher:What strategy did you use because strategy is our word,5
teacher:Eric tell me about the next one,5
teacher:Ethan tell me how you did the next one,5
teacher:And Zoe tell me about the last one,5
teacher:Im going to have you go back and stand by your partner now and Im going to have you discuss the rules that you came up with for these,5
teacher:What do I do with that 3 though,5
teacher:What do I do with that 3,5
teacher:How did I get my out number up here,5
teacher:Okay what about the second one,5
teacher:So Julia explain the rule that you knew you could use,5
teacher:Okay so Julia what was the next question that I asked you,5
teacher:How would you solve this problem;student:How would you solve this problem,5
teacher:So Julia would you please tell the class how you did 15 of 35,5
teacher:Talk while youre doing it though,5
teacher:What is 3 times 2;student:It would be 2,5
teacher:So we can only go how many times;student:Uhhuh,5
teacher:How do you think you should do the second one,5
teacher:Lily go ahead and tell me how you did the next one,5
teacher:What did I do,5
teacher:How did I get that 9,5
teacher:Then what did you do,5
teacher:Tell us what it is,5
teacher:So tell me  real quick,5
teacher:So what happens when you divide 2 divided by 3;student:10 feet of ribbon  on a large,5
teacher:What do I have to do to make that work,5
teacher:Explain how you did this,5
teacher:What does that equal,5
teacher:How many times does 8 go into 20,5
teacher:Whats 10 minus 6;student:How much ribbon does she use,5
teacher:So I have 2 and 48 and what do I need to times,5
teacher:So now what is 10 plus 2 and 48,5
teacher:And what,5
teacher:My rule whats my in,5
teacher:What is my in number friends,5
teacher:And what is the answer,5
teacher:What did I come out with,5
teacher:But what;student:So we already know that theres 4 remainder 1 and then since its 13 times 23 its not 13 we have to multiply,5
teacher:Well Haley immediately came up with what,5
teacher:And then Zach what did you tell me my next step was,5
teacher:So what would I do here,5
teacher:If my in is 12,5
teacher:6 and what equals 12;student:2 is 12,5
teacher:Okay so whats going to be my first times what here,5
teacher:Times 2 and divided by,5
teacher:What is 13 divided by 3,5
teacher:So would it be 4 remainder 1 or would it be 4 and a third,5
teacher:Equals,5
teacher:So 4 and a third and then,5
teacher:Tell me,5
teacher:So my problem here is 13 is it 2,5
teacher:Tell me what answer you got,5
teacher:Okay give me your answer,5
teacher:I would like you guys to give me your strategy that you used to do this,5
teacher:So what she did is 3 times what is going to get me closest to 14 or 13,5
teacher:Haley what did you originally say we had to do,5
teacher:How did you get 8 and 23;student:So that would be 8 and,5
teacher:What are the dimensions of the shaded rectangle,5
teacher:So how do I get seventeenfifths and elevensevenths to a denominator of 35,5
teacher:What are my final coordinates,5
teacher:Okay those of you that are done what are you going to do with sailboat number two,5
teacher:Wheres the two now,5
teacher:Wheres the two,5
teacher:What is the first number,5
teacher:Show me where 16two is;student:16two,5
teacher:Wheres 16two,5
teacher:Now wheres 10two;student:Wait are we timesing it by two again,5
teacher:Eight times two is,5
teacher:One times two is;student:16,5
teacher:Five times two is;student:Two,5
teacher:One times two is;student:10,5
teacher:Five times two is;student:Two,5
teacher:Seven times two is;student:10,5
teacher:One times two is;student:14,5
teacher:Two times two is;student:Two,5
teacher:What have we got going there,5
teacher:Five times two is;student:Four,5
teacher:What is your strategy that youre using here Anna,5
teacher:Eight times two;student:Zero,5
teacher:One times two is;student:16,5
teacher:Five times two is;student:Two,5
teacher:One times two is;student:10,5
teacher:Five times two is;student:Two,5
teacher:Seven times two is;student:10,5
teacher:One times two is;student:14,5
teacher:Two times one is;student:Two,5
teacher:Five times two is,5
teacher:One times two is;student:10,5
teacher:All right everybody zero times two;student:Got it,5
teacher:One times two;student:Zero,5
teacher:Two times two;student:Two,5
teacher:Zero times two;student:Four,5
teacher:Seven times two;student:Zero,5
teacher:Zero times two;student:14,5
teacher:One times two;student:16,5
teacher:One times two is;student:10,5
teacher:Zero times zero;student:Two,5
teacher:One times two;student:Zero,5
teacher:Eight times two is,5
teacher:Where is that,5
teacher:So eight stays the same one times two is,5
teacher:One times two is,5
teacher:One times two is,5
teacher:My X is after Ive done that so where would fiveseven be do you think,5
teacher:Now show me where onetwo is,5
teacher:Okay whats your next,5
teacher:Whats your next one,5
teacher:Okay wheres fiveone at;student:Zerotwo,5
teacher:And what two are you going to connect now,5
teacher:Whats your first number here,5
teacher:Okay so show me where 16one is;student:16one,5
teacher:Okay now wheres 10one,5
teacher:I need you to give specifics on what is the difference between sailboat one two three and four,5
teacher:Eight times two is,5
teacher:Seven times two is,5
teacher:Two times two is,5
teacher:Zero times two is,5
teacher:Two times two;student:Two,5
teacher:Zero times two;student:Four,5
teacher:Seven times two;student:Zero,5
teacher:Zero times zero;student:14,5
teacher:Or zero times two sorry;student:Zero,5
teacher:Eight times two,5
teacher:One times two;student:16,5
teacher:So eight times two is,5
teacher:Now what are you going to connect with that one,5
teacher:So eight times two is,5
teacher:Five times two is,5
teacher:Five times two is,5
teacher:One times two is,5
teacher:And what do I do with this;student:Two,5
teacher:So write two and what do we do with this,5
teacher:Five times one is or five times two is,5
teacher:Wheres fourzero,5
teacher:Is it a straight line or is it this line;student:It looks like you didnt connect it,5
teacher:Okay and you said originally what did you say your benchmark was;student:Sixfourths,5
teacher:So whats ninefourths minus three fourths,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:So what do you think Zach,5
teacher:How did you get 10 because thats not right;student:I know how Im getting ten,5
teacher:Tell me what you did,5
teacher:Whatd you do that Julian that you got 10,5
teacher:What is the fewest number of,5
teacher:Give me your coordinates for both,5
teacher:So park entrance,5
teacher:And what is the coordinates of the pizzeria,5
teacher:And is the fewest number of blocks you can do to get there,5
teacher:Fewest number of blocks,5
teacher:First of all what is the coordinates to the park entrance,5
teacher:What is the least amount of blocks to get there,5
teacher:So tell me how you got nine buddy;student:Nine,5
teacher:What were the coordinates of the pizzeria,5
teacher:So tell me the route that you took him,5
teacher:So tell us what you did first,5
teacher:So explain to me Julian how you got your answer and you do not know if they are wrong and you are right yet;student:This is a stupid question I should have known this,5
teacher:Whats six plus five,5
teacher:Mr Owen would you please explain what you did,5
teacher:Least to greatest;student:What I did was that greatest was 100,5
teacher:What order did you put them in,5
teacher:Smallest to biggest,5
teacher:Least to greatest,5
teacher:And greatest,5
teacher:Do the next one,5
teacher:What were your coordinates,5
teacher:Carter please tell us what you did,5
teacher:Explain to me how you did this Julia,5
teacher:What is the fewest number of blocks Ben will have to walk to get to the grocery store,5
teacher:What is the least number of blocks you have to walk,5
teacher:Whats the least number of blocks,5
teacher:What is the fewest number of blocks Ben will have to walk;student:He goes from the school,5
teacher:How many do you think is the fewest,5
teacher:Which equals;student:I think it is six and five,5
teacher:What is the least,5
teacher:The original sailboat looking at sailboat one is what,5
teacher:So you went from,5
teacher:What is the fewest number of blocks you would walk from the library to the ice cream shop,5
teacher:Tell me another place he could be,5
teacher:Where could it be Amy,5
teacher:What if I do one two three four;student:Try,5
teacher:Luke how am I playing this game,5
teacher:Explain it,5
teacher:So then what am I doing each time,5
teacher:Changing what;student:Youre trying to get closer to the treasure,5
teacher:Is it closer to zero half one one and a half or two,5
teacher:On the first one threefifths plus onefourth what is it closest to,5
teacher:When you looked at seveneighths what did you come up with,5
teacher:Was that closer to a half or a whole,5
teacher:And then fivesixths is that closer to a half or a whole,5
teacher:Is that what your answer was or was it just a half,5
teacher:All right Eric talk to me about this next one,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Tell me one place he could be Adam,5
teacher:Where could your friend be,5
teacher:When I get to three give me the coordinates together as a class,5
teacher:So how many is it,5
teacher:Give me your coordinates,5
teacher:Library to ice cream shop,5
teacher:Library to ice cream shop,5
teacher:What is that,5
teacher:What are the coordinates I am looking for where did we start,5
teacher:So what are the coordinates of the library,5
teacher:And where did we have to go,5
teacher:How many blocks did you think it was babe,5
teacher:And what are the coordinates of the ice cream shop;student:To the ice cream shop,5
teacher:So its vitally important that you make sure and you always go what coordinate first,5
teacher:And then;student:X,5
teacher:What is the fewest number of blocks you would walk from school to the pool,5
teacher:School to the pool;student:School pool,5
teacher:Mr Julian what are my coordinates first for the school,5
teacher:And to the pool;student:Zero zero,5
teacher:How many blocks,5
teacher:You got what,5
teacher:So we always need to remember that when we are adding or subtracting fractions what do we have to have,5
teacher:How much bigger;student:Bigger,5
teacher:What does this tell you to do,5
teacher:So if I look at this I know that this is what coordinate up here,5
teacher:What one always comes first;student:Tripled the X and doubled the,5
teacher:So in my explanation what should come first;student:X,5
teacher:Because 4 x 3 is what,5
teacher:What is your width coordinate,5
teacher:What are the highest marks on the book,5
teacher:How much larger would you want that picture to be,5
teacher:Tell me what you revised,5
teacher:Zoe tell me what you wrote,5
teacher:Tell me what you added,5
teacher:Did you give final coordinates,5
teacher:Sizes,5
teacher:What does it come out to be in the end;student:But what I rewrote was The rule that Jake and can to make his picture wider and taller is he can quadruple his X and Y coordinates,5
teacher:Whats a thing,5
teacher:Tell me what changes you made on your paper,5
teacher:Which one of those is the better explanation,5
teacher:Tell me what you said originally and then what you rewrote,5
teacher:What is it missing,5
teacher:So this one says triple,5
teacher:If I write a rule what does that rule need to contain,5
teacher:If I write a rule what does that rule need to contain,5
teacher:What kind of words would I use,5
teacher:What am I going to do with those coordinates,5
teacher:But how do I write that down;student:Make them bigger,5
teacher:How was your prediction correct,5
teacher:How was your prediction incorrect,5
teacher:Read me yours,5
teacher:Tell me what yours says,5
teacher:So what do you think the new picture will look like,5
teacher:Be specific about how you think the book will change,5
teacher:What did you write Ryan what did you write,5
teacher:What did you write for number two on the front,5
teacher:If he changed it by six what should it be,5
teacher:How was your prediction correct,5
teacher:What is it missing Zoe;student:Yes,5
teacher:What is 16 15,5
teacher:How wide is the book;student:Would it be 8 or 16,5
teacher:how tall is the book,5
teacher:Where did you get that,5
teacher:And then what would they be if you tripled each of those,5
teacher:What did you write the first time,5
teacher:And what is going to be your end result;student:Quadruple both of the coordinates,5
teacher:What exactly was your end result;student:Its going to be bigger and,5
teacher:But my end result has to get me to what size,5
teacher:Whats it going to be,5
teacher:Did you give me end result numbers,5
teacher:So what do you have to add there,5
teacher:The ending result which would be;student:The coordinate,5
teacher:So what would the other side be,5
teacher:Im going to ask you to add in what were your end coordinates,5
teacher:So what was your end coordinate here,5
teacher:And;student:So 12,5
teacher:Taller and,5
teacher:So if your coordinates start at five and four so where are your five and four,5
teacher:So your rule has to be what,5
teacher:How can it be one if the original one was two and zero;student:One,5
teacher:What is its coordinate,5
teacher:But what is 16 15,5
teacher:What is 15 16,5
teacher:What are those,5
teacher:Making the book 16 inches,5
teacher:And 15 inches;student:Wide,5
teacher:What did you say for number two,5
teacher:Tell me,5
teacher:Should my answer have been a rule or should it have been using the words bigger larger,5
teacher:Go ahead through the next one,5
teacher:You could not what,5
teacher:What does double by three mean,5
teacher:What did you write today after our learning,5
teacher:So if your first grid anything times zero is what,5
teacher:So where should you book have started;student:Zero,5
teacher:Hey Zach does your book start at zero or one;student:Zach,5
teacher:Where is the bottom point of your book,5
teacher:What did you add to it;student:And then I couldnt find out what,5
teacher:My question was what do you think he needs to do;student:question,5
teacher:What is the difference between the question I asked and the answers I got,5
teacher:Haley what did you guys talk about,5
teacher:Whats between four and five;student:Okay there you go,5
teacher:Okay so whats four and a half plus four and a half;student:You need to make the line right here,5
teacher:Half if nine is;student:Nine,5
teacher:Okay what if I want to do 11,5
teacher:Whats five plus five,5
teacher:Okay so what if I did five and a half plus five and a half,5
teacher:What do I get,5
teacher:So what does that mean Im multiplying everything by,5
teacher:So what would this first one be,5
teacher:What does enlarge mean everybody,5
teacher:Okay so throughout the lesson today your diagrams whatever youre making on those grids should be getting what,5
teacher:What does the word greater than mean everybody,5
teacher:If I am minusing 50 from the answer is it going to be greater than or less than,5
teacher:If I am adding to it is it going to be greater than or less than,5
teacher:If I am multiplying it is it going to be greater than or less than;student:Greater than,5
teacher:So whats a half less than five,5
teacher:Okay whats half of 10;student:I made it go to twoone then twoone,5
teacher:Whats closest to nine thats a whole number;student:You made the go all the way to one and a half,5
teacher:Okay so what would be half of seven;student:Three plus three is six,5
teacher:And of the original pair what does it tell you to do with the second number;student:Double the first number,5
teacher:Okay what are you doing with yours;student:This would be a half not zero,5
teacher:So what is double the first number,5
teacher:And what is half of one;student:16,5
teacher:If I double zero;student:Wait so first,5
teacher:Zero and I attach a zero;student:Oh thats just still going to be zero,5
teacher:So what are you going to do,5
teacher:If I am subtracting 125 from it is my expression going to be less than or more than,5
teacher:Eight times,5
teacher:Whats half of five,5
teacher:Whats two plus two,5
teacher:If I need one more to get to five and I need to cut that in half whats half of one,5
teacher:So if I want half of that five whats in between,5
teacher:So what is halfway between zero and five,5
teacher:One two and,5
teacher:So half of seven whats closest to  Three plus three is,5
teacher:And 24 and;student:Wait so  Never mind,5
teacher:So you are doing the triple answering these questions and then down here youre going to triple the first number which would be eight times,5
teacher:If Im subtracting 798 plus 212 from 798 plus 212 what is my answer going to be;student:Less than,5
teacher:So all of these would be;student:Less than,5
teacher:Nick whats the next one,5
teacher:And then what is the very last one Austin,5
teacher:So now whats this one,5
teacher:So show me how you would take it from nine to the five;student:It will double,5
teacher:Now show me 11 seven,5
teacher:Now 12 and eight,5
teacher:What should it be,5
teacher:What would that one be;student:The difference,5
teacher:I want you to think about by looking at this what did this question ask you to do,5
teacher:Youre answering what does Jake need to do,5
teacher:I want to know what Jake needs to do,5
teacher:What is that telling you right there Jake needs to do,5
teacher:How do I need to reevaluate my work,5
teacher:Michael what did you and your partner talk about,5
teacher:What did you guys write on your paper,5
teacher:And then Haley whats the next one buddy;student:It is,5
teacher:Now Michael what are the next coordinates going to be,5
teacher:What is her first coordinate,5
teacher:What are Sarahs new coordinates,5
teacher:Whats it going to look like,5
teacher:She plans to put a trapezoid What is a trapezoid everyone,5
teacher:What does a trapezoid have,5
teacher:Mr Matt if Sarah uses her rule what do you think the new trapezoid will look like;student:Yes,5
teacher:Yep tell us what you wrote buddy;student:Can I just say what I wrote,5
teacher:So by doubling the X coordinate my trapezoid is getting,5
teacher:If I double the Y coordinate my trapezoid is getting;student:Wider,5
teacher:If Im dividing it is it going to be more than or less than,5
teacher:She is wanting to make it;student:Taller,5
teacher:If I double one I have,5
teacher:If I double five I have,5
teacher:If I double five I have;student:10,5
teacher:If I double zero I have;student:10,5
teacher:What did I not do Maddy;student:No,5
teacher:If I double one I go to;student:Four,5
teacher:So now what are Sarahs new coordinates Logan,5
teacher:So if I am doubling I start at zero because if I double zero I have what;student:That was the next one,5
teacher:What did you write down Will,5
teacher:What did you write,5
teacher:What did you write;student:Multiply by denominator,5
teacher:And then what did you guys get for your estimate on number one;student:Okay,5
teacher:And did you round to the nearest 10 or the nearest 100;student:I got 130,5
teacher:But what are you going to have to figure out,5
teacher:So it says how many more people,5
teacher:So how many people live in Riverhead town,5
teacher:It says what,5
teacher:So see if you can write out your word problem what would be your number model with the unknown,5
teacher:What are you actually going to be doing,5
teacher:So what did you actually start with with your equation,5
teacher:Emanual what did you do for your equation,5
teacher:And so were looking at in which group did each student have the greatest amount of veggie pizza,5
teacher:How do you show which one is bigger,5
teacher:How do you explain that,5
teacher:Okay so what do you guys think you might start out with;student:Its a little noisy on my side,5
teacher:Okay so for the first one how many pizzas were there;student:I started dividing them out and each of them gets one Well theres still four pieces of pizza left,5
teacher:What did you guys come up with your answer,5
teacher:And then how many people are sharing those three pizzas,5
teacher:What did you figure out;student:I a little bit figured it out,5
teacher:Can I ask how you guys did number one;student:Lets move on to number two,5
teacher:Can you share your actual equation;student:I got about 120,5
teacher:How did you do your strategy,5
teacher:What strategy did you use for estimating,5
teacher:What else could you do if you have a lot of numbers to add,5
teacher:What else could you do,5
teacher:Arthur did you get an answer;student:Arthurs not telling us what he got for his answer,5
teacher:What was your first dancer,5
teacher:Okay so what did you guys get for your actual answer on number one,5
teacher:And how will we justify it,5
teacher:What do we actually explain,5
teacher:What could we actually say,5
teacher:Anybody have an idea,5
teacher:Lucille what do you think you might say,5
teacher:So Hunter how close are your is your answer to your actual,5
teacher:How close is your answer to the estimate,5
teacher:What did you guys come up with for your answer and estimate,5
teacher:Okay so who can think of a good strategy to start off dividing these pizzas,5
teacher:You did what,5
teacher:So what would be a good strategy to divide those pizzas,5
teacher:Felix R whats two fourths plus 14,5
teacher:So instead of saying a half and a fourth you could say,5
teacher:How many pieces,5
teacher:Who can think of a way to divide out these pizzas,5
teacher:What would be the easiest way to start out,5
teacher:If theres five students what could you do with each pizza,5
teacher:And how many students are sharing how many pizzas;student:Cornfield,5
teacher:Okay and what did you guys figure out;student:And were on the one that has four pizzas and five students,5
teacher:What do you think you would do to divide up those pizzas,5
teacher:Who has an idea,5
teacher:Beau what do you think,5
teacher:And so Frankie how would you figure out how much each person gets,5
teacher:What would you do,5
teacher:And what would you do to figure out how much each student gets then once you put each one into fifths,5
teacher:And then how many how many students are sharing pizza in the meadow;student:To the meadow,5
teacher:Oh so what do you think Hunter;student:Oh,5
teacher:When you think about fourths how many fourths equal a half,5
teacher:Remember what is equivalent to a half;student:Yeah,5
teacher:What do you know,5
teacher:Okay whats the next one,5
teacher:Who has an idea for how you could start dividing those out and sharing equally,5
teacher:Hunter whats your idea,5
teacher:How much would those four students get if you did that,5
teacher:Felix R what did you get if you divided the first two pieces in half and the third pizza in four pieces;student:They would get,5
teacher:How much would each person get then,5
teacher:Felix R what did you get,5
teacher:Hey Hunter what did you get for your estimate,5
teacher:What really is that,5
teacher:Who can figure that out,5
teacher:What would we say,5
teacher:What would you say there,5
teacher:What do you think you might say instead of one half and 14,5
teacher:What really is that,5
teacher:Can anyone figure out what that is,5
teacher:A half and a fourth,5
teacher:Whats a fraction for a half and a fourth,5
teacher:Whats really important that you come up with for A,5
teacher:But I say before we get our exact answer what do we need to do on a,5
teacher:Can you explain what you did to get that answer;student:Its 776,5
teacher:Where should it have been;student:So Justin got 009 way off,5
teacher:Where should that 009 be,5
teacher:So you look at the nine tenths and the nine tenths is really how many hundreds,5
teacher:Compared to nine hundreds is how many pennies,5
teacher:So now the hardest part is thinking about how do you explain that,5
teacher:But we know what,5
teacher:what do we know about nine tenths and 900ths,5
teacher:Emelia what do we know about those,5
teacher:So think about how could you explain that in words what do you guys think,5
teacher:what would be a good way to say that,5
teacher:What can we say;student:09,5
teacher:What do you what do you mean by way off,5
teacher:Can you clarify that,5
teacher:What do you mean by way off,5
teacher:What do you mean by way off,5
teacher:And so which one is grater,5
teacher:And what fraction would this one be,5
teacher:68 what,5
teacher:5868,5
teacher:What did you guys say about that problem,5
teacher:River what do you think,5
teacher:A centimeter block weighs a little more than 95 grams which weighs more the can of soup or the centimeter block,5
teacher:And which weighs more,5
teacher:What do you notice about that,5
teacher:Who can share something they notice about that,5
teacher:MSkylerssa what do you notice about that problem,5
teacher:Instead of way off what could you say,5
teacher:And do you notice anything else,5
teacher:Tell us what do you notice about the word problem,5
teacher:Her brother Skyler used 56th of a meter to floss his teeth who used more dental floss,5
teacher:And how can you prove it,5
teacher:Okay who used more dental floss,5
teacher:Does anybody have anything else they want to say,5
teacher:What do you notice after the decimal point with this,5
teacher:Okay and what fraction would this one be;student:They have more numbers,5
teacher:What do you notice about that MSkylerssa,5
teacher:And who could think of a way to divide those for eight people,5
teacher:Instead of way off from 09,5
teacher:do you guys want to turn these into equivalent fractions to show,5
teacher:Okay and then what how can I justify that its reasonable,5
teacher:How do I know that,5
teacher:What number model can you come up with,5
teacher:And youre thinking how many will be left over,5
teacher:What do you think that means,5
teacher:What would what would be one operation you may be doing when it says leftover,5
teacher:Hunter what do you think,5
teacher:So what operation does that give you a clue you may be doing to figure out this problem,5
teacher:Lucille what did you get for your number model on one seat,5
teacher:Hunter what are you thinking,5
teacher:Equals n and N stands for what,5
teacher:Its a variable for what,5
teacher:What does n stand for,5
teacher:Lucille what is N stands for,5
teacher:How many will be left over,5
teacher:How could I restate that,5
teacher:And this part D explain how you know your answer is reasonable,5
teacher:You might want to highlight the important information and think about what is it asking us to do,5
teacher:Who can share with How about Emanual what are you going to be doing with your small group today,5
teacher:So so maybe use that word equals a fraction is a really 09 is what,5
teacher:How many hundredths,5
teacher:What did you decide;student:Yeah,5
teacher:So how do you say the first decimal,5
teacher:How do you say that,5
teacher:But if I put it out of 100 how many hundreds would it be,5
teacher:How do you say the second decimal,5
teacher:For nine tenths,5
teacher:How do you say that one,5
teacher:So when you look at 900ths and 9000ths what do you guys notice about those,5
teacher:Who can tell me what multi actually means,5
teacher:What is multi mean,5
teacher:When we talk about words Liliana what does multi mean,5
teacher:Youre not doing it all together youre going to read it together in your small group youre each going to come up with what you think the number model is,5
teacher:What is the number model,5
teacher:And then how will we estimate that together,5
teacher:So what did you do there;student:Yeah,5
teacher:So see if you can come up with another example of why why something would not work,5
teacher:What do you think we might do,5
teacher:What would be another strategy,5
teacher:What do we know about two thirds,5
teacher:Do I have a friend who wants to share but Id like you to share your thought process,5
teacher:What did you do at first and then how did you revise your thinking,5
teacher:Can you read your explanation Ray,5
teacher:Grant can you come up and share,5
teacher:How did you get your answer then,5
teacher:Did anybody do both on the same problem share what wouldnt work and what would work,5
teacher:Rory would you come up and share what you got for number two,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:Well if you basically put the two eighths plus two eighths together how much is that,5
teacher:Its actually four eighths and four eighths is really what;student:Four sixteenths,5
teacher:If you put a half plus a half you get,5
teacher:Heres his equation at the bottom but instead of two sixteenths plus two sixteenths plus four sixteenths what are you going to change that to,5
teacher:Marie can you come up and share what you had,5
teacher:Ray do you want to share something else,5
teacher:Okay so Marie what did you do,5
teacher:What is four out of 16,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:What is one fourth plus one fourth,5
teacher:How could you prove its a no,5
teacher:How could you guys prove its a no,5
teacher:You can actually use your picture though and if you use that same picture Marie you could actually use your picture and write that equation out and show what,5
teacher:How did you guys find that out on number one,5
teacher:Whats a half plus a third plus a third,5
teacher:What did you do Daxton,5
teacher:Marie whatd you do,5
teacher:Whats a sixth plus a sixth,5
teacher:Which is one third and whats one third plus two thirds,5
teacher:How does that work Harold,5
teacher:It wouldnt work to have one third plus one third because you would have how much,5
teacher:What do they turn into,5
teacher:Martha what did you do,5
teacher:What does it equal Martha when you add a fourth plus an eighth plus an eighth,5
teacher:Two eighths equals what,5
teacher:Do you want to try,5
teacher:Whats equivalent to four sixteenths;student:Four out of 16 is,5
teacher:What do we do,5
teacher:What happens when you have variables on both sides,5
teacher:So all were learning here is what does this mean,5
teacher:What does this little f of two mean,5
teacher:And whats the X that goes with it,5
teacher:So how do you answer that from a picture,5
teacher:Tell me what the Y that goes with it is,5
teacher:So what do I do,5
teacher:What does range mean,5
teacher:Which one of these two things is the range of this graph,5
teacher:Remember ranges ys which one of these two pieces of notation shows you where the y values exist for this graph,5
teacher:Drag the smiley face to the correct one,5
teacher:Jim has 400 and spends 10 every day which of those is the correct rule in slope intercept form that matches,5
teacher:Drag the star,5
teacher:Remember how does it start,5
teacher:And how does it change,5
teacher:Is it changing in the positive direction or changing in the negative direction,5
teacher:which one has something happening in it,5
teacher:Anyway which one of these tables is not a function,5
teacher:How do you see that in a table which of these tables is not a function,5
teacher:Which one of these graphs is not a function which one fails the vertical line test,5
teacher:No whats 30 divided by three;student:Isnt it 10,5
teacher:What happens if its all variables,5
teacher:And I say to solve for n,5
teacher:So where are things that are smaller than three,5
teacher:Which one is correct,5
teacher:How many shaded areas are there,5
teacher:How many Xs show up in that answer,5
teacher:A half becomes what,5
teacher:Whats the slope,5
teacher:So we just look at there and say What is the number thats right next to the x,5
teacher:Whats the coefficient of the x,5
teacher:Whats the slope,5
teacher:Whats the y intercept,5
teacher:Well what did we say on both of those previous slides,5
teacher:So we look at that we say what is the y value going up by,5
teacher:And so what do we do,5
teacher:Whats the y intercept,5
teacher:Whats half of a half,5
teacher:How did you figure out fourths,5
teacher:If you have one third and two thirds and then you have a half what do you know about that,5
teacher:Which ones bigger,5
teacher:Which one appears to be bigger to you Zack,5
teacher:So which one appears to be bigger,5
teacher:Okay so number one I want to know first of all which group did you find out had the greatest amount of pizza,5
teacher:What did you guys figure out,5
teacher:What did you guys figure out,5
teacher:What did you come up with for the first question,5
teacher:And so they were sharing how many pizzas;student:The four students that went to the forest preserve,5
teacher:But then if you look at three fourths if I colored three fourths which one has the most shaded in,5
teacher:Which one has the most shaded in boys and girls,5
teacher:Lets seven eighths is greater than what,5
teacher:What would be the next biggest,5
teacher:Which one is closer to a whole,5
teacher:The closest to a whole,5
teacher:Kenneth what are you thinkingOut of those four fractions which one would be the next biggest,5
teacher:What are you thinking,5
teacher:Which one do you think is bigger,5
teacher:Do you think its four fifths or seven eighths,5
teacher:four fifths or seven eighths,5
teacher:Can anyone think of another strategy,5
teacher:How much do each student get,5
teacher:How many pieces,5
teacher:They almost what,5
teacher:What is seven eighths almost,5
teacher:Gordon what is seven eighths almost,5
teacher:Yeah because the whole would be how many pieces;student:Its almost one,5
teacher:And then which ones bigger,5
teacher:Im going to put those in fifths and how much would they get,5
teacher:Lacy what did you get,5
teacher:So if we look at number one it says in which group did each student have the greatest amount of veggie pizza,5
teacher:Okay what do you guys think,5
teacher:What do you think the biggest fraction is between three fourths three fifths four fifths and seven eighths,5
teacher:Gordon what are you thinking,5
teacher:What do you think about that one,5
teacher:Which one do you think is bigger,5
teacher:What did you guys get for that one,5
teacher:Well whats your idea,5
teacher:Three fourths or three fifths,5
teacher:Liam what did you say before about seven eighths,5
teacher:But then we figured out what;student:I thought that four I thought that four fifths would is bigger would be bigger because they would have bigger slices then seven eighths,5
teacher:What did we actually figure out,5
teacher:I would like someone to come up and share their sketch,5
teacher:Can you come up and put your journal under here and share what you did,5
teacher:Show us what you did,5
teacher:Explain your equation here on the bottom,5
teacher:She has her addition equation and Marylin what would be the multiplication equation,5
teacher:How much of the land is the queen planning on giving her daughters in each problem,5
teacher:Queen Arlene wants to do what,5
teacher:How could you actually divide this land,5
teacher:How do you think you could draw a picture of that,5
teacher:What do you know about two thirds,5
teacher:What was your thinking originally,5
teacher:Is it more than the whole or is it less than the whole or is it the whole four thirds,5
teacher:What is the whole when you talk about thirds,5
teacher:How do we know seven eighths is bigger than four fifths;student:For which one,5
teacher:Frankie do you want to share your explanation,5
teacher:Who has a really good idea,5
teacher:What do you guys think,5
teacher:What did you get for question one,5
teacher:How did you get that,5
teacher:And seven eighths is closest to what,5
teacher:Whats that;student:I realized something,5
teacher:Do you think 12 13ths or five sixths is bigger,5
teacher:Which one do you think is bigger Emmett,5
teacher:What do you guys think,5
teacher:Which one do you think is bigger Three fourths or three fifths,5
teacher:Which ones bigger,5
teacher:12 13ths or five sixths,5
teacher:Which one do you think is bigger,5
teacher:How do you know that,5
teacher:Okay so we are trying to figure out out of all of these pictures which one was the biggest,5
teacher:Who wants to share what they got for number one,5
teacher:Can anyone share what they wrote for number two or share something that you must include in your answer,5
teacher:How would you explain that diagram though to justify your answer,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:What would it be;student:No,5
teacher:Cooper do you have another example,5
teacher:Who can give another example like that of how it wont work,5
teacher:How much of the casserole did group B take,5
teacher:and then how do you explain that;student:I guess wed just explain that,5
teacher:What does the word mean,5
teacher:Okay so how did you use the picture to solve the problem;student:explain how you use the picture to solve the problem,5
teacher:How did you use that picture,5
teacher:So how did you come up with;student:number two,5
teacher:If they took 1212 how much of the casserole would they have taken,5
teacher:What is the picture telling me Michael;student:and then we add the,5
teacher:Okay how much does it  that group A took,5
teacher:No no how much did group A take,5
teacher:Eight what,5
teacher:How much is left over,5
teacher:What I need to know is that they took how much,5
teacher:And then group B took,5
teacher:PEMDAS its Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally so parentheses;student:Oh PEMDAS,5
teacher:Get up go discuss your problem with your partner,5
teacher:So how did we do that;student:That  or that,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:What does it mean to interpret,5
teacher:So what did I say to the class when I allowed them to use that demonstration;student:Okay so then after youve solved these we have to pick two of them and do it on this paper,5
teacher:So what did Abi say was the easiest strategy,5
teacher:Perfect and then what was my response on what I wanted you to do for number one;student:We have to solve all of these ones up here,5
teacher:Can you tell me what you wrote for number one,5
teacher:What did you write,5
teacher:Can I ask what you are writing,5
teacher:If when you get ready to do  and you only have to model one here and one here how are you going to solve the other one,5
teacher:How are you going to solve three four five and six,5
teacher:How are you going to solve them,5
teacher:But if Ive only asked you to model two doing area model how could you do the rest,5
teacher:And what one did you choose down here,5
teacher:So if I do three fourths how many twelfths does it take to make this,5
teacher:What would I have to use,5
teacher:What tool would I have to use,5
teacher:What does it mean to interpret,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:If Im doing a whole number of a fraction am I going to come out with a fraction or a whole number;student:Or yeah yeah,5
teacher:Fernando opened a box of pizza inside there was three fourths of a pizza Fernando ate half of what was remaining how much of a pizza did Fernando eat,5
teacher:What did he start with,5
teacher:Emily questioned how would you use the first one in buying something;student:Thats what I said,5
teacher:Volume and comparing amount of measurements so if a child is three feet tall and her father is two times taller her fathers what,5
teacher:Okay Ben and James please read yours,5
teacher:What is it miSing,5
teacher:It had the proper what is the vword,5
teacher:And it had the proper mathematical,5
teacher:How much feet of carpet do we need;student:So we are getting a carpet and we need eight feet for our length and seven feet for our width and then we have to multiply eight by seven so how much feet of carpet do we need,5
teacher:Is it how much feet of carpet do I need or how many feet of carpet do I need,5
teacher:Seven boxes of eight tiles how many tiles does he have all together everybody;student:has seven boxes of eight tiles how many tiles does he have,5
teacher:Dani earned 9 in allowance last week he spent two thirds of his allowance on comic books how much money did he spend on comic books,5
teacher:What is two thirds of nine;student:Two thirds,5
teacher:Well you have the number model so what operation did you use;student:So what mathematical,5
teacher:Thats what its asking is greater than leS than or equal too,5
teacher:All right go ahead Isaac or Ben and come and show me what you did,5
teacher:Come and show us what you did;student:I wrote it a little bit different I did,5
teacher:What did you guys say,5
teacher:Okay please share out what your group talked about,5
teacher:So you said Im sorry did you say greater than leS than or equal too,5
teacher:All right and now Im going to do Abby is not here James the last one is three fourths times one half great than leS than or equal too,5
teacher:And what did he eat;student:Three fourths,5
teacher:What does real world context mean James,5
teacher:Would you figure out how much paint youd need to cover a room;student:Yeah,5
teacher:What is real world for you,5
teacher:Greater than leS than equal to,5
teacher:Three fourths times three greater than or leS than three fourths;student:Greater than,5
teacher:Three fourths times one greater than leS than equal to three fourths,5
teacher:Tell me what weve learned in the last couple of days,5
teacher:Three fourths times a half greater than leS than equal to,5
teacher:What happens when you multiply a number by one,5
teacher:What happens when you multiply a number by one;student:What,5
teacher:Would it be the same or would it be greater than or leS than;student:Oh,5
teacher:Three fourths times three is it greater than leS than or equal too three fourths,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Okay Gage can you explain the next one,5
teacher:Anything we multiply by one,5
teacher:Okay and what about this one,5
teacher:Explain to me a method that you learned Mason,5
teacher:So how are you going to describe in your own words a method,5
teacher:Explain that to me,5
teacher:And what does it equal everybody,5
teacher:How did you label your tick marks Noah,5
teacher:Then what,5
teacher:Okay then what did you do down here,5
teacher:So what are the dimensions of the rectangles uh of the shaded rectangles Austin,5
teacher:What are the dimensions of the shaded rectangles,5
teacher:Michael what did you do,5
teacher:What is the area of the shaded rectangle Will,5
teacher:Will how many are shaded;student:Um the area of the shaded rectangle  would be,5
teacher:And how many total do I have,5
teacher:Charlotte what is the multiplication sentence you wrote,5
teacher:What coordinate do you always do first,5
teacher:What one do you do last,5
teacher:What have we been working on for the last three days,5
teacher:And what way to do that,5
teacher:Will whatd you write,5
teacher:How did you get four Michael,5
teacher:So I am asking a question howd you get four,5
teacher:Whatd you get,5
teacher:What did you write Charlotte,5
teacher:What did you write;student:I wrote 1 by 1,5
teacher:Okay what did you write,5
teacher:What is this bottom one,5
teacher:What is this one,5
teacher:Going up I have how many fourths,5
teacher:So first of all how do I find area Austin,5
teacher:And whats an area model Austin,5
teacher:Nope what is the model for area;student:Um,5
teacher:What do you think the area of the shaded rectangle is,5
teacher:Okay whatd you get,5
teacher:You got what;student:One fourth,5
teacher:What did you get,5
teacher:What did you get,5
teacher:What did you get,5
teacher:What did you get,5
teacher:So what is the area of the shaded rectangle,5
teacher:Adam tell me what you learned from watching this up here,5
teacher:What area models have we used to solve a half of a fourth;student:I dont know,5
teacher:We folded it into what;student:We folded it,5
teacher:Discuss what youre going to do first,5
teacher:First of all what problem are we solving;student:Hello,5
teacher:Is that plus or times;student:So were solving that that that that that,5
teacher:So what way are you going to split it into fourths what way would you like to split it into fourths,5
teacher:How many total boxes do we have there Austin,5
teacher:And how many of them are colored in both ways,5
teacher:What do you know,5
teacher:What coordinate did you put first,5
teacher:I would like Mr Connor to come up here and model what he and Miss Alyssa talked about and did,5
teacher:So your first fraction is always what coordinate;student:They did the y coordinate first,5
teacher:Okay so go ahead explain what you guys did,5
teacher:Was my problem two thirds times three fourths or was my problem three fourths times two thirds,5
teacher:Where are you going to end up,5
teacher:Whats the first thing youre supposed to do on that page,5
teacher:No first thing youre supposed to do on that page,5
teacher:So you rounded the eight to a nine because of the six but what did you forget;student:I rounded,5
teacher:What did you actually do,5
teacher:So what would this be Dan,5
teacher:Because its to the,5
teacher:What other way did we do it James,5
teacher:What was the other area model way we did it,5
teacher:Okay what happened over here,5
teacher:Can you explain what happened,5
teacher:If I round to the nearest whole number what is six going to be,5
teacher:Round to the nearest tenth whats my number going to be,5
teacher:And if I round to the nearest hundredth,5
teacher:And what have we done with that paper,5
teacher:So what numbers in the tenth position,5
teacher:Okay but what number are you looking at,5
teacher:What place value number are you going to use,5
teacher:So if that number is what are you rounding it to,5
teacher:What number is in the hundredth places,5
teacher:And what number are you going to look at to determine,5
teacher:What one;student:You go back to look if the one is above five,5
teacher:What one;student:If its higher or more raise the score,5
teacher:So what do you look at to see if that stays or changes,5
teacher:What did you get out of what they just said,5
teacher:Okay explain how you matched that;student:Good,5
teacher:So whats six divided by three;student:Here it is,5
teacher:How many inches are in a foot;student:Divide it by twenty,5
teacher:So if its 138 is the average the data point our orangutan is what,5
teacher:How many people did I measure,5
teacher:So now if I do 1245 and how many did I say we had,5
teacher:How many times does 21 go into 124,5
teacher:And then it got into 235 how many times,5
teacher:So our average height is what;student:No it would be 10,5
teacher:How many times does 21 go into 195,5
teacher:Our orangutan was how tall,5
teacher:Is he smaller or bigger,5
teacher:How do I equal out the sets Whats the data point on this,5
teacher:Nine five and three,5
teacher:What did I get Ethan when I added them together,5
teacher:17 divided by what,5
teacher:Whats 17 divided by three;student:Three,5
teacher:Now what do I have to do with that 138 friends,5
teacher:1200 and what;student:He says 1245 divided by nine,5
teacher:Zach is just about done so Im going to ask him what his answer is,5
teacher:So its 56 times what;student:I have that somewhere but I dont,5
teacher:Whats five minus three;student:No,5
teacher:Okay tell me mathematically what I did;student:I disagree,5
teacher:Austin tell me what I need to do,5
teacher:How could I do that without taking away;student:Because youre taking a layer from the one with five turning it,5
teacher:Without taking away,5
teacher:I moved it but now I want to know how to do it without taking it away,5
teacher:Whats five plus three;student:Because I dont know that what it looks like you do,5
teacher:17 divided by three,5
teacher:And whats eight divided by two;student:Eight,5
teacher:John tell me what you and your partner did,5
teacher:Where did you get four and two,5
teacher:How did that come up to four and two;student:We got it from 57 and 59,5
teacher:You did the four 59s  and what,5
teacher:All of what together Zach;student:So I think hes adding all of them together arent you,5
teacher:So what is this number that you would add right here;student:No Im adding each because you already told me what each  sticky note is worth by adding,5
teacher:What is the number you would add here,5
teacher:Tell me what you just a minute tell me what you did,5
teacher:Tell me mathematically what I did,5
teacher:Five what;student:Its five,5
teacher:So this one everybody what is it,5
teacher:What do you guys think,5
teacher:So what did  you  do James;student:and that would be 80 98,5
teacher:Will her strategy work with repeated with any pair of decimals,5
teacher:If not can you give an example when her strategy wont work,5
teacher:Can you show some ways where it wont work,5
teacher:And explain why this is not true,5
teacher:Meaning Can you make up a problem similar to this and see if it will work,5
teacher:If you cant can you give an example and her strategy wont work,5
teacher:So I want to know how did you figure it out,5
teacher:What did you notice about this,5
teacher:What are they actually comparing here,5
teacher:So what do they actually do;student:inauidble zero,5
teacher:So yeah its not really 95 and three but really what should it be Lionel,5
teacher:what did you say at first,5
teacher:Who can give an example of another another example of how it wont work,5
teacher:What do you guys think,5
teacher:What do you guys think,5
teacher:What have you guys think,5
teacher:Connor explain your thinking,5
teacher:In what;student:Emperors penguin heights,5
teacher:What is this one;student:Inches,5
teacher:What is the height of the smallest red kangaroo represented on the plot line everybody,5
teacher:How many are there,5
teacher:Now how many total inches of height are represented by these exes,5
teacher:Do that tell me right now,5
teacher:How many total inches are represented there;student:Just exes,5
teacher:Tell me what you believe each one  of these represents,5
teacher:How many total inches,5
teacher:Alison tell me what you did wrong;student:And then 180 plus  why did you just  because youre adding all,5
teacher:And what you didnt understand,5
teacher:What were you thinking,5
teacher:What did I multiple,5
teacher:Times what,5
teacher:So if you multiply 60 times three what would you have gotten,5
teacher:Would they be taller or shorter than a fifth grader,5
teacher:Those of you with 181 and half I would like you to walk over to someone sitting and tell them what you did,5
teacher:If I am at to go back how many jumps  am I away from 61,5
teacher:Mathematically number sentence what did I just do;student:Something with data points,5
teacher:Jaden explain to me what you and your partner talked about,5
teacher:Okay so if Im doing is it three divided by 10  to the power of what,5
teacher:What should it be;student:No,5
teacher:Where is the decimal;student:It should just be two because,5
teacher:What do I need to do,5
teacher:It should have been three divided by 10 to the power of,5
teacher:What expression is greater than,5
teacher:I want you to tell me what expression of those is going to be the largest,5
teacher:And you are not using the counter so basically all youre doing is by playing against the computer youre going to do what,5
teacher:What way am I moving my decimal,5
teacher:What  is my number,5
teacher:And  I started here so what,5
teacher:Im moving it to,5
teacher:Now Im going five and six tenths times 10 to the power of what,5
teacher:When we multiply  Gage what happens to our number,5
teacher:So if a number is 66,5
teacher:Where does the decimal go when you get ready to solve these,5
teacher:What would it have been;student:No,5
teacher:What do you mean at the beginning;student:At the beginning,5
teacher:All  right so should you put the decimal point when Im talking about three divided by 10 to the power of four where does my decimal point start,5
teacher:And whats two times two;student:Two,5
teacher:Three times 10 is,5
teacher:And four times four is,5
teacher:So we had three fourths of 16 so we divide 16 by four which is,5
teacher:And then four times three is;student:Four,5
teacher:And when we are dividing we move the decimal to the;student:Right,5
teacher:And what happens when we move to decimal to  the right;student:Left,5
teacher:How many,5
teacher:And when we move it to the left,5
teacher:One point what,5
teacher:What sign are you going to put there,5
teacher:And if I need it less than I move the decimal one point to the;student:Right,5
teacher:So what is this new number,5
teacher:What way are we moving it,5
teacher:So what is my new number,5
teacher:Matt go ahead and show us what you did and explain and please stay standing,5
teacher:Whats the easiest one to write Russel,5
teacher:Mathematically what did I just do,5
teacher:How many points did you get,5
teacher:What is the range,5
teacher:Dan explain your thinking please,5
teacher:So were you basing this off those of you that said hes shorter were you basing it off the 48 or the 58,5
teacher:So  in order to figure this out what do we have to be able to do,5
teacher:But what else do we need to do,5
teacher:So what was our vocabulary word,5
teacher:So how do we get to that data point,5
teacher:How  do you think we get to that data point,5
teacher:How do you think we get to that data point,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:But what am I going to do with that,5
teacher:Im looking at the data but I dont know what Im going to do with it,5
teacher:How do I get to the majority do you think;student:I would most the majority part like how many people had that one,5
teacher:What could we do to even out the heights of the tower,5
teacher:What could we do,5
teacher:What  could we do to even out the heights of the towers,5
teacher:Is he taller or shorter,5
teacher:May I see what you wrote please;student:Mmhmm,5
teacher:May I see what you wrote please,5
teacher:Taller or shorter,5
teacher:Tell me how you did that,5
teacher:How many threes sets of three can I make out of five;student:I knew that fivethirds is  because five is,5
teacher:And how many do you have left over,5
teacher:What shouldnt change,5
teacher:So what is your answer;student:The denominator,5
teacher:Can you talk us through teaching her,5
teacher:So tell me how you figured this out,5
teacher:So it would be what is the average,5
teacher:What did you write,5
teacher:Is the orangutan  taller or shorter than a fifth grader,5
teacher:How many inches is four foot five;student:Because there are still some people that are taller than   There is one that is still four foot five,5
teacher:Whats 12 times four,5
teacher:Plus five,5
teacher:Is he taller or shorter than a fifth grader,5
teacher:Is he taller or shorter,5
teacher:Is he taller or shorter,5
teacher:Is the orangutan taller or shorter than a fifth grader,5
teacher:In vase three;student:38,5
teacher:Then whats directly in the middle,5
teacher:Which is for what number,5
teacher:And what is 2,5
teacher:What is 2 plus 8,5
teacher:What did I do wrong,5
teacher:Okay I can use traditional US multiplication to multiply two digit numbers by two digit numbers and use estimation what is estimation everybody,5
teacher:To evaluate what does it mean to evaluate something,5
teacher:What do you think Amy,5
teacher:How does it look,5
teacher:So the process is what am I doing first,5
teacher:Im multiplying my what,5
teacher:So everybody whats seven times six,5
teacher:Everyone what is seven times thirty,5
teacher:Twenty one and twenty one plus four;student:No two hundred and ten,5
teacher:And its because of the carry over and how do I count up,5
teacher:Everyone what is twenty times six,5
teacher:What is two times three,5
teacher:What is 4 plus 0,5
teacher:Okay what is twenty times thirty;student:Six,5
teacher:So what is 0 plus 0,5
teacher:Whats 4 times 60,5
teacher:Explain what you did on the one that I asked you to explain,5
teacher:Explain that to me,5
teacher:But how do I know thats not 206;student:Because the bigger is always on the top and because I know,5
teacher:The value of what is 20;student:because the value is 20,5
teacher:And whats the value of the 6;student:The value of the two is 20,5
teacher:What place value does this number sit in;student:Its 6,5
teacher:The 2 what place value does it sit in up there,5
teacher:What place value does this sit in here,5
teacher:How is my area model going to look different,5
teacher:How is my area model going to look different,5
teacher:4 times 0 is,5
teacher:4 times 60 is,5
teacher:And 800 plus 240,5
teacher:So it would be 800 plus 240 plus 0,5
teacher:Whats 4 times 0 everybody,5
teacher:And whats 4 times 200,5
teacher:Because if Im adding one to it what do most people do,5
teacher:I say what is two times six,5
teacher:Or two times three;student:Twelve,5
teacher:You always add those zeros because you make sure you are in line with the process you are doing;student:There you go,5
teacher:Fifty,5
teacher:No;student:Oh did I have anything that I needed to carry,5
teacher:Five hundred,5
teacher:Whats two plus zero;student:All right,5
teacher:Seven,5
teacher:Nine;student:Whats five plus four,5
teacher:I had no idea;student:I didnt know that that was going to be the same answer,5
teacher:Were evaluating,5
teacher:So write your five carry your three;student:Um thirty five,5
teacher:Then whats three times five,5
teacher:Eighteen,5
teacher:What is thirty seven times twenty;student:Okay now add those two together,5
teacher:Whats thirty seven times five,5
teacher:Thirty five,5
teacher:Four,5
teacher:And if it was the thousands place,5
teacher:And then when I started teaching math I was like what is ten times four,5
teacher:And four hundred or forty plus three is what;student:Four hundred,5
teacher:And plus one;student:Six,5
teacher:Everybody whats seven plus two,5
teacher:Or Im sorry two plus zero,5
teacher:Five plus two;student:Two,5
teacher:Seven plus two;student:Seven,5
teacher:What is my three really worth,5
teacher:What is my six worth,5
teacher:And would you discuss that,5
teacher:But as I said in the process if I do twenty times thirty I get sixty and if I had to add one,5
teacher:Think about the information theyve given you,5
teacher:Elijah what do you think,5
teacher:Layla what do you think,5
teacher:What do you think Annie,5
teacher:Everyone whats eight times four,5
teacher:Everyone whats eight times five,5
teacher:And okaywhat is eight times fifty;student:Forty,5
teacher:Now how could you use that information to help you solve fifty four by eighteen,5
teacher:Would you discuss that,5
teacher:What is the value of that 2,5
teacher:What is the value of that 2,5
teacher:4 times 700,5
teacher:How many  do you need,5
teacher:What is 9 times 10 to the power of 2 everybody,5
teacher:Whats 7 times 10 to the power of 2,5
teacher:So if I know that 9 times 7 is what,5
teacher:What am I multiplying it by,5
teacher:10 to the power of what,5
teacher:What is my answer,5
teacher:Do you know what process this is called;student:And then I did 9 times 4 and got 36 and then I added them together and got 306,5
teacher:Do you know if I asked you the algorithm that you used here do you know what this is called,5
teacher:Partial,5
teacher:Show me what you did,5
teacher:No I want you to explain exactly what you did to get this answer;student:Then I accidentally did 9 time,5
teacher:Tell me what you did,5
teacher:Tell me how you got 216;student:I did,5
teacher:4 times 7 times 10 to the power of 2,5
teacher:7 times 10 to the power of 2 everybody,5
teacher:So here we go 4 times 7 everybody,5
teacher:So what is 4 times 7 times 10 to the power of 2,5
teacher:So we all know that 7 times 6 is,5
teacher:Whats 7 times 6,5
teacher:And if I add it to the power of one,5
teacher:So whats my answer down here;student:No,5
teacher:Whats 7 times 4,5
teacher:whats 7 times 4,5
teacher:So 7 times 10 to the power of 2 is what Canon,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:How can it be 280 when all is Im doing is 7 times 10 to the power of 2,5
teacher:I have the power of 2 what have we been working on the last two days,5
teacher:So whats 7 times 10 to the power of 2,5
teacher:How many zeros am I attaching to seven;student:I dont know,5
teacher:What is my answer,5
teacher:So what do I have here,5
teacher:7 times 10 to the power of 2 is what,5
teacher:Now whats 4 times 7,5
teacher:Im attaching how many zeros to 7,5
teacher:Carry your three,5
teacher:But so 9 times 2 is,5
teacher:And then if I add 3 to it what do I get;student:9 times 20 is 180,5
teacher:How did you do the bottom one,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:Explain to me how,5
teacher:So 56 in the ones place is worth what,5
teacher:Whats the value of the number in the ones column,5
teacher:Whats the value of the 5,5
teacher:So 7 times 6 equals,5
teacher:7 times 50 equals,5
teacher:And I know Im doing what with my zero;student:Yes,5
teacher:And what is 350 plus 42,5
teacher:So what are your numbers up here,5
teacher:So what should be the only two numbers up here,5
teacher:What should this number be though,5
teacher:What should this number really be,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:What would you have to do,5
teacher:Now how would you come up with that answer;student:7 times 6 42,5
teacher:Sorry now whats this times this,5
teacher:What would your answer be down here,5
teacher:The more we own the mistakes we made the more we are going to,5
teacher:So everyone what is 34 times 9,5
teacher:What strategies did you use that were normal strategies to you,5
teacher:What was the first thing you did when you looked at that problem,5
teacher:And then what was different,5
teacher:So I want you to think about if the problem was 4 times 9 how would you have done that everybody,5
teacher:What is the answer;student:4 times 9,5
teacher:9 times 20 is,5
teacher:Now what is the same about doing 34 times 9 and what is different than doing 4 times 9,5
teacher:Think about what steps you would have started with what you did that was the same and what was different,5
teacher:Amy talk to me what was the same what did you do,5
teacher:What was the same thing that you would always do if you were multiplying something and what was different,5
teacher:Whats another thing that you did that was the same or different,5
teacher:Explain that to me;student:I kind of did it just like he did,5
teacher:How do you make that whole number though,5
teacher:What would you do there,5
teacher:Whats the same whats different,5
teacher:And 10000;student:Three zeros,5
teacher:Eighteen,5
teacher:Yes but yeah they have to match,5
teacher:009  okay so now what am I gonna do with the four the Four Maddy;student:I think,5
teacher:Um okay so now what am I going to do Maddy,5
teacher:Whats the next spot,5
teacher:Oh all right Duncan go tell me what Im doing now,5
teacher:What does that equal,5
teacher:Am I multiplying Or am I adding,5
teacher:sWhat is the next thing I am going to do;student:Yeah,5
teacher:So Zach what is that going to come out to be,5
teacher:What is one 100ths times 700ths,5
teacher:Reese what is the first thing I have to do Reese before I start adding these What do I have to make sure Ive done,5
teacher:What am ai doing over here;student:Yeah I know but adding,5
teacher:Im doing;student:Adding,5
teacher:but what is the First thing I need to make absolutely sure Id done before I start adding these,5
teacher:decimals or lining up Adam what else do I need to make sure lines up;student:the decimals are lining up,5
teacher:Who feels comfortable sharing their answer,5
teacher:Okay where am I going to put the nine Maddy;student:Which equals 49,5
teacher:Duncan can you share your answer with us,5
teacher:So now I would like Maddy to explain how Im going to multiply this,5
teacher:The order I put the numbers in or lining the decimals and place values up,5
teacher:They each day got three of how many,5
teacher:Three what Everybody,5
teacher:How many days Is she going to be gone Adam;student:cuz you put three cans and theirs five in each,5
teacher:Well Adam if you had 5 10 15 pieces and you divided it by three what do you get;student:So I dont um I thought it was 15th because I thought we Were doing addition but is this like division or something,5
teacher:But five days and how many parts of each can did she get,5
teacher:What does three tenths times seven tense equal,5
teacher:Explain holding your whiteboard up like that in front of the camera;student:Okay,5
teacher:Explain what you did,5
teacher:I dont care if its right or wrong Julia I just want your explanation,5
teacher:then go ahead and show me what youve done,5
teacher:Okay so is the purpose right now understanding the area model or adding the decimals together;student:I just dont understand area model inaudible,5
teacher:Okay so when you added the decimals together what did you get;student:Adding the decimals together,5
teacher:Okay what is the difference;student:Yeah,5
teacher:What did I do that you did not do,5
teacher:but does it matter inaudible what is most important;student:I think I started with the biggest number first and then I did  the smallest,5
teacher:What is seven times four,5
teacher:Whats nine plus four;student:Um so 28 and then 49,5
teacher:Okay so what is seven plus zero;student:Yeah thats what I did,5
teacher:whats nine plus four;student:plus zero is seven,5
teacher:is 1112ths closer to a half or a hole is 612ths closer to a half or a whole,5
teacher:And what do you think would be a reasonable answer for this,5
teacher:Okay Maya will you please explain your estimate and then how you solved it;student:Yes,5
teacher:How much brown paint does he have left,5
teacher:How do you think were gonna figure this out,5
teacher:Okay so what o that gives us What;student:Um maybe we could do 18 20ths minus 920ths first,5
teacher:Okay so um I have a question if we minus 920ths minus 182ths what about that one;student:920ths,5
teacher:Hows that going to help us with our the answer,5
teacher:change the nine to a ten;student:I mean a 10,5
teacher:and have 19 twentieths,5
teacher:Talk to me about what you guys discussed,5
teacher:Could you please talk to me about what you guys talked about,5
teacher:Okay so tell me what you guys did with estimation;student:Yes so I was a little stuck but I think I may have got the right answer,5
teacher:How are we going to solve this problem First,5
teacher:what is the first thing we have to do with one and nine twentieths,5
teacher:So automatically Brogen I know am I adding subtracting multiplying or dividing this question,5
teacher:How much paint does he have left,5
teacher:They want us to know to ask how much paint he has in all,5
teacher:Okay so now if Im subtracting eight ninths minus four ninths what is my answer going to be Michael,5
teacher:Okay whats four plus one;student:Um that would be 13 So then carry the one,5
teacher:And I want you to explain help me explain to that class What makes an equivalent fraction,5
teacher:What makes an equivalent fraction,5
teacher:What what is an equivalent fraction;student:So Im explaining what a fraction is,5
teacher:So now if I am looking for equivalent fractions for a half What am I going to do with my denominator Every single time,5
teacher:What did you do with the denominator the eight,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:Day 4 is going to get 123 day five is going to get 123 So what is my answer,5
teacher:Tell me what you guys get talked about,5
teacher:What would I consider number sense here,5
teacher:What did you have to know Zach,5
teacher:And I said Now how did you know that an easier way thinking about number sense about something that you learned when you first started adding numbers together way back in kindergarten first or second grade,5
teacher:our denominators the same how are we going to add that,5
teacher:So carter two fifths plus two fifthsWhat answer is that;student:Yeah,5
teacher:How come four fifhts are two fifths plus two fifths didnt become four tenths,5
teacher:Excellent because my denominators are the;student:because you only add the numerator,5
teacher:What were your answer;student:We talked about how we,5
teacher:What do I need to divide these cans into,5
teacher:What am I dividing those cans into,5
teacher:so what do I need to divide these cans into;student:Five,5
teacher:One thousand two hundred,5
teacher:You see how Im estimating;student:There you go,5
teacher:Okay thank you,5
teacher:Explain what you did there and how you did it,5
teacher:Great but how did you section that graph paper off,5
teacher:Can you explain how you;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Help me,5
teacher:So I know that seven times three equals what Landon,5
teacher:What am I missing Landon,5
teacher:What am I missing in my answer 21,5
teacher:So Landon do you know a way I can move the decimal or figure out how to bring the decimal to where I need it,5
teacher:Explain it please;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Tell me what you did to solve this problem go,5
teacher:Okay what did you get,5
teacher:How did you write that 16,5
teacher:Whats three times four;student:Okay,5
teacher:Forty,5
teacher:Whats eight times six,5
teacher:Okay,5
teacher:You did something wrong here,5
teacher:What am I going to carry over,5
teacher:Right okay,5
teacher:Fifteen,5
teacher:Now I am moving over to my tens value right,5
teacher:Nate what is two or twenty times seven,5
teacher:Im going to carry my what,5
teacher:So Kate explain to me what you did,5
teacher:nan,5
teacher:Nate whats five plus zero,5
teacher:Twelve,5
teacher:What do I have to carry up there;student:Twelve,5
teacher:I think your elbow is touching it,5
teacher:Then she had thirty seven times five is what,5
teacher:Im going to show you something else real quickly,5
teacher:Five or more what do we do,5
teacher:And six hundred plus one hundred is,5
teacher:Okay;student:Hey thats not right,5
teacher:So what type of multiplication did you use here Kate,5
teacher:Tell me what Im going to do;student:Yes,5
teacher:ameesha gets 13 plus 13 equals How much,5
teacher:So Ethan how did you solve this,5
teacher:Okay so explain what you did please,5
teacher:What does that come up with,5
teacher:So Adam How many people are we splitting this pizza between,5
teacher:What about Mary,5
teacher:Okay so Adam What kind of a picture Could I draw here;student:Yup,5
teacher:Adam how much pizza did each person get,5
teacher:That gives me one 13 plus 13 plus 13 equals what Adam,5
teacher:How did that go for you,5
teacher:How many days Is she gonna be gone Audrey,5
teacher:What do I need to turn those cans into,5
teacher:What How am I cutting them into fractions,5
teacher:Im asking how many pieces are going to be an each can,5
teacher:How many days is she gonna be gone Reese,5
teacher:So how many pieces are each girl going to get,5
teacher:Please draw your answer on the next slide,5
teacher:Show me your fingers,5
teacher:put it in that give me your fingers,5
teacher:How am I going to write this as a whole number,5
teacher:So how am I going to solve 928 divided by 1000;student:Im your youre gonna wait what do you mean by write as a whole number,5
teacher:Okay but how would I really read that;student:And then it would be 09 28,5
teacher:How would I read that,5
teacher:Is my answer right or wrong Landon,5
teacher:And notice that they just keep going up 14243 fourths dot dot dot all the way up to 16 fourths okay because 16 divided by four everybody is,5
teacher:How can I do this using division,5
teacher:US traditional and what are we supposed to master by the end of the year;student:US traditional,5
teacher:Okay Matt can you explain to the class what you did and what order of operations you used,5
teacher:because you had to divide those rabbits into,5
teacher:Where did you come up with 8 buddy;student:Yes,5
teacher:If I say I cut that pizza into 8 eighths and I have two friends and I want to know how many each of us is going to get how many pieces would each of us get,5
teacher:Tell me what how you solved this;student:Yes,5
teacher:John can you explain what you did,5
teacher:How can you cut it into thirds John;student:Well when inauidble I cut the pizza into thirds,5
teacher:Each person gets how many pieces of pie everybody,5
teacher:What did your expression look like,5
teacher:Whats the very first thing I have to do with one and nine twentieths;student:one and 920ths,5
teacher:And 1000;student:Two zeros,5
teacher:Base 10 whenever I am multiplying something by 10 what am I attaching,5
teacher:What else do you know,5
teacher:What did we do yesterday,5
teacher:What was our whole lesson based around,5
teacher:David what was it based around,5
teacher:Nathan what do you remember from yesterday,5
teacher:What were we making with our arrays,5
teacher:Penelope what were we making with our arrays,5
teacher:Does anybody remember what a square number is,5
teacher:Or can you just tell me whats a square number Owen,5
teacher:Ella do you remember what is square number;student:Mmhmm,5
teacher:A little longer,5
teacher:I gave you a word yesterday and I said these two numbers are called Do you remember what that is,5
teacher:Yeah part of it because we know its three times three equals what,5
teacher:If I needed to figure out how many squares were in here on a five by five array what would I say,5
teacher:How would I figure out five times five,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:We came up with a bunch of strategies yesterday,5
teacher:Carrie what do you know,5
teacher:What do you already know about lines line segments and rays,5
teacher:If I turned 41 this year what year was I born,5
teacher:What year was I born,5
teacher:What information do I need,5
teacher:What does that have to do with anything,5
teacher:So what year are we in,5
teacher:What is y,5
teacher:The opposite of addition is,5
teacher:If I was born in 1940 how old would I be,5
teacher:Whats one minus one,5
teacher:Two minus four;student:Zero,5
teacher:If I take for my two it has to go to my;student:No,5
teacher:hundreds place and my zero turns into;student:Zero,5
teacher:And now I can take from here to turn this into;student:A 10,5
teacher:Whats 12 minus four,5
teacher:What can you tell me,5
teacher:What do you know,5
teacher:Count by fives,5
teacher:What did you do to solve it,5
teacher:David what was one of your strategies,5
teacher:When I move to the left it gets,5
teacher:Nick wheres your next answer,5
teacher:So where was your first answer,5
teacher:My five is worth,5
teacher:My five is worth,5
teacher:Okay her next number is,5
teacher:What is that five worth,5
teacher:When we move to the right we went up by,5
teacher:When I go to the left it becomes what;student:Its always the same thing,5
teacher:What am I doing,5
teacher:We dont add because what happens when I add zero plus zero,5
teacher:What happens if I have 10 plus zero,5
teacher:What happens if I have 10 and attach a zero to it,5
teacher:Think about that that anything times zero is,5
teacher:10 to the power of one is just,5
teacher:What happens everybody when my number moves to the right,5
teacher:How many square feet of fabric will Ms Bathery need,5
teacher:Carrie whats my area,5
teacher:Somebody tell me whats the area,5
teacher:Ella what was your strategy,5
teacher:So you were counting by what number;student:My strategy was that I counted five times seven,5
teacher:Whats five times seven;student:Five 10 15 20 20 25 30 35,5
teacher:Kevin what was your strategy for this one,5
teacher:Owen what was your strategy,5
teacher:Mila what did you do;student:Beautiful,5
teacher:What answer did you get;student:No,5
teacher:If I turned 41 year how old am I,5
teacher:Four by six;student:What is she doing,5
teacher:Julia what did you do,5
teacher:Any other strategies happen,5
teacher:Ella what did you do,5
teacher:Six groups of four is,5
teacher:Now it says well whats the area,5
teacher:If this is a five by eight rectangle how many squares are in there,5
teacher:Whats the area,5
teacher:What are our strategies,5
teacher:If I turned 41 this year what year was I born,5
teacher:What year is it;student:Well the last three are way far in the future so you cant be born in the future if youre here right now,5
teacher:No I wantWhat do you notice about the numbers up there;student:I figured out that,5
teacher:Carrie whatd you do,5
teacher:Diego  whatd you do;student:I did two eighths plus two eighths plus two eighths,5
teacher:Alan whatd you do;student:I did threeeighths plus threeeighths,5
teacher:Are we talking about water or glue,5
teacher:What do you think we need to figure out first;student:No,5
teacher:Carrie what do you think,5
teacher:How much water are we going to need,5
teacher:How do we figure out how much water they need for  all the;student:Yes,5
teacher:Avery what do you think,5
teacher:How did you get ninefourths cups of water;student:Thats going to be ninefourths cups of water,5
teacher:Diego what do we get,5
teacher:What does that give me,5
teacher:Eightfourths plus  Oh;student:Eightfourths,5
teacher:So  what is it;student:Ninefourths,5
teacher:We have a whole here and a whole here plus,5
teacher:How many of these did you have;student:So I did oneeight plus oneeighth plus oneeighth plus oneeighth  all the way to eight ones,5
teacher:Chloe will you decompose this for me,5
teacher:whatd you do,5
teacher:So  give me an example for fourfifths,5
teacher:Five;student:38,5
teacher:So whats the equation;student:Yes,5
teacher:How do we figure out how much food coloring she used,5
teacher:Because we know that multiplication is what;student:I got it right on the first equation,5
teacher:What do we get;student:Repeated addition,5
teacher:How many teaspoons of almond oil did she use,5
teacher:Does anybody remember how much almond oil she used,5
teacher:One quart,5
teacher:How many batch is she  making,5
teacher:How would that turn into addition,5
teacher:Look at my picture what did I take;student:I think it would be 23  5,5
teacher:If I wanted to write this as a multiplication problem how would I write this,5
teacher:So how many teaspoons did she used,5
teacher:How many teaspoons of cinnamon flavoring  are needed for five batches,5
teacher:What does it mean to decompose fractions,5
teacher:What does it mean to decompose a fraction,5
teacher:Okay so if I were to use this in Word what do I have;student:Yes,5
teacher:10 to the power of two is,5
teacher:equals;student:Equals,5
teacher:Baking;student:It was the answer,5
teacher:How much whole wheat flour do we need for one recipe,5
teacher:For one recipe,5
teacher:So what are we going to do to that,5
teacher:Okay and then whats my answer Diego;student:Either add it three  times or multiply it,5
teacher:But what is that;student:Yes,5
teacher:Between what two whole numbers does your answer to problem 1C lie,5
teacher:Where is one and a half going to be;student:All the way to,5
teacher:Where would it be,5
teacher:How many batches is that,5
teacher:How many  times am I going to multiply this recipe,5
teacher:What year was I born,5
teacher:What are your thoughts when you see some of those answers;student:Is that even a year,5
teacher:What are you thinking,5
teacher:What do we think when we see those answers,5
teacher:What else do you notice,5
teacher:So then how much do we need,5
teacher:So whats the answer,5
teacher:David how many teaspoons do they need for all three recipes,5
teacher:So what are we going to do to this onefourth teaspoon,5
teacher:What are we making,5
teacher:The sisters want to do what,5
teacher:If  youre tripling something how many are you making,5
teacher:What is it;student:Three,5
teacher:That means Im going to,5
teacher:How many teaspoons of baking powder do they need,5
teacher:How much is one recipe for baking powder,5
teacher:They have enough water because in order for everyone to get water they would need a total of two and onefourths cup and one quart equals,5
teacher:So if they need two teaspoons but were making three recipes what are we going to do;student:Six teaspoons,5
teacher:Which means were going to;student:Were going to triple the portion,5
teacher:By;student:Multiply,5
teacher:Which would mean we now need;student:Three,5
teacher:What do you think it is;student:Is that six or six,5
teacher:How many teaspoons of salt do they need now,5
teacher:David in one recipe how much salt do they need  for one recipe,5
teacher:Onefourth what;student:Onefourth,5
teacher:I said What are we going to do,5
teacher:And if Im multiplying something by 100 what am I attaching;student:Zero,5
teacher:10 to the power of three is,5
teacher:Times 10 equals,5
teacher:What came first,5
teacher:What came first,5
teacher:What came first,5
teacher:What came first,5
teacher:What came first,5
teacher:This or that,5
teacher:What are you multiplying it by,5
teacher:Whats 10 to the power of three,5
teacher:So what should be the first number here,5
teacher:And what should be the second number,5
teacher:Whats 10 to the power of four everybody,5
teacher:And what does three times 10000 equal,5
teacher:What number comes here first,5
teacher:So whats 10 to the power of three everybody,5
teacher:And what is 25 times 1000,5
teacher:What came first,5
teacher:Whats my power of here,5
teacher:What are you multiplying here,5
teacher:Whered you come up with that four,5
teacher:100000s are;student:Five,5
teacher:1000000s are;student:Six,5
teacher:So notice that if I write this is a number sentence using the base of three times 10 to the power of two what am I adding to that three everybody,5
teacher:Or what am I attaching to that three everybody,5
teacher:How many;student:Zero,5
teacher:Because whats my exponent telling me to attach,5
teacher:So if I know that three times 10 to the power of two is really just three times 100 I know my answer is what;student:Two,5
teacher:What do I know about 10 to the power of nine,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:So if I do seven times what number am I doing it here;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Times,5
teacher:So how do I write 1000000000 everybody,5
teacher:How did I know how many zeros I needed to attach everybody,5
teacher:Everyone what is seven times 1000000000,5
teacher:How are you going to write that,5
teacher:Whered you come up with that four,5
teacher:What am I multiplying here everybody,5
teacher:What did we say expanded form was,5
teacher:What could this be;student:Oh,5
teacher:Whats five times 40,5
teacher:Whats 50 times 40,5
teacher:Whats 50 times 400,5
teacher:You have 30 seconds to tell your partner how you were able to do the problems in your head,5
teacher:Tell me where you made your mistake,5
teacher:Whats my answer going to be,5
teacher:Everybody whats this one,5
teacher:Charles whats your reasonable estimate on the first one,5
teacher:What makes your estimate of 27 270000 reasonable,5
teacher:You answer,5
teacher:How do I know that,5
teacher:And if you notice it drops by one every time 9 18 27 36 45 53 62,5
teacher:54 63 72 81,5
teacher:Which is,5
teacher:If you dont know your multiplication facts how easy is that going to be,5
teacher:Whats the basic fact of five times four,5
teacher:How can the second one be this,5
teacher:And how can I make an estimate before I solve what its asking me to know,5
teacher:What is it asking you to do,5
teacher:If I have 6125,5
teacher:What could I do,5
teacher:Who can tell me what I could do,5
teacher:Whats another way I could write it Jake,5
teacher:6000 plus;student:Just 6000 plus,5
teacher:Whats another way I could write it Harmony,5
teacher:Six times 10 to the power of three plus one times 10 to the power of what,5
teacher:10000s are;student:Four,5
teacher:Plus two times 10 to the power of,5
teacher:So this one is how can you make an estimate to help you solve a problem,5
teacher:If I estimate that a 100 times a 100 is a 1000 we know thats the answer but how do I make sure that Im looking at it for reasonableness,5
teacher:So if I said four times 10 to the power of three and asked you a reasonable answer what would you say,5
teacher:Som what would be a reasonable answer;student:Yes three,5
teacher:So thinking about the words reasonable and what is reasonable,5
teacher:Where have you heard that word before,5
teacher:What are we doing in reading,5
teacher:Plus five times 10 to the power of;student:One,5
teacher:1000s are;student:Three,5
teacher:100s are;student:Two,5
teacher:10s are;student:One,5
teacher:120 turning it into,5
teacher:Which makes my number,5
teacher:How much bigger;student:Higher,5
teacher:Because anything multiplied by zero by itself is,5
teacher:So one times zero is zero one times zero is zero one times zero is zero that would be there and then one times one is,5
teacher:When really one two three four five six I know that it is 10 to the power of six because how many zeros did I have;student:Yeah,5
teacher:So now my loves every additional zero ups my number by,5
teacher:Every attached zero ups my number by,5
teacher:Okay so this simple pattern what does it tell you youre doing,5
teacher:What does this simple pattern right here tell you what youre doing,5
teacher:How does that pattern help you understand the base 10 in the easiest form,5
teacher:How does it help you,5
teacher:And knowing the pattern that were using how does it help you write the number,5
teacher:How does it help you write the number,5
teacher:How does it help you,5
teacher:Attaching a zero to what;student:Attaching a zero,5
teacher:120 by 10 times 10 what am I doing,5
teacher:Im not adding a zero Im,5
teacher:What do I automatically do,5
teacher:What is it called,5
teacher:What is it called,5
teacher:Wheres your writing,5
teacher:Everybody should have 10 to the power of six equals what does it equal and then what does that equal,5
teacher:What would that look like;student:Okay,5
teacher:And what would that equal;student:10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10,5
teacher:What does 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 equal,5
teacher:How would I be able to know thinking about place value how many zeros to attach to a billion,5
teacher:What would that look like as a number,5
teacher:Attaching what,5
teacher:Brogan whatd you get for an answer,5
teacher:Is it easier for me to write it out in standard form or in exponential notation,5
teacher:Each time our base goes up each time our exponent goes up by one what do I do everybody,5
teacher:If I am talking about four as my base and three as my exponent what is it telling me to do with that exponent,5
teacher:If I have four to the power of three what am I doing with that four,5
teacher:What do I do to the eight,5
teacher:Thinking about attaching what,5
teacher:Because its 10 times 10 equals,5
teacher:And if I cant come up with it using the place value how in my head could I come up with it,5
teacher:He know becomes my what,5
teacher:If Im going 10 times bigger Im moving what way,5
teacher:But if I want a 10th what way am I moving,5
teacher:If I want it a 10th the size of 10 to the power of six what would it be,5
teacher:Then what would my next exponent be;student:Smaller,5
teacher:What would that one be,5
teacher:What would this one be,5
teacher:What number is that,5
teacher:What is one 10th of 1000000000 everybody,5
teacher:What would the exponential notation of this be everybody,5
teacher:Whats the standard notation now,5
teacher:What number is that everybody,5
teacher:Now 10 to the power of without thinking or without writing I want you to think of something Joshua do you remember 10 to the power of what equaled 1000000000,5
teacher:10 to the power of what is going to equal 10000000,5
teacher:10 to the power of what is going to equal 10000000,5
teacher:Ones are,5
teacher:What would this be only,5
teacher:What would that be only,5
teacher:What would this be only,5
teacher:What would this be,5
teacher:How many zeros have I attached,5
teacher:What place value is Ava,5
teacher:How many zeros do I have,5
teacher:What is he place value,5
teacher:How many zeros have I attached,5
teacher:What place value is Olivia,5
teacher:How many zeros have I attached,5
teacher:How many zeros do I have if I say 100 everybody,5
teacher:What place value is Rylan,5
teacher:What place value is Izzie,5
teacher:How many zeros have I attached,5
teacher:What place value are you Cole,5
teacher:Have many zeros have we attached,5
teacher:If I wanted to go up to 100000000000 Christian I want to know how to go to 100000000000 how many zeros do I attach;student:Yes,5
teacher:How many did I attach with 1000000000;student:Oh,5
teacher:How many place values is that,5
teacher:How many zeros have I attached,5
teacher:what kind of fraction is one and nine twentieths;student:Um first you have to so you have to look at the numbers and then if,5
teacher:Do you remember what thats called,5
teacher:What do we have to turn it into in order to subtract it,5
teacher:What do I need extra to cover,5
teacher:So whats the common denominator,5
teacher:So what if How do I turn in that common denominator to a twelfth,5
teacher:So what would my new fraction be,5
teacher:And in order to do that six times what equals twelve,5
teacher:Six times two equals,5
teacher:Now four times what equals twelve,5
teacher:And then four plus three is,5
teacher:Can you explain that,5
teacher:Which was;student:So we had to see what other piece have we had to fill it up,5
teacher:So what then did you have to figure out right then;student:One twelfth,5
teacher:What did you have to get before you could go any further,5
teacher:What more did I need to fill in this space,5
teacher:What is my problem again,5
teacher:One fourth plus two sixths;student:Two fourths plus,5
teacher:So what more do I have left to cover,5
teacher:Zach come and show them what we did;student:Yes,5
teacher:And then if I add 412 and three twelfths what do I get,5
teacher:Whats the common denominator,5
teacher:So what is my answer everyone,5
teacher:How many pieces of eighths does it take to cover a half,5
teacher:So estimate what do you think,5
teacher:If I dont have a fifth piece how am I gonna figure it out,5
teacher:How am I gonna figure it out,5
teacher:So what does fill it up,5
teacher:If the fourth doesnt fill it up what fills it up,5
teacher:What can I add to the fourth to fill it,5
teacher:What fills it up,5
teacher:What fills it up,5
teacher:What is that,5
teacher:Whats my common denominator,5
teacher:Whats my common denominator,5
teacher:For a third and a fourth,5
teacher:For two thirds and 14,5
teacher:So that means what is my common denominator,5
teacher:How many more did I need to fill it in,5
teacher:What did I have to break it down to,5
teacher:Okay how do I turn those fractions into 12ths,5
teacher:And how many tenths do I need to make a half,5
teacher:Whats the common denominator,5
teacher:So what are different ways I can solve this problem,5
teacher:Tools your fraction pieces your number line how do we solve it,5
teacher:What tools do we use,5
teacher:It will be what is if I add these together what is it going to be closest to,5
teacher:Is it going to be closest to one and a half or two,5
teacher:Is it going to be closest to a half one one and a half or two,5
teacher:What is it going to be closest to,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:What is five eighths closest to though first of all;student:And then a whole is,5
teacher:Austin would you explain the second one,5
teacher:What did you think,5
teacher:Im sorry what did you say it was closest to,5
teacher:Explain to me how you got to half,5
teacher:So how many tens do I need to fill up a fifth,5
teacher:So whats my common denominator,5
teacher:What happens when you lay that there,5
teacher:How many is it gonna take;student:Makes no sense,5
teacher:So do you see how theyre getting around it,5
teacher:Four times what equals twelve,5
teacher:And then one times three equals,5
teacher:Okay and then six times what equals twelve;student:Three,5
teacher:Yeah because what is this then;student:I did this but we only have one fourth so can I add just one fourth,5
teacher:What do I need to fix my one fourth,5
teacher:So what is my common denominator,5
teacher:How many 15 pieces does it take to make a tenth,5
teacher:So if you laid that down there how many twelfths is it gonna take,5
teacher:How many twelfth pieces does it take to make a fourth,5
teacher:Now how many thirds,5
teacher:So now I have 312 plus 412 which is what,5
teacher:So what piece did I have to use,5
teacher:How did I use an eighth,5
teacher:Are you sure this is an eighth,5
teacher:What piece do I need to fill that up,5
teacher:Is it gonna take three or is it gonna take four;student:Three,5
teacher:What do you mean it goes into it twice;student:Because 15 goes into 110 goes into one fifth twice so then,5
teacher:And what did you say,5
teacher:How many does it take the fill up that green one,5
teacher:If the monkey has two whole bananas,5
teacher:And five halves how many bananas does Mojo have,5
teacher:So how many bananas does he have,5
teacher:If the four of them each run the same distance how many miles will each person run,5
teacher:How many times;student:Yes,5
teacher:How many fourths did they get,5
teacher:How many miles are they running,5
teacher:and how many people are running,5
teacher:So how many do I need to split these three miles into,5
teacher:How many total people do you have,5
teacher:so how many miles are they running,5
teacher:Okay so theres my three miles What do I need to break that into,5
teacher:How many miles are they each going to run,5
teacher:If  You understand how a fraction can be composed being greater than one thats looking at an improper fraction and knowing how many wholes are in that numerator five or three or one,5
teacher:So youre going to use all your fractions circles and you will have something and then what other fraction circle can fit on that exactly,5
teacher:How can I come up with zero halves,5
teacher:Explain how you know,5
teacher:How many Am I going to add to eight to get to nine,5
teacher:And to get to nine I had to do How many,5
teacher:Okay so what is another name for that;student:And then plau three thirds and then a plus two thirds,5
teacher:So whats another way I can write this to where its seven fifths,5
teacher:Yeah how many wholes do I need to make it seven fifths,5
teacher:What would it be;student:Um one,5
teacher:What can I do to make this equal two,5
teacher:So what would this whole now be;student:Yeah,5
teacher:So you have inauidble how many wholes did it take them to get to seven;student:inauidble,5
teacher:I can do it with anything that is a what type of number,5
teacher:How many times did they have to add that in,5
teacher:Im breaking them into fourths what is wrong with me;student:because if they turned it,5
teacher:So if I do five fifths plus five fifths plus five fifths how many do I have,5
teacher:Okay so now how many do I have left,5
teacher:Okay so now this one how many wholes do I have,5
teacher:Okay so this would be;student:Four,5
teacher:How many twos Can I get out of nine,5
teacher:How many do I have left,5
teacher:Okay so if I have four here and I take away one what do I have;student:inauidble,5
teacher:What would a half of an 18th be,5
teacher:What type of number,5
teacher:Now what does my denominator have to be in order to add fractions,5
teacher:Does it have to fit pretty good or exact;student:I think it equals 25ths because I put 25ths on top and it fit pretty good,5
teacher:So how could you use your fractions circles to find the sum,5
teacher:How could you use the fraction circles to find the sum,5
teacher:What do you think Alyssa,5
teacher:If I take my two eighths what does it equal,5
teacher:So it didnt have anything to do with,5
teacher:What do I need to fill it in,5
teacher:What is it equal to,5
teacher:Its how do I find a common denominator using my fraction circles,5
teacher:So it takes how many eighths to equal a fourth,5
teacher:So whats my common denominator;student:Two,5
teacher:Explain to me what youre thinking;student:Okay so what I think is that if I take a half and put one fourth that wouldnt correctly really fit there so if I put,5
teacher:So explain what you and Zach talked about,5
teacher:Okay so Hunter what do we start out with,5
teacher:And then what did you set down,5
teacher:Okay go ahead explain what you did here,5
teacher:Nobody sit down Blake could you please come up here and do an explanation to your understanding,5
teacher:How could you use the fraction circle pieces to find your sum,5
teacher:So yellow and whats in an eight;student:Yellow,5
teacher:34ths bigger or a half bigger,5
teacher:So is three fourths bigger or one half,5
teacher:How do you know that;student:34ths,5
teacher:So what did you say though;student:Okay,5
teacher:Hunter explain the next one,5
teacher:38ths or 12;student:Okay um,5
teacher:And Rylan do the last one please,5
teacher:What does it have to be,5
teacher:So what is one four plus two fourths,5
teacher:Harmony tell me the first one a four plus two fourths equals,5
teacher:And what did you put to make it bigger than that;student:34ths,5
teacher:A half another plus;student:Like what size,5
teacher:Another what;student:Another,5
teacher:Is 28ths plus 18th  less than or greater than;student:Oh okay,5
teacher:A third plus a third,5
teacher:Well Alyssa what color are they,5
teacher:So what do I have to do add to my half to make it bigger than three fourths;student:34ths,5
teacher:Or;student:Thats a whole,5
teacher:Okay what would a half of a 110 be,5
teacher:How close is it to a half,5
teacher:How do I say that;student:Uh 2 uh,5
teacher:So explain to me youre thinking up here,5
teacher:Alright because thats to what;student:So what I did was I shaded these two columns,5
teacher:it is closer to what;student:I put three tenths because eight is closer to um wait,5
teacher:What is it closer to,5
teacher:One or 10,5
teacher:Zero or 10,5
teacher:Alright so understanding by filling it out am I closer to zero or to ten,5
teacher:Am I closer to three or am I closer to two,5
teacher:Is it gonna take me less steps to get from 100 to 200,5
teacher:Or am I going to be closer to 100,5
teacher:Am I right in the middle that I have to use the five or more,5
teacher:Am I closer to my 200 point here,5
teacher:Or am I closer to my 100 Point here,5
teacher:So if I were to label this I know that I have to put how many tallies in between two and three,5
teacher:So you were told to shade the grid to show what,5
teacher:How many,5
teacher:What could you have added to this to get to that,5
teacher:So how can we have done it,5
teacher:How many of these what I tell her for 407 34,5
teacher:So I go to the first position in my Okay so if I go right on the place value trap what am I doing,5
teacher:If I go left Im getting,5
teacher:Is it closer to what is the closest in the 10s place,5
teacher:Is it closer to 100 or 200,5
teacher:Alright Im sorry what are you thinking;student:You cant do that,5
teacher:Wheres the decimal,5
teacher:Everybody should have circled by what,5
teacher:Where should your X have been,5
teacher:How much taller was  than his twin sister,5
teacher:How are we gonna subtract it,5
teacher:Remember what do you have to do friends  what is the first thing I have to do before I can subtract anything,5
teacher:What do my  denominators have to be,5
teacher:four times or four times what,5
teacher:Four times what equals eight,5
teacher:How could you have added,5
teacher:Walk me through this,5
teacher:619 what;student:If theres 619,5
teacher:Okay between which 2 hundredths;student:Okay,5
teacher:So whats my number going to be,5
teacher:What is my new number going to be,5
teacher:What this one;student:Okay so those its be more,5
teacher:Whats that whats that going to be,5
teacher:going to be,5
teacher:wheres your hundreds spot,5
teacher:Tell me what number were going to look at,5
teacher:So whats that one going to be called;student:Yes,5
teacher:So whats my new number;student:Tens,5
teacher:what is my new number;student:200,5
teacher:read it to me,5
teacher:So if I know my number has to get to three and 62 hundreds,5
teacher:what is what number does this have to be to be halfway through;student:Okay,5
teacher:What number is that nine need to be halfway through between one and 2,5
teacher:Whats directly in the middle,5
teacher:What do I have to look at;student:No one because its not,5
teacher:So what is your new number if you round it to the nearest hundred Whats your number going to be,5
teacher:What number is directly in between this,5
teacher:Okay so now what number is exactly halfway between the numbers you wrote in five A,5
teacher:So what number is in my hundredths,5
teacher:So what would it be between;student:One,5
teacher:Zero to or 100 and 200;student:Zero and 2,5
teacher:So that in what hundreds,5
teacher:If I raise it to the nearest 100th whats it going to go up to,5
teacher:So what would the 100 be between,5
teacher:Because its between one and;student:Um cause Yeah,5
teacher:read it out loud for me,5
teacher:Okay between which 200 is so what is my number in the hundreds position,5
teacher:Okay so if I do that whats my number going to be between;student:Two,5
teacher:And;student:2,5
teacher:200 300 400 500 600 to give me my 600 How many would I color in for that,5
teacher:How many Am I going to color in for that,5
teacher:Am I gonna color nine of these or nine little ones,5
teacher:Okay so how many would I color in for that;student:nine little ones,5
teacher:If it tells me to raise this number to the nearest hundred what is my new number going to be,5
teacher:If I raise it whats it going to go to;student:One,5
teacher:And an explanation of how youknow,5
teacher:Which is greater this one or this one,5
teacher:How would I say that;student:zero point,5
teacher:how many sand7wiches did I have,5
teacher:Okay what am I dividing those into,5
teacher:Okay so now each friend is going to get how much of each sandwhich;student:windows,5
teacher:14th What is it equal,5
teacher:How many;student:one and a 14th,5
teacher:Okay so how do you know that though;student:Im confused because,5
teacher:Tell me what you did,5
teacher:in your own word tell me what you did;student:Okay so,5
teacher:Which was what;student:And then I split them up into equal amount of fractions,5
teacher:circles half  13 I knew two times six equals three which told me I had how many eggs,5
teacher:five sixth and see what do you do;student:One half and one third,5
teacher:the sectionswhat is the sum of the sections she initiated,5
teacher:How many thirds so what do I have to do here first,5
teacher:First thing you have to do,5
teacher:So what do I know,5
teacher:So four friends shared five sandwiches after their hike if they each ate an equal share how many sandwiches did each friend eat,5
teacher:Tell us what you did,5
teacher:How does that represent one and a half and one and a half,5
teacher:Where did you get that,5
teacher:How close is it to one,5
teacher:What do you think buddy,5
teacher:And explain how;student:One   I thought that was closest to 2,5
teacher:And Haley explain the last one,5
teacher:And what strategies do you use to keep going when a problem is challenging,5
teacher:What questions do you ask yourself when you begin solving a problem,5
teacher:What strategies do you use to keep going when a problem is challenging,5
teacher:Is three the common denominator or is six the common denominator,5
teacher:What questions do you ask yourself in the begin solving a problem,5
teacher:Yeah what questions do you ask yourself when you begin solving the problem;student:this problem what strategy should I use to do it what was the best way to get,5
teacher:What strategies do you use when you find a problem challenging,5
teacher:What kind of diagrams excellent and what is something that you said;student:What kind of diagrams,5
teacher:And then what is something you said,5
teacher:Okay and what was something you said;student:She said Ethan said to like organize or like organize the problems,5
teacher:How much fruit punch will she have,5
teacher:How much fruit punch will she have,5
teacher:what strategies do you use to keep going when a problem is challenging,5
teacher:What would you like it to be,5
teacher:And this one how do I get it to that,5
teacher:And then what do I have to do up here,5
teacher:How many hundreds;student:Hundredths,5
teacher:Rogan what is the value of the digit as a digit,5
teacher:How would I write it,5
teacher:Tell me how you wrote it right here,5
teacher:Read this read this right here How did you write it,5
teacher:Read the number,5
teacher:Ms Ava read the number for me,5
teacher:And do we say 8  point 900 or we do we say 8 and 900;student:8 point 9 hundredths,5
teacher:Haley  What is the value in words,5
teacher:How would I write it;student:The value in words in 9 hundredths,5
teacher:The value,5
teacher:Okay Haley how do you think you should write it,5
teacher:Austin read the first number,5
teacher:Which is greater,5
teacher:How would you say that,5
teacher:Amy in words what is the value of the three,5
teacher:So one two three four would be How many are doubleshaded,5
teacher:And Connor in value how would you write the nine,5
teacher:In word what is the place value of the Nine,5
teacher:And now what can I do;student:Yeah two,5
teacher:is;student:Two,5
teacher:How many of are you dividing each of these sandwiches into,5
teacher:So if I do a fourth plus a fourth plus a fourth plus a fourth what does that equal,5
teacher:But whats 54ths,5
teacher:How much farther from school does Haley live than Kayla,5
teacher:So whats first thing we notice here;student:I need one more question,5
teacher:How do I get it to a six,5
teacher:How,5
teacher:Now I have one whole and how many fourths left,5
teacher:So if I borrow one hole from this how many Am I borrowing from that,5
teacher:Four and whats four plus one;student:One plus two equals three,5
teacher:What did I do,5
teacher:How much do I have left,5
teacher:Two forths or,5
teacher:Can you explain those to her,5
teacher:If I have one how can I take three away from it,5
teacher:Okay so now what is that,5
teacher:What do I have to do to get 14;student:No,5
teacher:But how many total;student:Thats a whole,5
teacher:Okay Adam Tell me about the process you started,5
teacher:Tell me about the process you started,5
teacher:801 Okay now Im gonna do 10 again who can tell me an easier way to do this,5
teacher:You can talk using partial quotients,5
teacher:What did you do for six divided by three,5
teacher:What is your answer,5
teacher:Okay what did you get for the second,5
teacher:So Kate what did you get for 60 divided by three,5
teacher:2500 divided by 50,5
teacher:And how did you do that;student:I got 50,5
teacher:How did you get What did you get for 600 divided by three,5
teacher:Do I add a zero or attach a zero;student:Because um its the same as 60 Its same as 60 divided by three but you just add a zero,5
teacher:Because we know that 30 times 20 Is,5
teacher:30 times 20 or three times 20 Is what,5
teacher:600 divided by three was,5
teacher:Explain to me what you and your partner did please,5
teacher:Because three times 200 equals,5
teacher:What two division problems could I use,5
teacher:And tell us where you made your mistake,5
teacher:Whats another way I can make 40,5
teacher:And once again its not the way that your parents probably learned how to do it is you just say hey how many times can seven go into 833,5
teacher:So how many more times can seven go into this,5
teacher:And so how many times the seven go into 833,5
teacher:When you add up all of them what do you get,5
teacher:So lets say we want to figure out again how many times does seven go into 833 833,5
teacher:So what you could have said is you could have said Alright my current guess or estimate is 150 times then I could multiply 150 times seven how would I do that,5
teacher:So how many times did it go in,5
teacher:One plus eight is nine plus 110,5
teacher:Were just trying to see how many times can we go in without overshooting it,5
teacher:And then whats left over,5
teacher:So how many more times Can we go in,5
teacher:If you got it correct I want you to explain the method you used,5
teacher:If you got it incorrect I want you to explain your method and tell me where you got it wrong,5
teacher:Okay so show us what you did,5
teacher:How can I write two division problems using those numbers correctly,5
teacher:Six what;student:Six,5
teacher:Three times 200 equals what,5
teacher:Okay Gage what did you get for 5600 divided by 80,5
teacher:If four people split the pie equally how Much pie will each person get,5
teacher:Each person gets how many pieces of pie everybody,5
teacher:put it in that give me your fingers,5
teacher:Show me your fingers,5
teacher:If the three girls split the two pancakes equally what portion of a pancake will each girl get,5
teacher:So how many pieces are each girl going to get,5
teacher:ameesha gets 13 plus 13 equals How much,5
teacher:If they share the squares equally how much will each person get,5
teacher:So Ethan how did you solve this,5
teacher:Okay so explain what you did please,5
teacher:What does that come up with,5
teacher:How much pizza did each person get,5
teacher:So Adam How many people are we splitting this pizza between,5
teacher:What about Mary,5
teacher:Okay so Adam What kind of a picture Could I draw here;student:Yup,5
teacher:How can you cut it into thirds John;student:Well when inauidble I cut the pizza into thirds,5
teacher:John can you explain what you did,5
teacher:Tell me what how you solved this;student:Yes,5
teacher:If I say I cut that pizza into 8 eighths and I have two friends and I want to know how many each of us is going to get how many pieces would each of us get,5
teacher:And I want you to tell me what is 80 times seven,5
teacher:Okay what is 80 times 70,5
teacher:Because you notice when I brought my four down I what that what place value Is that four in,5
teacher:What number do I need to go to before I can actually multiply 15 times something to get close to it,5
teacher:Okay so 15 times what is gonna get me closest to 82,5
teacher:Thats when we say Mrs Strathom has 25 pizzas and she has 10 students how many pieces of pizza will each student get if each pizza has eight pieces,5
teacher:And notice that they just keep going up 14243 fourths dot dot dot all the way up to 16 fourths okay because 16 divided by four everybody is,5
teacher:Okay give me one more set of numbers,5
teacher:Gianna had six carrots to feed his to Jonah sorry had six carrots to feed his two rabbits each rabbit got the same number of carrots how many carrots did each rabbit get,5
teacher:explain to the kids,5
teacher:How many rabbits will go into each cage,5
teacher:Okay Matt can you explain to the class what you did and what order of operations you used,5
teacher:What did your expression look like,5
teacher:because you had to divide those rabbits into,5
teacher:Where did you come up with 8 buddy;student:Yes,5
teacher:How much pizza did each person get,5
teacher:How can I do this using division,5
teacher:What numbers can I add together that are going to give me 40,5
teacher:I could write this down here Olivia,5
teacher:Okay whats another way;student:Yep,5
teacher:How many more Do I need to get to a whole with 914ths;student:A whole,5
teacher:What is the difference between nine and 14;student:I dont know,5
teacher:Whats half of 14,5
teacher:How many do I need piecewise,5
teacher:Okay am I closer to a half or a whole;student:Two,5
teacher:How many total yards would be a good estimate,5
teacher:How does one and a half and a half equal two and a half Adam,5
teacher:How much does he have left,5
teacher:Okay so kirner How am I going to turn one and four sixth into an improper fraction,5
teacher:How am I going to turn one and four sixth into an improper fraction,5
teacher:Where are you coming up,5
teacher:So what would be a good estimate for your answer;student:Then,5
teacher:So now what would be a better estimate;student:Yeah,5
teacher:One and one half minus one,5
teacher:How many total pieces is that one whole worth,5
teacher:Is that closer to a hole or a half,5
teacher:And what is 914ths,5
teacher:one and 714ths is really what,5
teacher:What is it closest to Adam;student:Oh okay,5
teacher:Whats that fraction called,5
teacher:Do you remember how we turn it into an improper fraction,5
teacher:How much is that one worth,5
teacher:How much is that one worth,5
teacher:Its one whole of how many;student:One,5
teacher:How much pizza Do they have total,5
teacher:Okay how did you solve inaudible;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Austin how many pieces is that one whole worth,5
teacher:And then what was your answer,5
teacher:What is the total,5
teacher:So if I have seven and I add five to it what do I have,5
teacher:Okay so Austin how many eights are in that 12,5
teacher:so what are the numbers Adam;student:Its probably,5
teacher:Then what is a reasonable estimate;student:and then 914ths,5
teacher:What is one in 714,5
teacher:What is that closest to,5
teacher:How much pizza do they have in total five eights and seven eighths,5
teacher:Adam how much pizza did each person get,5
teacher:So if you add six to four how much do you have,5
teacher:How many kilometers in all,5
teacher:Thinking of the advisor thinking of the divisor closest to 40,5
teacher:Can you help me with that one Zoe,5
teacher:So Zoe using that divisor come up with an addition problem Thats gonna get me to 40,5
teacher:Okay so what is our closest divisor to 40;student:s31 plus nine,5
teacher:Okay so if I did 36 what do I have to add to it to get to 40,5
teacher:Okay so now lets think about a divisor that using nine How can I divide 36,5
teacher:What would I divide 36 by to get what happens when I divide 36 by four,5
teacher:or 36 by 36 divided by nine,5
teacher:What does that equal,5
teacher:Whats another division problem that I could do to get four,5
teacher:Ben whats a division problem I could do to get me the for more I need to get to 40,5
teacher:what is gonna equal four if I divide it,5
teacher:Two times what equals eight,5
teacher:So if I divide eight divided by two what does that equal,5
teacher:What does that equal,5
teacher:Okay what is another way I could do this,5
teacher:What would that be Zoe,5
teacher:So or using 40 plus nine,5
teacher:What am I Dividing What is an addition problem that I could use to get me closest to 40 Using nine,5
teacher:So Julia what is 818th plus 918ths,5
teacher:What is the top telling me to do with my numerators,5
teacher:So whats eight plus 9,5
teacher:Whats your answer,5
teacher:Do you agree with that or disagree with that;student:together They have two and 712ths cups of grapes,5
teacher:Do you agree or disagree with that,5
teacher:What are the answers;student:I think I agree,5
teacher:10 Sixth minus five sixth,5
teacher:What are my options for answers,5
teacher:Okay what youre looking at is your fraction Ethan is your fraction closer to a half or a whole;student:not the decimal like estimate the fraction,5
teacher:Okay so 18 twentieths is closest to a half or a whole;student:So theres 18 and 20 and then 9 and 20,5
teacher:and nine twentieths is that closer to a half or a whole;student:a whole,5
teacher:So today you are going to start your differences After you know what,5
teacher:Tell me what are multiples of nine up to 50,5
teacher:Okay and lets go one more,5
teacher:so what can I do,5
teacher:What What do I have to choose an answer between Adam,5
teacher:That gives me one 13 plus 13 plus 13 equals what Adam,5
teacher:How much food should Josie give the cat each day,5
teacher:How many days Is she gonna be gone Audrey,5
teacher:So two and 13 so what two whole numbers is two and 13 Victoria;student:Third,5
teacher:What two whole numbers are they between,5
teacher:So what does it fall between;student:inauidble five and a half,5
teacher:Hold up mixed number first,5
teacher:How many threes are in 17;student:Im just guessing,5
teacher:Okay so what does it make it between,5
teacher:How many fours are in 26,5
teacher:Six and how many are leftover;student:Six,5
teacher:So what does it fall between,5
teacher:Explain,5
teacher:Could you come and show us your board,5
teacher:Explain what you did;student:Yup,5
teacher:What are the number models not;student:No because theres inaudible,5
teacher:Ava what did you say,5
teacher:first time either yes or no;student:I said so I said that the one tool is a,5
teacher:Whats the denominator on it,5
teacher:one  Whats the fraction,5
teacher:1 what;student:one,5
teacher:So it would be two and,5
teacher:A zero or a one,5
teacher:A two or three,5
teacher:What are they closer to in regarding whole numbers,5
teacher:two thirds what is it closer to,5
teacher:What are they closer to,5
teacher:one whole or two wholes,5
teacher:Is it closer to two holes three holes,5
teacher:215ths and if I take a whole out of that what do I get;student:Thats what I did,5
teacher:So its what is it between,5
teacher:Is it between one and two,5
teacher:between three and four,5
teacher:Whats the mix number of five halves,5
teacher:And last but certainly not least Harmony can you explain number three,5
teacher:Okay how many threes are in seven,5
teacher:How many sets of three are in seven,5
teacher:So right now we know that we have two with how many leftover,5
teacher:what is the benchmark,5
teacher:Are they closer to a one or a two,5
teacher:What would be the fraction,5
teacher:Go ahead explain,5
teacher:What is that top number called;student:And then I got and then I put one of the wholes,5
teacher:starts with an N,5
teacher:Landon show us what you got,5
teacher:Whats one more;student:Theres another one,5
teacher:And what is four fourths plus four fourths,5
teacher:How many wholes,5
teacher:Now how many do I need to show this,5
teacher:How many total fourth pieces do I have,5
teacher:Okay because if I do four times two what does that equal;student:Yes,5
teacher:And how many Do I have to add to eight to get 11;student:inauidble,5
teacher:So its telling you if Im doing this how many,5
teacher:How many do I can I do that,5
teacher:Show me how you did that using thirds;student:4 and two thirds,5
teacher:Okay now show me 14 thirds in those;student:Okay,5
teacher:How many is that;student:Okay,5
teacher:And howd you get 113rds;student:Oh sorry 113rds,5
teacher:Show me what you got first,5
teacher:Gage what did you get,5
teacher:Is it asking you it can give a mixed number or an improper fraction,5
teacher:How many did you subtract,5
teacher:To get the two wholes,5
teacher:Okay answer what did you have,5
teacher:What did you have Harmony,5
teacher:Okay tell me how you got two and 115th,5
teacher:how did you get two and 115ths;student:And she said no you couldnt put it into two because I got 2 and eleven fifths,5
teacher:What did you have first for your answer,5
teacher:Okay two as my whole number two and what would my fraction be;student:Using what,5
teacher:When it was your turn to share what did you share,5
teacher:5 times one is,5
teacher:five times two is;student:Five,5
teacher:five times three is;student:Ten,5
teacher:five times four is;student:Fifteen,5
teacher:If I take it in four times how much do I have left;student:Twenty,5
teacher:What is another name for three and two thirds that has the denominator three,5
teacher:Its three but what is another name,5
teacher:Because how many times does five go into 21,5
teacher:Whats half way,5
teacher:What do they fit between,5
teacher:Put your fingers up,5
teacher:Remember who can tell me what our daily affirmation was this morningWhat was it,5
teacher:I dont,5
teacher:And then Connor what did you do for number three buddy,5
teacher:Think of what should be your denominator what is the number of people I am sharing them with,5
teacher:And what is it that I am sharing,5
teacher:What would the fraction of three containers of paint shared by 10 people be,5
teacher:Okay what would two cartons of orange juice be shared by nine people,5
teacher:And what would six apples shared by eight people be,5
teacher:Okay Ben what did you do for three containers of paint shared by 10 people,5
teacher:How did you get three thirds;student:I did three thirds,5
teacher:And what do you need to do to fix it and explain it to me now,5
teacher:Tom would you or Ben would you explain that again to me please,5
teacher:Tell me what you did for the second one,5
teacher:Harper what did you do for the third one,5
teacher:Explain what you did sir,5
teacher:What made you think four fourths,5
teacher:Okay Layla do number two,5
teacher:What would that fraction be,5
teacher:What would that fraction look like,5
teacher:What do I need to turn those cans into,5
teacher:What How am I cutting them into fractions,5
teacher:Im asking how many pieces are going to be an each can,5
teacher:How many days is she gonna be gone Reese,5
teacher:so what do I need to divide these cans into;student:Five,5
teacher:What am I dividing those cans into,5
teacher:What do I need to divide these cans into,5
teacher:And one of them had run one and a half miles where would that be on my number line,5
teacher:Day 4 is going to get 123 day five is going to get 123 So what is my answer,5
teacher:Three what Everybody,5
teacher:How many days Is she going to be gone Adam;student:cuz you put three cans and theirs five in each,5
teacher:Well Adam if you had 5 10 15 pieces and you divided it by three what do you get;student:So I dont um I thought it was 15th because I thought we Were doing addition but is this like division or something,5
teacher:But five days and how many parts of each can did she get,5
teacher:So if Im renaming a fraction and its a whole its a improper fraction how do I rename it into a mixed number,5
teacher:And if I rename it I look how many sets of 11 how many sets of seven can I get out of 11,5
teacher:Look at the fraction and figure out oh well how many fractions do I need to answer this problem,5
teacher:They each day got three of how many,5
teacher:So if I rename rename a mixed number Elijah what is that called,5
teacher:Where would that be,5
teacher:Can you come show me where one and a half miles would be up here on this number line,5
teacher:First of all how do you rename a fraction,5
teacher:How can I use a number line to help me rename an improper fraction,5
teacher:How can I use a number line to help me rename an improper fraction,5
teacher:Elijah tell us what you think,5
teacher:Can you use the fraction names;student:But what I could add is like when you Yeah like its like you can see,5
teacher:Can you talk about the fraction pieces the size,5
teacher:And what is it closer to;student:And then Lenna ran seven sixths because you can see the one and then theres one more six,5
teacher:Go ahead and talk about how you solve these,5
teacher:Whose plant is taller,5
teacher:Tell me where I should circle,5
teacher:Where should I put a dot,5
teacher:Okay am I talking about Rachel or am I talking about Dan,5
teacher:So William take me up to the half,5
teacher:How many total halves do I have on my line,5
teacher:How many ticks do I have left,5
teacher:Who ran further,5
teacher:Or not Nate Tom would you come and label those,5
teacher:I would like those of you that are done to answer questions C who ran farther,5
teacher:Then two thirds then three thirds or a whole then four thirds which is one and a third and five thirds which is one and two thirds and six thirds which is,5
teacher:What is three halves of a mile,5
teacher:So what would three halves be do you think,5
teacher:Because three halves is really;student:The same place as Landon said,5
teacher:Where do you think come show me where you think that would be,5
teacher:Where do you think three fourths of a mile would be,5
teacher:I want you to think is three fourth mile,5
teacher:Okay where do you think it would be,5
teacher:Where would that be,5
teacher:Go ahead point,5
teacher:Okay William do you know how to divide it,5
teacher:What am I dividing it into,5
teacher:How many pieces do you need in each,5
teacher:What would my zero be,5
teacher:Zero what;student:Zero,5
teacher:Now what would that one be,5
teacher:Or what would it be in a fraction;student:Thats one,5
teacher:Who ran farther,5
teacher:So we have two thirds this way and we have two thirds this way so we know that two thirds of two thirds and Anna do you have the answer,5
teacher:Anybody have what what can we start off with Josh,5
teacher:So then what did you do after that Joey,5
teacher:How do you remember that median is the middle and mean is the add them all up and divide by how many there are,5
teacher:Is there any other time in your life where youve heard the word median;student:Because its mean to divide them,5
teacher:What do you call that strip of grass in the middle of the highway,5
teacher:How would I make 3x equal to zero,5
teacher:What is the xintercept,5
teacher:Again what do we do,5
teacher:What is going to make the numerator equal to zero,5
teacher:Vertical asymptote what do we do,5
teacher:What makes that equal to zero,5
teacher:Which of the following has a removal discontinuity,5
teacher:This factors x and x I need two numbers that multiply to give me 10,5
teacher:Which of the following functions does not have a horizontal asymptote,5
teacher:In this one what wins,5
teacher:Top or bottom,5
teacher:What wins here,5
teacher:But first you have to put them in what,5
teacher:This one which one wins,5
teacher:What does median mean,5
teacher:Show us what youve got,5
teacher:How many should it go up to on this side,5
teacher:This kid who had 10 on him should he go in the 010 bar or in the 1020 bar,5
teacher:What did we say right back here,5
teacher:Numbers that are on the edge what,5
teacher:Where does this kid go,5
teacher:Where does this kid go,5
teacher:Where does this kid go,5
teacher:What about this one,5
teacher:Where does that kid go,5
teacher:Where does the 26 kid go,5
teacher:Where does the 50 kid go,5
teacher:What if I did this,5
teacher:What if I made it be just one big bar,5
teacher:If I go from 0 to 55 and its just one where does this guy go;student:You got to get estimate,5
teacher:Whats the first thing we do on every problem;student:more addition or subtraction problems,5
teacher:Now how do you make sure you dont mix up mean with median,5
teacher:This one its a what,5
teacher:Whats the first thing we do on every problem in this unit every time,5
teacher:What is the removable discontinuity of that guy,5
teacher:What value would make just x be zero,5
teacher:Where is the vertical asymptote,5
teacher:At zero and where is x0,5
teacher:Where are you when x0,5
teacher:When x0 where are you on the graph,5
teacher:Well yes but describe where you would be on the graph,5
teacher:If I went to  where would I be,5
teacher:x equal,5
teacher:What did we just say that it didnt have,5
teacher:Then when we said What is the vertical asymptote,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:If you put a circle on a grid and you put a dot on that circle no matter where you are at as that dot goes around the circle whats not going to change,5
teacher:What should always be true no matter where youre at around the circle,5
teacher:What do we want,5
teacher:Whats left in the denominator,5
teacher:When you cancel out those factors and look for the vertical asymptote where is the vertical asymptote,5
teacher:Which is,5
teacher:What is happening here,5
teacher:That cancels out choice D and choice C Now what do I do with that Rob,5
teacher:Yes plug this into the reduce and that gives us 1 over 3 so the right answer is;student:You take x 1 and  and then you do one divided  or like minus two,5
teacher:All that means is as that function goes out and out and out part of the right or part of the left what is it doing,5
teacher:If you graph were asking you way over here add an x of 1 trillion or something what is the function doing,5
teacher:At the ends of the function all the way to the left at negative infinity and all the way at the right at positive infinity what is the function doing,5
teacher:What does it mean to when I say at positive 1 trillion,5
teacher:What is this graph doing as I go far far far far,5
teacher:How many people does that person represent,5
teacher:Its getting closer and closer and closer to the xaxis or y0 but is it ever getting,5
teacher:What are we concerned about,5
teacher:What is the horizontal asymptote at yab look like,5
teacher:What does this look like,5
teacher:What is it doing,5
teacher:Look in blue if I draw in that horizontal asymptote whats the keyword,5
teacher:Whats the keyword here,5
teacher:What is this word mean,5
teacher:As I go forever in this direction whats it doing;student:No,5
teacher:Should they go here or here,5
teacher:This kid who had 8 in their pocket where should they go,5
teacher:What did I count by here,5
teacher:Where are we going,5
teacher:Just read one of them;student:Can I just read both of them or just one of them,5
teacher:Where did you see that;student:Yes,5
teacher:One of the things were going to learn next week is how weird do you have to be to be considered an outlier;student:Watch him walk in and be like Hey man youre weird,5
teacher:Who was this,5
teacher:Who is this,5
teacher:Okay whats another one,5
teacher:You guys say one of yours,5
teacher:Whats another intelligent thing to say about the comparison of these two classes,5
teacher:You guys tell me one of yours,5
teacher:All right guys in the back do you guys have one;student:Yes it could happen I guess,5
teacher:Ellis whatd you say,5
teacher:What is it about the data that tells you they hit their growth spurt earlier,5
teacher:Do you want to come up here and show me what youre talking about,5
teacher:Come on show me what youre talking about;student:Sorry,5
teacher:If you put them in order how many numbers do you have,5
teacher:Where are you putting all of these numbers,5
teacher:Are we going to make a bar graph of this or are we going to make a histogram of this,5
teacher:Theres nine fish tanks I counted so how many bricks should I have in my wall here,5
teacher:Can you come up and pick your paper and were going to look at the first one and just kind of see if we can come to a consensus of what the actual answer is and how did you arrive there,5
teacher:Can you share what you did,5
teacher:Because Liams choosing between two school backpacks the black one weighs one and 58 pounds the blue one weighs two and 18 pounds which one weighs more how much more,5
teacher:Did you do something different did you do the same thing how did you model,5
teacher:So  would actually be willing to share that,5
teacher:Maybe you did a little differently so Maddy can you share what you did,5
teacher:What did you realize about this;student:No  so I started off with 10 and 14 because I  off with and then I looked at it and I thought it was one then I worked with 1 and 34 because I was just added up like yours I got 11,5
teacher:Could you make a statement about which class was taller than the other class,5
teacher:We should get to hear what you guys are thinking of this one so maybe you already had it okay Ryan can you share what you did,5
teacher:This  11 Logan what do you notice,5
teacher:Good and what do you notice about where its written;student:When mine is 11 we took the one and made it 44,5
teacher:How would you want to write it Ryan;student:Once you notice that you have ten,5
teacher:This fish tank that had 20 fish in it where should that bar go,5
teacher:Where does this 37 one go,5
teacher:29 where does that one get stacked in,5
teacher:Heres what you should do what does this nine represent,5
teacher:Yes everybody look up here what do you notice about this;student:I did  and one was minus 10 one was because 11 people say  and then,5
teacher:Somebody from this section would volunteer to try to put it into words,5
teacher:Which class do you think on average was taller than the other class,5
teacher:While I pass out your note catcher I want you guys to turn and talk what does that make you think of,5
teacher:What does the other one have on the xaxis,5
teacher:What are we going to get if I ask you what your favorite color is,5
teacher:A big list of what,5
teacher:What kind of data is it going to be,5
teacher:What if instead of that I ask you this,5
teacher:What if we said how old are you,5
teacher:Look what is the essential difference between me asking you this question and me asking you this question,5
teacher:What did you respond with here,5
teacher:What are these things,5
teacher:What are these things,5
teacher:Which one of these would I make a bar graph out of,5
teacher:What would I make for this one,5
teacher:How many people did I talk to;student:You never asked me,5
teacher:What did I count by here,5
teacher:I labeled it frequency and I counted by what Kumar,5
teacher:What do you mean by that,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:Whats another way that theyre different,5
teacher:Whats another way other than these guys are separated out from each other and these guys are together,5
teacher:Somebody tell me what does the word histogram make you think of,5
teacher:Whats another word that it makes you think of;student:Yes,5
teacher:What are the similarities and differences between how bar graphs and histograms look and also what kind of data is used on there,5
teacher:How are bar graphs and histograms the same and how are they different,5
teacher:Tell me a way in which these are the same as that,5
teacher:I would call those maybe not lines because theyre What would you call that,5
teacher:What shape is it,5
teacher:Whose middle person was taller,5
teacher:Write it up there Adriana,5
teacher:What do you mean by that,5
teacher:We would say theyre together for the histograms which means what;student:The histograms are all together,5
teacher:Theyre separated where;student:Yes,5
teacher:Whats another same,5
teacher:Where do you see that they both have numbers,5
teacher:What do you mean;student:The histograms are not accepted,5
teacher:Tell me more about what you mean by that;student:They are not exactly with all the numbers,5
teacher:What about this,5
teacher:Would you be willing to share this with the class,5
teacher:For what are you testing them;student:Actually you just did a ton of test numbers basically two three 10,5
teacher:As the denominator of a fraction gets bigger what happens to the value of the fraction,5
teacher:Two two two two two and then what happens,5
teacher:What did they do,5
teacher:What are they trying to tell you,5
teacher:Whats wrong with this one;student:It goes 2 4 6 18,5
teacher:How wide is this bar,5
teacher:How wide is this bar,5
teacher:How wide is this bar,5
teacher:If I said I live in a town and here was the temperatures over the course of the year what was the coldest it ever got where I live,5
teacher:What is the hottest it ever got,5
teacher:Whats wrong with what they did here,5
teacher:The average could be zero but what,5
teacher:These count by what,5
teacher:What do these count by,5
teacher:Whats wrong with it,5
teacher:In math one if somebody gives you that graph theyre lying to you and you cant,5
teacher:Whats the thing that would make you lose points if you did this in a math class,5
teacher:What does a high school graduate make compared to a nonhigh school graduate over their course of their lifetime,5
teacher:What is the thing that you would lose points for it if you made this graph in a math class,5
teacher:Whats going on up here,5
teacher:In 1998 what was the value of the home,5
teacher:In 1999 what did it go up to,5
teacher:What does this graph make you think happened to the home prices,5
teacher:How tall is this bar,5
teacher:What is this graph telling you,5
teacher:Theyre trying to send you the message that home prices did what,5
teacher:Look at what happened to the average cost what are they trying to make you think and then how do they mislead you and whats wrong with this,5
teacher:What are they trying to tell you,5
teacher:What are they trying to make you think,5
teacher:What happened to how much it costs to go to college,5
teacher:If you took this bar right here and moved it over to this biggest bar what does it look like it happened to it,5
teacher:How did they mislead you,5
teacher:Where did they start the scale,5
teacher:What probably should they have started the scale at,5
teacher:At a glance what does it look like the wages of the fast food restaurant did,5
teacher:Whats the problem with this,5
teacher:What x is that,5
teacher:3 so this thing doesn t exist at 3 and again it doesn t exist at 5 so you need a way to tell me if I ask you this question all real numbers except 4,5
teacher:If I gave you a graph and ask you a different question where is f  0,5
teacher:What does it say X squared plus,5
teacher:X squared is equal to,5
teacher:What does it say X2Y2 is equal to,5
teacher:Whats the sine of the green dot,5
teacher:Whats the sine of the green dot;student:Oh dear,5
teacher:What is the cosine of the red dot,5
teacher:What is the cosine of the red dot,5
teacher:What is the tangent of the blue dot;student:Zero,5
teacher:Whats the tangent of the blue dot,5
teacher:If I ask for the tangent of the blue dot you would say this thing on top of that thing and anything divided by itself is,5
teacher:A positive divided by a negative is;student:One,5
teacher:Whats the tangent of the purple dot;student:Maybe,5
teacher:Tangent of the purple dot,5
teacher:Whats the tangent of the purple dot;student:Its just one,5
teacher:Somebody want to come up and do this one,5
teacher:X squared plus Y squared is equal to what,5
teacher:X2Y2,5
teacher:What do you know about the sides of a right triangle,5
teacher:What kind of triangle is this thing right here,5
teacher:What if we made it instead of a strict inequality we made it something like  or,5
teacher:You could go like this and what did I do,5
teacher:If you can get a rational function so that it looks like a fraction equals a fraction a rational equation what s the way that we solve that,5
teacher:Cross,5
teacher:What would make that be zero,5
teacher:How can you tell just by looking at this what the yintercept is,5
teacher:If I could factor that friend I would get  which would tell me,5
teacher:Were going to play Whats wrong with this display,5
teacher:Square this side were going to get one times one which is one and outside is going to be one times  so thats negative two you have one minus,5
teacher:When is sine defined as around the unit circle,5
teacher:Y over,5
teacher:because for a unit circle whats the value of our R,5
teacher:What is cosine,5
teacher:so the question will be,5
teacher:What do you think we could do next,5
teacher:What should we do next,5
teacher:516 63,5
teacher:If you took a quiz and you all got 10 on it and I tripled your score youd all get what,5
teacher:The measures of the variation did what,5
teacher:When I added 10 what did all the measures of center do,5
teacher:Yes what is this called right here;student:So,5
teacher:Okay how about this one,5
teacher:For this one the  behavior is a  what has the relative figure power numerator versus denominator,5
teacher:What is this trying to get across to you,5
teacher:Say something intelligent  about this;student:That in 1999 there was a house price like the price,5
teacher:All right tell me something intelligent about this;student:I said  The houses in 1999 were made way more expensive,5
teacher:All right what increased,5
teacher:All right tell me something intelligent about this;student:It increased a lot,5
teacher:Tell me something intelligent about that;student:Does that say 80000,5
teacher:Tell me something intelligent about that,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:All right tell me something about this,5
teacher:What;student:Yes,5
teacher:Okay what happened,5
teacher:Whats happening,5
teacher:Where does it live on the right side of the asymptote,5
teacher:I got five The reason why Im hitting this again is I got like five people during that little work time who were telling me that you couldnt cross the horizontal,5
teacher:All right where can you not cross the horizontal asymptote,5
teacher:Is it low or is it high,5
teacher:Come on up here say what you think,5
teacher:When youre plotting in giant numbers like a number in my bank account like a trillion and you put a one trillion what are seven and nine compared to a trillion,5
teacher:What is a trillion to the third power,5
teacher:What is the biggest number and the only thing that really matters,5
teacher:What does this group say about what happens when the denominator of a fraction gets bigger,5
teacher:Yes this is a big but the bigness of this compared to the bigness of this means this is the only thing thats important and  anything divided by a giant number it gets closer and closer and closer to,5
teacher:Whats happening here,5
teacher:What happened from original to  in general the;student:Everything was the same,5
teacher:What would the trillion squareds do,5
teacher:What happens to a fraction when the numerator gets bigger quicker than the bottom,5
teacher:In order to find y what do I have to do,5
teacher:Whats bothering me,5
teacher:Who can decode my acronym,5
teacher:Always What do we always do in this unit,5
teacher:Always Factor Everything No Matter What or Else,5
teacher:The question is is the butterfly wing here or is the butterfly wing up here,5
teacher:If I could take the smartboard and flip it upside down were not having the bottom win were now going to have what,5
teacher:Whats happening to this fraction,5
teacher:Tell me what happened,5
teacher:By what;student:S,5
teacher:What do your measures of spread do,5
teacher:What was the mode here;student:Do the mean,5
teacher:When every kid did twice as good what happened to the mean,5
teacher:It went from 358 to what,5
teacher:The median went from 355 to,5
teacher:All of these did what,5
teacher:What did my hands do for the first story,5
teacher:Watch what happened when you doubled numbers,5
teacher:What happened to my hands,5
teacher:They also did what;student:Yes,5
teacher:In this case these should also do what,5
teacher:This is what,5
teacher:When a real number K is added underline that to each value the measures of the new data set can be found by,5
teacher:In that first one what was K,5
teacher:Everybody got how many extra credit points,5
teacher:That when you add the same thing to all of your data what do your measures of center do,5
teacher:What is the conclusion here,5
teacher:What did my class do,5
teacher:What happened is the standard deviation,5
teacher:What happened with the measures of spread,5
teacher:What happened,5
teacher:What happened to the measures of center,5
teacher:What happened to the measures of center,5
teacher:What happened to the measures of center when I gave everybody 10 extra points,5
teacher:By;student:They raised,5
teacher:What happened to the measures of spread;student:10,5
teacher:What happened with the measures of center,5
teacher:You then wiped the calculator and you redid it for this and these numbers turned into what,5
teacher:If I scooted it up by 10 what should the measures of center do,5
teacher:If I said next test I give everybody 20 points of extra credit what should happen to the class average,5
teacher:What was the range,5
teacher:What was the IQR,5
teacher:What was the standard deviation,5
teacher:Now when I gave everybody or they retook the test and everybody did 10 points better what happened to the range,5
teacher:What happened to the IQR,5
teacher:What did I basically do to everybodys data;student:No,5
teacher:Where is three pie over four should I go up or go down,5
teacher:Can you read what you wrote on number three,5
teacher:What did you do differently,5
teacher:Can you show it the other way we just learned,5
teacher:Does anyone want to share how they got 10 as the denominator,5
teacher:What would I do here,5
teacher:How do we get there,5
teacher:How much of the gray did they shade in all,5
teacher:I want you to think about this and really what is 410,5
teacher:Explain what you did,5
teacher:What did you think about this,5
teacher:What did we actually do,5
teacher:Turn and tell a neighbor what did we actually do here,5
teacher:How did we get 40100,5
teacher:What would you do about solving this problem,5
teacher:If you add 13  13 how much is that,5
teacher:What word is that,5
teacher:What will be the equation here,5
teacher:I,5
teacher:Can you come up with an equation that show,5
teacher:Instead of multiplying to find my denominator what did I do,5
teacher:100  what is 10,5
teacher:How do I do this,5
teacher:If this has 100 at the bottom Grayson how would I do that,5
teacher:10 x what is 100,5
teacher:10 x what is 100,5
teacher:2 x 10 is;student:10,5
teacher:Now I can add 20100   What was I adding,5
teacher:Can anyone share what they got for Number 1,5
teacher:Justin what did you write,5
teacher:Number 2,5
teacher:Who can tell me what they see on Number 2,5
teacher:Logan what do you notice,5
teacher:Logan can you explain how you did Number 2,5
teacher:Do you always have to make it 100 or could you go to 10,5
teacher:How would you do that though,5
teacher:Over here if I get a 10 I can get an equivalent fraction so instead of multiplying what am I going to be doing,5
teacher:What is 90  10,5
teacher:Ms Tolliver What fraction is this,5
teacher:Can we think of anything that 8 and 3 can be divided into,5
teacher:How can you prove its correct,5
teacher:What are these;student:Yes those,5
teacher:What fraction could they get,5
teacher:Really what is our whole that the three daughters are sharing,5
teacher:How much,5
teacher:Julia do you want to come up and share,5
teacher:What color is the 16 piece,5
teacher:Shes saying 13 of the 12 and the other two get What do you think Julia,5
teacher:Well how much is left over;student:Left over,5
teacher:Jake can you come up and share what your thoughts are about this,5
teacher:Maybe share what you did,5
teacher:can you share what you did,5
teacher:Can you explain what you did,5
teacher:What denominator did you use;student:No,5
teacher:If I write them out like this what denominator did you use,5
teacher:What do you end up with,5
teacher:Ryan what are you thinking,5
teacher:Anybody with me that has an idea of what Im going to do for the other two sisters,5
teacher:Is 815 more or less than 12,5
teacher:What would I have to do,5
teacher:What argument can you make to prove its correct,5
teacher:Logan can you please explain,5
teacher:How could we say that 23 is more than and we only had 12;student:Then I found out that 1 13 would cover 12 and I know that 23 is not half,5
teacher:What was the key piece of information from Logan showing you his fraction circles,5
teacher:Now how do I really prove it and explain it,5
teacher:Can you explain what you did there,5
teacher:Can you share what we said would prove it,5
teacher:How do you get that same denominator,5
teacher:Who else from my group can explain what we arrived with,5
teacher:Lucas do you want to come up and share what we came up with in our group,5
teacher:Do you remember what we decided we could do,5
teacher:Did anyone figure out what you actually could do,5
teacher:Owen can you share what really you could do,5
teacher:What do we have here,5
teacher:Anybody see what might work here,5
teacher:How much is 26,5
teacher:What did we come up with instead of 13,5
teacher:Grayson can you share the rule for everybody,5
teacher:Who remembers the rule,5
teacher:Can you give me an example;student:You can only add the numerator together if the denominator is the same,5
teacher:We know Mr Swanson how many violins did he have,5
teacher:How many students is that about when we say 19,5
teacher:How many is it about,5
teacher:What do you think we need o figure it out,5
teacher:How many strings go with each violin for each student what will we do,5
teacher:That gives us how many strings for each person,5
teacher:For each violin,5
teacher:How much did one set of string cost,5
teacher:What can work,5
teacher:How much is he going to spend the first two,5
teacher:How much will be one set of strings,5
teacher:How much would one set cost,5
teacher:Do one of my friends who I was working with want to share what we did in the beginning and how we didnt use it at all,5
teacher:Ella what did you arrive at for your answer,5
teacher:For two sets of streams thats 16 per student and you are going to be taking 16 times 9 to get how much money,5
teacher:Can you come up with an equation,5
teacher:Then the last part would be what Charlie,5
teacher:Do you see something else I should highlight Ella,5
teacher:Do you see something else,5
teacher:What is two times three,5
teacher:What would be the area,5
teacher:How much money will he have left after he buys the book,5
teacher:How much does one package cost,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:If you buy six packages what are you going to do to figure your problem,5
teacher:Before we start Kennedy can you share with everybody what Mrs Tolliver said about the steps,5
teacher:What would the fraction that look like,5
teacher:Whats something that helped you when you thought about this problem,5
teacher:Whats 5 x 6,5
teacher:I want to know what you did,5
teacher:Kennedy do you want to share how you got 50;student:Yes,5
teacher:Who can share something I should highlight in my problem,5
teacher:What would be some important information,5
teacher:Rynn what would be one,5
teacher:Another piece Chase,5
teacher:Were going to put it under the doc camera and share the steps,5
teacher:Mia can you share,5
teacher:Two and one fourth how many fourth pieces is that,5
teacher:Im trying to think of how many fourth pieces is this,5
teacher:Turn and tell your neighbor what do you do,5
teacher:What is the first rule for adding mixed numbers,5
teacher:Im going to pull a card and I want you to tell me if they have the same denominator whats a really easy way to add mixed numbers the very first step a very easy way to add mixed numbers,5
teacher:Landon what do we do,5
teacher:Somebody have another strategy for solving mixed number edition,5
teacher:How long is the line segment now,5
teacher:What is the whole of this story and can you figure out the answer,5
teacher:Can it be done and how,5
teacher:I saw some that have 47100 as their answer and Im not going to say if its right or wrong yet but does someone want to share what they did,5
teacher:Can you think of a way to share and an easy way that they could get 20100;student:I said that it was 20100 in gold because 210 is 15 of 100 so that means that 20100 is 15 of 100,5
teacher:what is that rule for coming up with an equivalent fraction,5
teacher:What is that rule,5
teacher:I know its not this now because they dont have what;student:How do you know,5
teacher:Who thinks they can tell the class and they remembered what that rule was where I put my fractions in the same denominator,5
teacher:Who knows the rule,5
teacher:What do you do,5
teacher:What is one plus one plus one,5
teacher:Turn and tell our neighbor maybe how you revise your thinking for those problems,5
teacher:What did you have down here,5
teacher:What would be another way to say two and one fourth,5
teacher:Do I have a volunteer to come up and explain what you did and then were going to either add on if you have something else you tried but does anybody want to share what they did,5
teacher:First of all what would the answer be and what did you do to figure it out,5
teacher:How many pieces is two and one fourth,5
teacher:Summer would you be willing to share what you did first,5
teacher:Can you explain what you did,5
teacher:What will be the improper fraction,5
teacher:Can you represent it with a picture,5
teacher:How many pieces,5
teacher:Wow and what is that bottom called;student:I added 11 to three and I got 24 and then I just left the bottom like we learned the other day and and I got,5
teacher:Can anybody think of what question Mrs Tolliver might be wondering,5
teacher:Im wondering how did you get this fractions here,5
teacher:How many fifths make one whole,5
teacher:How many fifths make one whole,5
teacher:If you have two whole how many pieces would be in two wholes and then how did the,5
teacher:Nick can you explain what you did,5
teacher:What are you really going to be doing,5
teacher:How was it different,5
teacher:What did we figure out,5
teacher:What is the right answer,5
teacher:If we do 10X2 is 20 and 20X9 is what,5
teacher:What are the numbers to make it easier in my head,5
teacher:If we wanted the tap dancers to perform for six hours how much would it cost,5
teacher:How do we get to six hours,5
teacher:If you are drawing a picture where is the clue where that tells you what it is,5
teacher:What do you need to know,5
teacher:How do you do it,5
teacher:How does it connect with yesterday,5
teacher:Talk about what you think you might do or what you need to know to solve this,5
teacher:What are they looking for,5
teacher:Find a partner share what youve started and what you think you need to do,5
teacher:How do you do the area of a rectangle,5
teacher:How do you figure out the area of a rectangle,5
teacher:What are you missing,5
teacher:I need a friend who is willing to help come up and share and explain what they did,5
teacher:What did you guys get,5
teacher:Were going to have a little discussion about how you figure this out,5
teacher:How much would baked potatoes costs,5
teacher:Okay so right now just somewhere on your notebook I would like you to figure out how much a package of if I wanted to do baked potatoes how much would that cost,5
teacher:Anyone want to explain what they did to estimate,5
teacher:Jake what did you do,5
teacher:Then what would 22 equals to,5
teacher:What would the other one be,5
teacher:What would the other one be,5
teacher:What can we round to,5
teacher:He said we can just keep it as a four and what else would it be;student:keep it as four,5
teacher:What key words did you hear;student:How much would it cost to buy the burritos and the sandwiches,5
teacher:When I hear and in my head Im thinking Im going to subtract or add at the end,5
teacher:Do I have a friend who can share what they did on this one,5
teacher:Can you explain how you got 57;student:I got 57,5
teacher:Okay Owen can you share what you did,5
teacher:Whatd you get for your answer,5
teacher:What did you get,5
teacher:Whats 5x6,5
teacher:How much would it cost if I wanted to do baked potatoes,5
teacher:What are they looking for,5
teacher:What do you know,5
teacher:How does it connect to yesterday,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Okay Steven what did you get;student:I respectfully disagree because I think your addition is wrong because 31  2927 I just said is,5
teacher:Okay so well give you a second to fix that and so basically on A I like how youve explained how you divided did everybody divide to get an answer okay when you divided what did you get;student:Yes,5
teacher:Okay Steven can you share what we did here with the picture,5
teacher:When you did your revised thinking what did you come up with for your answer,5
teacher:With those extra remainders what did you guys do with them,5
teacher:Excellent and so thinking about interpreting remainders what did you guys do with those;student:I went for,5
teacher:Can you explain how you did that Owen,5
teacher:How many baskets go in each box,5
teacher:Oh explain what you did Victoria,5
teacher:Owen you just went right to what,5
teacher:What was your equation that you did,5
teacher:I want you guys to just talk about how was that different with what you did with the remainder;student:It would only have three,5
teacher:How did you interpret the remainder for this one,5
teacher:How is it different,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Can you guys come up and share what you discussed and talked about;student:Connor,5
teacher:Then your answer would be what,5
teacher:Youre using what;student:We could  side by taking out the zero and,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:What did you do next,5
teacher:Anyone have anything they want to add or explain,5
teacher:What do you always start with,5
teacher:What do you start with Everett,5
teacher:What is the formula for the area,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:Can anyone share my equation might be down here for estimation how would I estimate this,5
teacher:Tell them what is the formula for finding the area,5
teacher:Hudson how do you figure out the area,5
teacher:How did they get 450,5
teacher:What is the formula,5
teacher:Whats the formula though;student:Because they know 9,5
teacher:Right now I want you to turn and tell someone how do you figure out the missing sign,5
teacher:what do you do,5
teacher:Victoria how do we go about doing this,5
teacher:How do you do that,5
teacher:Now the hard part is how do I estimate,5
teacher:Can you explain how you got 63;student:Yes,5
teacher:Owen what are we multiplying,5
teacher:Can anyone at team number seven tell the class where could you have the hands to make a right angle on a clock,5
teacher:Where would the hands be,5
teacher:What if we did this,5
teacher:I had 90 and then what did I do,5
teacher:How much is that,5
teacher:Then if I go another 90 whats 180  90,5
teacher:Then if I go all the way around its a;student:270,5
teacher:If you made one full rotation where are the positions of the straws,5
teacher:Where are the positions of the hands,5
teacher:Where would the straws be,5
teacher:If I start at 12 where would a halfturn be,5
teacher:Where would a halfturn be,5
teacher:Make a 90 Where is a quarter turn,5
teacher:How many quarters are there in the clock,5
teacher:What kind of angle is that,5
teacher:Where would the hands need to be to make some right angles,5
teacher:Can we figure out,5
teacher:Where would the hands have to be to make some right angles,5
teacher:How many degrees is a circle,5
teacher:What is the right answer,5
teacher:What did you come up with,5
teacher:Which ones are the 18s,5
teacher:Whats 18  18,5
teacher:Whats 14  14,5
teacher:Is it close to zero or close to one;student:Yes,5
teacher:Think about get an answer do you think A or B is bigger,5
teacher:What kind of angle do we have,5
teacher:How about number 12,5
teacher:What are you thinking,5
teacher:What part of the angle is actually bigger,5
teacher:What are these called when we talk about geometry;student:The,5
teacher:What are those,5
teacher:What is the name for this angle,5
teacher:What is the vocabulary word for that angle,5
teacher:What did you make,5
teacher:What do you think Steven,5
teacher:What would 12 be,5
teacher:They want to know how many whole wedges fit into the angle,5
teacher:How did you fit the pieces in there,5
teacher:What do you think that were learning,5
teacher:What do you think were learning today,5
teacher:What are you thinking,5
teacher:Julia would you be willing to come put your work under the dock camera;student:Yes,5
teacher:Do you want to share what you got or how did you do it,5
teacher:Can you show what your actual equation is;student:This one can be estimated,5
teacher:What did you actually get for your equation,5
teacher:Can you explain to everybody what you multiplied,5
teacher:Looking at this When you look at the tumblers and singing group what did you multiply,5
teacher:If you could tell everybody the strategy what do you do,5
teacher:We can all agree and we figured out the tumblers but it says how much more would it cost to hire the tumblers and the singing group,5
teacher:When we hear how much more what do you automatically think in your head how much more,5
teacher:Right now can you come up with your equation for this singing group,5
teacher:Can someone share that second part what would be the second equation,5
teacher:Were talking about the singers now we know were multiplying what are we multiplying,5
teacher:Dan how do we start math today,5
teacher:Can anyone share how we started math today that is a little bit different than normal,5
teacher:What do you think that means,5
teacher:Mia what did you think about number five,5
teacher:Anyone want to share what they thought,5
teacher:Come up and demonstrate and share and then Ill have you talk about how you did,5
teacher:Can you explain what that is,5
teacher:Does anybody have something to share for the second one,5
teacher:This is how much of the fourth wedge is inside the angle;student:I already,5
teacher:Who can share that,5
teacher:What did you think about with your partner,5
teacher:About how much the fourth wedge is inside the angle and about how many purple wedges fit in the angle,5
teacher:what were you thinking,5
teacher:Measurement one what wedge is this piece,5
teacher:What measure is this one,5
teacher:Is it clockwise or counterclockwise,5
teacher:Next one;student:Clockwise,5
teacher:Next one,5
teacher:How are those different from the other ones,5
teacher:How are they different,5
teacher:Show me angles,5
teacher:All right 19 pie over six,5
teacher:this is trig speak for same what,5
teacher:Who wants to put that one at the spot where it has the same sign;student:Yes,5
teacher:The whole familys splitting four pizzas how many pieces would they each get,5
teacher:All right now that weve had a couple of seconds of think time in a couple seconds of drawing time who has an idea of how I might Um draw on my pizzas to come up with how I might split it amongst 6 people,5
teacher:How could I split these pizzas up for six people,5
teacher:How many people do I have in all;student:Ok,5
teacher:How about person 3;student:person four is purple,5
teacher:And you had a four pizzas How many pieces Could we split each pizza up into,5
teacher:inauidble person gets equal,5
teacher:inauidble  what was your idea,5
teacher:Oh how many pieces should I cut each pizza into;student:So to the way to make your pizzas  like cut into inaudible ways like cutting it 2 ways  its like  to do like that or like that,5
teacher:Okay so we have two if we split it into two pieces each How many pieces do I have in all;student:So youre trying to get two so just like that,5
teacher:Yes or no,5
teacher:in the chat Yes or no,5
teacher:Okay so Pedro Tani Hager how many pieces would you splitWell what Idea do you have,5
teacher:How many pieces should I cut that pizza into,5
teacher:How many pieces should I cut it into,5
teacher:And so then Im Lucci how many are they each getting in all,5
teacher:Whats the number of peices,5
teacher:In this case what the denominator be,5
teacher:How many pieces,5
teacher:No So I am 852 divided by four is;student:No,5
teacher:Okay how did you and your group split these pizzas equally among two people,5
teacher:How did you How much did you and your partner both get,5
teacher:Alright so how much did each person get in all Addy;student:And then you get and then somebody gets one pizza then the other guy gets that pizza,5
teacher:Brenda what did you get,5
teacher:how many slices to do each get;student:So that while getting the exact same amount of slices,5
teacher:So what I hear from Brenda Brenda how many pieces were your pieces cut into,5
teacher:And also how many pieces were in this one,5
teacher:What about this one,5
teacher:How did you guys split up this one,5
teacher:Do I have another way,5
teacher:What about What about if I split all my pizzas in half,5
teacher:What if I split all my pizzas in half,5
teacher:How many of these halves would each person get,5
teacher:How many halves would each person get,5
teacher:Okay so johannah if I wanted to show pizza each person was getting what would my denominator of my fraction be;student:So one side for the other person one set for the other,5
teacher:So then how much of this pizza is each person getting,5
teacher:And what was the fraction for this one piece,5
teacher:So what am I going to split my other 3 pizzas into in able to divide them equally,5
teacher:Show me on your fingers,5
teacher:How many pieces do we have in all,5
teacher:How big would the 90ths be,5
teacher:So we know that the opposite of multiplication is what,5
teacher:What is the opposite of multiplication,5
teacher:What is a factor,5
teacher:What is a factor Arcane,5
teacher:So who remembers now that we know what a multiple is,5
teacher:What can I multiply together to get two,5
teacher:What can I multiply to get two,5
teacher:Show me on your fingers,5
teacher:Something times something equals two,5
teacher:What is the only way I can get two in multiplication,5
teacher:Carmen what can I multiply together to get two,5
teacher:So then I have to think okay what are the factors of eight,5
teacher:How many pieces do we have in all in one out of two or one half,5
teacher:If I were to draw them out which one would have smaller pieces,5
teacher:Which one is going to have smaller pieces,5
teacher:Which one of these fractions six 10ths or 54 90ths has smaller pieces,5
teacher:How many pieces in all would each person get,5
teacher:Four what;student:four,5
teacher:How many pieces did each person get,5
teacher:So what was that equivalent fractions rule that we came up with last week,5
teacher:All right tell me the equivalent fractions rule Alicia,5
teacher:So Alicia can you give me an example of a fraction,5
teacher:So Arcane give me a number that I can multiply six tenths by to get an equivalent fraction,5
teacher:12 minus 12 is,5
teacher:So what would my new denominator be,5
teacher:What is the denominator,5
teacher:Is it the top number or the bottom number,5
teacher:Is it the top number or bottom number Troy,5
teacher:Okay so Darnell now knowing that the denominator is the bottom number what would the denominator of my new fraction be,5
teacher:And what would my numerator be Kyle G,5
teacher:What would my numerator be Kyle,5
teacher:All right Arcane tell me what would the numerator would be;student:I know,5
teacher:What would my new denominator be,5
teacher:That is step 2 four times three is,5
teacher:Step two is multiply four times three is,5
teacher:What is 12 divided by four friends,5
teacher:Does anybody know what the answer to a division problem is,5
teacher:What is the vocabulary word;student:I think I know,5
teacher:anybody think they know what the answer to a division problem is,5
teacher:what is it;student:I think I know,5
teacher:So what is the answer to a addition problem,5
teacher:What is the answer to an addition problem,5
teacher:What is the answer to a subtraction problem,5
teacher:difference What about a multiplication problem;student:Difference,5
teacher:Youre telling me that people know all three of those that nobody knows what the answer to a division problem is,5
teacher:Um Bruce can you tell us how you solve this problem,5
teacher:Braxton how did you do it,5
teacher:Im sorry they havent much of something are they sharing,5
teacher:So first of all what number Am I looking at,5
teacher:Whats the only other number I have,5
teacher:Lionel looking at this problem right here we have five what is this number right here,5
teacher:Okay tell me;student:I think I know,5
teacher:We have how many Brady,5
teacher:Oscar how many groups do I have;student:123,5
teacher:So if I make my 12 up into groups of two how many groups do I have Oscar,5
teacher:zero plus zero is,5
teacher:we are going to take a step back from yesterday were going to go over the basics of what is division;student:Nice I can write it big,5
teacher:What are the parts of our division equations,5
teacher:And what exactly is happening when we divide,5
teacher:Okay so what is division,5
teacher:Alright Melanie tell us what division is,5
teacher:What else do we know about division Arethra,5
teacher:So theyre sharing 655 of something because in this problem 655 divided by five we are asking how many times are what are how many groups can we put 655 into,5
teacher:Jose T what do you know about division,5
teacher:Does anyone think they know the answer to Arethras question,5
teacher:okay Mabel what do you think;student:I think,5
teacher:So our dividend shows us how many we started with so 12 12345101112 and were breaking it up into how many groups,5
teacher:Okay so the question is how many are going to be in each group,5
teacher:Now,5
teacher:And how many are in each group,5
teacher:Lets double check Brady What do we get,5
teacher:Brady what do you know about division,5
teacher:If you know a factor of eight I want you to unmute and tell me,5
teacher:So how many hundreds Am I going to draw,5
teacher:How many times Am I gonna have go ahead unmute and tell me,5
teacher:What is 8 divided by four,5
teacher:And I want to give it to four people how many can they each get,5
teacher:class what is step two after I divide,5
teacher:Now I want to multiply four times two what is four times two class,5
teacher:Step three,5
teacher:So then I say okay 8 minus 8 is,5
teacher:do stands for what,5
teacher:Monkey stands for,5
teacher:Smell stands for;student:multuply,5
teacher:Bad stands for;student:Subtract,5
teacher:How many times can I fit four into five,5
teacher:Hey so how many times can I fit Five into four evenly,5
teacher:Then my step two says to multiply so four times one is,5
teacher:If I have for one timeHow many do I have;student:one,5
teacher:four Im sorry five minus four is,5
teacher:If I have four people,5
teacher:I have eight hundreds and I am Wondering how many hundreds Can I give to each person,5
teacher:what is step one,5
teacher:step one is,5
teacher:So 12345 and how many ones Am I going to have,5
teacher:How many 100 can each person get if I have six of them,5
teacher:If theyre going to get an equal amount,5
teacher:So how many can each person get equally,5
teacher:So altogether how many hundreds did I take away,5
teacher:Okay so Im taking away five off my table and how many hundreds do I have left on my table,5
teacher:Because if I take my 10 my 100 here and I break it up into 10 How many 10s Am I getting out of 100,5
teacher:Okay so I have 600 here because of my 100 place theres a six how many 10s Am I going to have;student:And when you go one more back its the hundreds,5
teacher:How many can I give to each of my five people If I have 15 10,5
teacher:I can split my 15 up into groups of three and each person will get,5
teacher:And how many times do I have left on my table,5
teacher:how many ones can each of my people get if I have f ones,5
teacher:And how much do I have left on my table,5
teacher:So what we did was we asked okay six divided by five we asked ourselves if we have six of something six and we wanted to put it in groups of five how many groups could we make,5
teacher:Now in partial quotients we would start thinking Okay how many times can I multiply four together to get really close to 852,5
teacher:What is step one class,5
teacher:So really what Im asking you guys is 15 divided by five what is that,5
teacher:And what am I going to get,5
teacher:We talked about how do we get the number that were looking for,5
teacher:What factors do two and eight have in common Janessa,5
teacher:Which one has smaller pieces Adeline,5
teacher:Which one is bigger,5
teacher:Okay so what about this,5
teacher:Someone tell me which one is bigger which of these fractions is going to be bigger,5
teacher:Looking for hands Tracy What do you think,5
teacher:So how many pieces does that tell me is going to be in this shape,5
teacher:How man pieces in all;student:Like number,5
teacher:How many pieces are going to be in this one,5
teacher:Based on my denominator,5
teacher:Aries what are you thinking,5
teacher:Who can explain to Tracy what we just did because Jason told us his answer a minute ago and then we talked about it,5
teacher:So lets see who can explain what we just did,5
teacher:And what are the two fractions that we were comparing;student:Using greater or less than compare each fraction,5
teacher:Tell me what you think,5
teacher:Vivian tell me what you think,5
teacher:Just looking at my two pictures my eighths and my fifths which one has smaller pieces,5
teacher:Just focus on four sevenths how am I going to draw it;student:The denominator with the numerator,5
teacher:My fives or my eighths,5
teacher:So what if I have four fifths and four eighths,5
teacher:What are you thinking,5
teacher:What does someone else think,5
teacher:Which one is bigger,5
teacher:Three fifths or four fifths,5
teacher:Aries what are you thinking,5
teacher:Well how many pieces do I have in all in this circle;student:I think I agree because on the first circle put in three three things or whatever,5
teacher:How many pieces though;student:One whole,5
teacher:In all,5
teacher:Remember what does my fraction tell me,5
teacher:So which part of my fraction,5
teacher:The numerator or the denominator tells me,5
teacher:Then how many of those am I going to fill in Aries,5
teacher:Oh my goodness because they have the same what;student:Because when because if you color it if you do the same thing in the other one and color four in theres more,5
teacher:So which one is bigger,5
teacher:But what if my numerators are the same,5
teacher:Which one is going to have smaller pieces,5
teacher:And how many am I coloring in on four sevenths,5
teacher:Now in five sevenths how many pieces am I coloring in,5
teacher:Or how many pieces did I have in all,5
teacher:Who could tell me the smallest fraction,5
teacher:John what is the smallest fraction out of all three of these,5
teacher:Ooh what do you mean by that;student:Because a higher number is smaller than a lower number,5
teacher:So how do we now look at whats left over,5
teacher:Which one of these onethird or onesixth is bigger,5
teacher:Which one of these is bigger,5
teacher:Geo which ones bigger,5
teacher:The bigger the denominator;student:Because you know how you say the numerators the smallest or something or like the smallest number,5
teacher:So what goes in the middle then,5
teacher:Whats my last fraction,5
teacher:How would you order these from least to greatest,5
teacher:So which one is the biggest Donna;student:And so now we can compare which ones the biggest,5
teacher:So Diana if I have Or sorry not Diana Donna if I have three slots and Im ordering from least to greatest which one is my biggest going to go in one two or three,5
teacher:So then which one is my smallest,5
teacher:And what is my middle,5
teacher:Who think that they could tell me the smallest fraction out of all three of these,5
teacher:What if I have this instead,5
teacher:All right  what do you notice,5
teacher:How do you know that Pedro;student:so first the smallest one is oneeighth,5
teacher:How many pieces in all for five sevenths;student:Huh,5
teacher:And how many pieces am I coloring in;student:Seven,5
teacher:Okay hold on a second which ones bigger;student:Five,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:So what does this mean,5
teacher:If I say Put these four numbers in order from least to greatest,5
teacher:Which one is bigger,5
teacher:What is that going to mean,5
teacher:If I say Put these four numbers in order from least to greatest,5
teacher:Now while you write this down Im wondering if someone can tell me what the word least means or what the word greatest means,5
teacher:Tell me least to greatest,5
teacher:So then what does the greatest mean,5
teacher:What does greatest mean;student:What was it,5
teacher:If least means smallest what does greatest mean,5
teacher:How would you do this,5
teacher:So do you know what thats going to mean,5
teacher:Can I have someone else kind of share what they think,5
teacher:Which one of these is bigger than the other,5
teacher:Which one of those is greater than the other,5
teacher:So now you can figure out what factors do they have in common,5
teacher:If you find a factor they have in common I want you to raise your hand,5
teacher:What factor do you see on both lists,5
teacher:Matteo whats a factor that you see on both lists,5
teacher:So River what is six divided by two,5
teacher:How many times can I count by twos to get six,5
teacher:Two four;student:Two,5
teacher:So how many times did I count by two;student:Six,5
teacher:What about my denominator,5
teacher:What other factor could I use,5
teacher:What other factor could I use Alicia,5
teacher:Okay Alicia tell me how I would use three;student:Three,5
teacher:And what about the denominator,5
teacher:What does that tell me Im going to do Jennifer,5
teacher:What am I going to do with my eight and my 12 if they share a common factor of four,5
teacher:What about two times six,5
teacher:What can I multiply together to get 12,5
teacher:What about my factors of 12,5
teacher:If you know factor of six I want you to yell it out for me,5
teacher:What two factors do two and eight have in common;student:What do what,5
teacher:Kyle T what is my numerator going to be,5
teacher:How many times can I fit two into two,5
teacher:So my new numerator is what,5
teacher:What about our denominator,5
teacher:How many times can I fit two into eight,5
teacher:Or how many times can I count by two to get eight,5
teacher:Based on what we were just doing Jennifer what am I going to do with the four,5
teacher:Im looking for a hand or Im going to call on somebodyactually yeah lets go to Kyle T Kyle T eight divided by two,5
teacher:So to find an equivalent fraction what am I going to do,5
teacher:What am I going to do,5
teacher:How am I going to use the knowledge of using a common factor of two to create an equivalent fraction for two sixths;student:Yes,5
teacher:How many is in each group,5
teacher:Another way to think about it is if I have two marbles and Im putting them into a group of two how many groups can I make,5
teacher:How am I going to find out my denominator,5
teacher:Now the first thing that I want to think of that I want to think Okay what are my factors of six,5
teacher:So how would I do that,5
teacher:What factors do two and eight have in common,5
teacher:What are we going to do with it Jacob,5
teacher:So to find an equivalent fraction for eight 12ths what am I going to do with the four,5
teacher:And Jennifer what are you going to do with two,5
teacher:Are you going to add subtract multiply or divide it,5
teacher:Jennifer Im coming back to you for the same question Jennifer what are we going to do with it,5
teacher:So on Wednesday of this past week we talked about comparing fractions to a benchmark fraction and the benchmark fraction was what,5
teacher:What was our benchmark fraction Manny,5
teacher:What benchmark fraction did we use my friends on Wednesday;student:Okay,5
teacher:What is the fraction that we were using to compare fractions,5
teacher:What is it;student:I know,5
teacher:So now what I need to do is I need to create another number line that is the exact same size for three fifths but this time how many pieces am I going to put on my number line,5
teacher:How many pieces am I going to put on this number line;student:Two and three,5
teacher:If Im three fifths,5
teacher:Im sorry greater than or lesser than one half,5
teacher:So Ive created another number line for my three fourths but now on this number line how many pieces am I going to add,5
teacher:Well which one is bigger,5
teacher:I want you to think about which one of those is greater than the other,5
teacher:Karla what equivalent fraction do I have right here,5
teacher:So Karla what equivalent fraction did you find for five 10ths,5
teacher:And what about my denominator,5
teacher:What would my answer be Karla,5
teacher:So Jacob I know you just got here but what did we just do with the other one,5
teacher:What do we do with them,5
teacher:Gio what are we going to do with this four,5
teacher:Karla what are we going to do with the four;student:And if you have two more Now Im confused,5
teacher:So eight divided by four Karla what is eight divided by four,5
teacher:How many times can I count out four to get eight;student:Hmm,5
teacher:And what about 12 divided by four,5
teacher:What are we going to do with this four;student:What,5
teacher:So while you guys do this on your paper Jennifer what am I going to do with this five,5
teacher:Am I going to add it subtract it multiply it divide it,5
teacher:Jennifer what are we going to do,5
teacher:So what did we do instead,5
teacher:Sophia what are we going to do,5
teacher:Who knows what were going to do,5
teacher:What common factor am I using to divide,5
teacher:So what would my answer be,5
teacher:What am I going to do with it,5
teacher:Okay tell me;student:I know,5
teacher:Okay Im going to ask someone then to use Sarah strategy that she showed us earlier with the zeros trick and walk me through how am I going to solve 50 times 90;student:And they already figured out the answer because they its the same strategy they use for the 50 times nine,5
teacher:So what am i multiplying in my final rectangle,5
teacher:Drag the smiley face to the correct one,5
teacher:Jim has 400 and spends 10 every day which of those is the correct rule in slope intercept form that matches,5
teacher:Drag the star,5
teacher:Remember how does it start,5
teacher:And how does it change,5
teacher:Is it changing in the positive direction or changing in the negative direction,5
teacher:Where does his money start,5
teacher:Okay whats wrong with this one,5
teacher:All right Gabby factor pairs for for Gabby what do you know,5
teacher:Janessa can you help me out with the factor parents for five,5
teacher:Alright Janessa tell me about the factor pairs for five,5
teacher:Janessa are there any other ways I can multiply to get five,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:How much do I have,5
teacher:How much is two times five equal,5
teacher:Remember ranges ys which one of these two pieces of notation shows you where the y values exist for this graph,5
teacher:Three is not a factor pair for five or is that a factor of five,5
teacher:Which one of these two things is the range of this graph,5
teacher:So what do I do,5
teacher:Whats the coefficient of the x,5
teacher:Whats the slope,5
teacher:Whats the y intercept,5
teacher:Well what did we say on both of those previous slides,5
teacher:So we look at that we say what is the y value going up by,5
teacher:And so what do we do,5
teacher:Which one of these graphs is not a function which one fails the vertical line test,5
teacher:How do you see that in a table which of these tables is not a function,5
teacher:Anyway which one of these tables is not a function,5
teacher:which one has something happening in it,5
teacher:So all were learning here is what does this mean,5
teacher:What does this little f of two mean,5
teacher:And whats the X that goes with it,5
teacher:So how do you answer that from a picture,5
teacher:Tell me what the Y that goes with it is,5
teacher:What does range mean,5
teacher:Rachel tell me what is the other or what are other factor pairs for 10,5
teacher:What about 11,5
teacher:15 factor pairs for 15 Harper,5
teacher:Anyone else have another one,5
teacher:What about 2;student:Its only the odd numbers that are prime numbers,5
teacher:What is a composite number,5
teacher:Can anyone else think of another composite number,5
teacher:Okay tell me;student:I can think of a composite number,5
teacher:Are there any other factor pairs for 25,5
teacher:Okay so now that we know what this is I want you to type the answer in the chat,5
teacher:So a number that has more than two factors is called a,5
teacher:Alright what about number two,5
teacher:What kind of numbers that,5
teacher:What kind of number has exactly two factors one in itself,5
teacher:A number that has exactly two factors one and itself is called a blank number,5
teacher:So Angela what is a number that has exactly two factors one of them itself,5
teacher:The second question the one that weve talked been talking about now for four minutes;student:The second question or the first one,5
teacher:And while others do that what about the last one,5
teacher:Anyone else have another one,5
teacher:You can just unmute and tell me,5
teacher:Can anyone think of another prime number that only has one or two factors one in itself,5
teacher:What are the factors that prime numbers have only,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:Lauren can you unmute And can you tell me the one that you typed in the chat,5
teacher:What do you notice about the factors of two,5
teacher:What do you notice are the factors of two five And 11,5
teacher:What do you notice about the factor pairs or the factors of these three numbers and I have outlined in blue,5
teacher:Okay Gabby what is the pattern,5
teacher:And the composite numbers are 4 10 and 15 What does that tell me about what prime means and what composite means,5
teacher:So we just look at there and say What is the number thats right next to the x,5
teacher:River What did you guys talk about in your group,5
teacher:What have you and your group talk about,5
teacher:But what do they have one of,5
teacher:Kurt what do you think,5
teacher:What are those two factors,5
teacher:Tell me what they are,5
teacher:Tell me what they are,5
teacher:Okay so Gabby tell me what they are,5
teacher:River go ahead and unmute and tell us what you talked about in your group,5
teacher:Whats the y intercept,5
teacher:Whats the slope,5
teacher:And I say to solve for n,5
teacher:What do you know about those two angles;student:What,5
teacher:50 what;student:50,5
teacher:If you look at What kind of a triangle is it,5
teacher:Yes but tell me how you find the median;student:Zero,5
teacher:Where would the middle number 300;student:Yes and then I,5
teacher:How many numbers did you have in your list if you listed them all out;student:I think its T because the C and B are like the same thing,5
teacher:How many numbers did you have,5
teacher:Where would the middle number be halfway from there to 600,5
teacher:The 300th number would be,5
teacher:Where does the 300th number appear in there,5
teacher:How many students are in this sample;student:Too easy,5
teacher:In a list of 600 numbers where is the middle number going to be,5
teacher:Tangent of theta which of those six things are equivalent to it,5
teacher:Where is that guy,5
teacher:What dot is that,5
teacher:What do you know about those two,5
teacher:The keyword right there is;student:I just need to find these two angles,5
teacher:What is the thing that makes it the are versus are not,5
teacher:If we call this angle one and angle two you would say that angle one and angle two are what,5
teacher:When I say same sine Im saying to you same what,5
teacher:These two dots represent the identity sine of beta is equal to the sign of what,5
teacher:Where would the same cosine for this purple dot be,5
teacher:Where are the sine for that green dot be;student:Yes,5
teacher:Wheres the same tangent;student:Yes,5
teacher:Where;student:The same side,5
teacher:What happens to my dot in the blue zone,5
teacher:What dot is two   minus theta,5
teacher:What happens to my daughter in the red zone and then in the green zone,5
teacher:How about this one,5
teacher:What about this,5
teacher:What the sine of 30 degrees,5
teacher:Whats the Y coordinates of 30 degrees,5
teacher:Do you remember what the meaning was,5
teacher:Do you know what it means,5
teacher:Do you know what it means;student:Ive heard the word,5
teacher:Does cosine that equal cosine of pie minus theta,5
teacher:to determine if a number is prime or composite list all of its What Jacob,5
teacher:Where is negative theta,5
teacher:Where is that what dot,5
teacher:Whats the period of cotangent,5
teacher:The range what does cotangent do,5
teacher:Whats the period of cotangent,5
teacher:Whats the period of sine of 2X,5
teacher:It takes how long on the X axis to repeat itself,5
teacher:There are whats the range of sine of 2X,5
teacher:What is the period of cosecant,5
teacher:How long does it take for it to repeat an up move down move,5
teacher:What are the domain restrictions,5
teacher:The basics of the graphs will be something like which is this a a graph of,5
teacher:Can you find out what the x is,5
teacher:What do we do,5
teacher:What happens when you have variables on both sides,5
teacher:No whats 30 divided by three;student:Isnt it 10,5
teacher:What happens if its all variables,5
teacher:What is the range of cotangent,5
teacher:How long does it take tangent to repeat itself,5
teacher:What about the period,5
teacher:Whats the range of tangent,5
teacher:The questions we didnt get to because we were kind of rushing was where is it not a defined,5
teacher:What are the theta values in which cosecant is not defined,5
teacher:Yes so zero and then what;student:The vertical asset,5
teacher:and then,5
teacher:The next one would be what,5
teacher:What is the range of sine,5
teacher:No the range of sine;student:All of it,5
teacher:What about  2  theta,5
teacher:What is the range of cosecant,5
teacher:How long does it take for the sine wave to repeat itself,5
teacher:How long does it take for the cosecant to repeat itself,5
teacher:Where are the domain restrictions,5
teacher:Where was that,5
teacher:Wheres the next one going to happen,5
teacher:How far is it from  2 to 3  over two,5
teacher:What about the range,5
teacher:All right and then whats the period,5
teacher:The next step Alexander is what,5
teacher:And then what would eight look like in expanded form,5
teacher:Now that I have my horns whats my next step,5
teacher:Can you tell me more about that,5
teacher:Then what Evie;student:You take away inaudibleand put on your answer,5
teacher:Is there another way I could do that;student:Count by five four times,5
teacher:So Kaden what is 25 Four times,5
teacher:Does anybody know a piece of money that equals 25,5
teacher:So four of them equals 1 and 1 is equal to how many cents,5
teacher:So what is 250 times four,5
teacher:Well what would I need to Subtract from this to get 249 might times four,5
teacher:Does anybody know how many weeks there are in a year,5
teacher:So in 100 weeks how many pieces of candy is T going to eat,5
teacher:Okay what about eggs,5
teacher:How many eggs Am I going to eat in two years,5
teacher:All right how many cups of milk;student:Zero,5
teacher:Everybody right now wants you to figure out in two years how many eggs are you going to eat,5
teacher:How many cups of milk,5
teacher:is 250 times four a little bit easier to figure out,5
teacher:Now which of these two numbers makes more sense to estimate to make it into an easier number to work with,5
teacher:DeanAny equation,5
teacher:What do you think What equation would I use to solve how many eggs would about how many eggs would this family use,5
teacher:Four or less just ignore five or more,5
teacher:Can you give me a strategy of how Im going to solve 30 times 25,5
teacher:Okay what does everyone else think;student:yes,5
teacher:hey what does someone else think;student:30 times 25 so three times two equals six and zero times five equals zero,5
teacher:So Haven how would you solve 30 times 25,5
teacher:If anyone thinks that they have a faster way I want you to speak up,5
teacher:Well please help me out;student:Yes,5
teacher:Are you going to drink,5
teacher:So who has another way that I could try this;student:it really doesnt,5
teacher:All right so adding those up who can help me out what would 600 times 150 be;student:Now all you need to do is add them up and then that will be a final answer,5
teacher:Itll be what;student:wait you said,5
teacher:How many Eggs,5
teacher:Eggs,5
teacher:So Who can tell me how many pounds of or how many,5
teacher:How many eggs does the average American eat a year,5
teacher:So how many about how many eggs would the family have four each year,5
teacher:what are you breaking up your 25 into;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Haven how would you round 25,5
teacher:How many pieces of candy Are you going to eat,5
teacher:How many gallons of milk Are you going to drink in two years,5
teacher:All right which box should we look at Next,5
teacher:Which one should we look at next,5
teacher:How would I find what the inside of this square equals,5
teacher:Sarah can you explain how you got that;student:multiplying 50 times nine which equals 450,5
teacher:What about this one,5
teacher:What am I going to do with this square up here,5
teacher:What are these sides equal to,5
teacher:What are these sides equal to,5
teacher:Whoa okay which ones equal to 90;student:90 and 50,5
teacher:The bottom the top or the sides,5
teacher:Now what about this side;student:So that means this side has to be 90,5
teacher:Or this side,5
teacher:So what is this side equal to,5
teacher:So what is 90 times 0,5
teacher:All right what about the last one,5
teacher:And what is zero times 9;student:It equals nine because it is Technically just zero time nine,5
teacher:So what does the inside of this square equal,5
teacher:So what other sides equal nine,5
teacher:What is this side going to equal,5
teacher:share one of these with us,5
teacher:So try not to share zero try to share a number which one of these how many pieces of candy milk or eggs are you going to eat in a year,5
teacher:Hunter share with us one of your numbers,5
teacher:two what;student:two,5
teacher:You ate two or what did you do to have in a week,5
teacher:How many eggs would you eat in two years,5
teacher:Okay lets go with Kelly share with us one of yours,5
teacher:How many cups of milk Are you going to drink in two years,5
teacher:Kelly so how many eggs glasses of milk or pieces of candy would you eat in two years;student:Okay,5
teacher:What am I gonna multiply by,5
teacher:So Kelly in two years how many eggs would you eat if you eat five a week,5
teacher:So when we talk about multiplying using the area model who can tell me what the area model is,5
teacher:Or what we know about area,5
teacher:So now if I have a two by four rectangle how many squares Am I going to have in the inside of my shape,5
teacher:I know that in expanded form what is 50,5
teacher:What about this 99,5
teacher:Okay so Kelly how am I gonna figure out how many eggs you eat in two years,5
teacher:If I finish this square right here what is that area,5
teacher:How would we do that,5
teacher:So listen to the question Im asking about how many pounds of bananas might the students in our class eat in one year,5
teacher:What is 20 times six,5
teacher:Can you say that,5
teacher:Okay how do you know Laura;student:yeah 120,5
teacher:What about 50 times 5,5
teacher:50 times five Royce,5
teacher:Royce wants you to be ready for 40 times eight Okay,5
teacher:Royce 40 times,5
teacher:River 400 times six,5
teacher:Scarlett 400 times six,5
teacher:How many bags come in a carton,5
teacher:How many bags come in a carton,5
teacher:So the question that I want you to think about is how many bags come in a carton,5
teacher:Okay how would you start to solve this problem,5
teacher:You were just talking about how might you start solving this problem,5
teacher:Okay so lets my question for you is what is a strategy that we can use to solve this problem,5
teacher:Nine times six is what Margo,5
teacher:Matteo can you tell me what your answer is and how you got it,5
teacher:4 plus is nothing,5
teacher:8 plus 1;student:Nine,5
teacher:Valerie what is my next step,5
teacher:All right what is the next step,5
teacher:Angela What is the next step,5
teacher:In my math monster,5
teacher:How am I going to do 600 times eight,5
teacher:And what is six times eight,5
teacher:Anybody what is six times 8;student:Six times a is,5
teacher:What is a strategy that we can use to solve this problem,5
teacher:Now what about 20 times 8,5
teacher:So four times eight be,5
teacher:The next step is what,5
teacher:the next step is what Chase,5
teacher:Chase our next step is going to be what,5
teacher:after our arm is our,5
teacher:And zero plus zero plus two is what class,5
teacher:6 plus three;student:zero plus zero is two,5
teacher:And last but not least Matteo what is four times eight,5
teacher:Now what mathematical equation would we use To find out how many pounds of bananas the students in our class would eat,5
teacher:Um Mari and Lucas T Mari and Lucas t What do you guys talk about,5
teacher:Does anyone have another strategy they used,5
teacher:How many would that be,5
teacher:Okay so then Western you did this over and over and over again to Marcos what did you find again,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:If 60 times nine equals 540 540 divided by nine equals what,5
teacher:Can you explain more about that Kaylee;student:It surprises me,5
teacher:Kole What do you think;student:But I didnt know that like other people went through that much food,5
teacher:Haven can you unmute and tell me what you think;student:I think that it changes,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:So what does it what is meant by the average,5
teacher:So what is meant by the average amount of food per year,5
teacher:Dakota what do you think,5
teacher:Um what do you guys think,5
teacher:Okay so then what does it mean then;student:And like if theyre just not feeling like eating they dont eat,5
teacher:that on average we eat five and a half pounds of food per day,5
teacher:So about how many pounds of bananas Might the students in our class eat in one year,5
teacher:there would be so what would that be,5
teacher:How many pretzels would there be at all,5
teacher:What if there were 30 bags of pretzels in nine boxes,5
teacher:What about if there was 30,5
teacher:Mari can you share the strategy that you and Lucas t were using,5
teacher:Okay so can you explain to me what you mean by when you say um we started using basic division;student:We started doing basic division and then we got the answer of 120,5
teacher:What was the equation Mari;student:Yes we did,5
teacher:Laura Or Mari or Lucas T How did you guys find out this equation,5
teacher:how many bags come in a carton,5
teacher:So if were looking at this problem and thinking about Okay what is it asking me,5
teacher:What do I have,5
teacher:Um so what we talked about was like I we thought that we can like draw nine like cartons kind of like boxes like how you said and we talked about like how like we were just like estimating how many could be in each box,5
teacher:And what is the question,5
teacher:How many bags Are there a nine cartons,5
teacher:How many bags are in nine cartons,5
teacher:Or Can anyone think of another way to solve this,5
teacher:Marcos you did;student:I did,5
teacher:Okay Marcos can you explain to us how,5
teacher:In every single one of these boxes how many pretzels would I have,5
teacher:Okay what if I had 20 bags of pretzels in each of these,5
teacher:And I know that there are how many bags in nine cartons,5
teacher:So how are we going to figure out which one of these is the smallest,5
teacher:What would be the area of this little square,5
teacher:What are you guys supposed to be talking about,5
teacher:6 x 1;student:Six,5
teacher:Whats my out going to be Royce;student:Six,5
teacher:What is 12 of 12 12 of 15 12 of 40,5
teacher:12 of 12 12 of 15 and did you figure that out on your own,5
teacher:Whatd you get for the first one Clay,5
teacher:Okay who can expand and tell us a different way to solve these;student:12 of 40 would be 20 because 202040,5
teacher:Okay so what do you mean goes into;student:Six times so that would be the answer but because its an even number about four two goes into 15 that will be 712,5
teacher:Another way Franc,5
teacher:What is 12 3,5
teacher:What is 4x2,5
teacher:How do you think I did that,5
teacher:Yes so whats 12 3,5
teacher:12 3 is;student:Thanks,5
teacher:4x2 is;student:12  is 4,5
teacher:15 3 is,5
teacher:5 x what  30;student:30,5
teacher:Five and 5x2 is;student:Five,5
teacher:5 x what  30,5
teacher:3 x 1;student:What,5
teacher:Sorry 5 x what  10;student:Five,5
teacher:2 x 1 is;student:Two,5
teacher:5 x what  10,5
teacher:3 x 2;student:Two,5
teacher:5 x what  25;student:Six,5
teacher:5 x 3 is;student:Five,5
teacher:5 x what equals 15,5
teacher:3 x 3;student:Three,5
teacher:5 x what  30,5
teacher:6 x 3;student:Six,5
teacher:5 x what  25,5
teacher:5 x 1 is;student:Five,5
teacher:What should my out be;student:Five,5
teacher:Kaylee 5 x what  15;student:Five,5
teacher:3 x 1;student:Three,5
teacher:What should my out be;student:Three,5
teacher:Okay Kayla tell us what you did please,5
teacher:How about 12 3;student:For the first one I did 3 12,5
teacher:Okay tell me the second one;student:Yes,5
teacher:Okay so what fraction circles do you need;student:Yes,5
teacher:What was the most challenging part about finding half of a fraction,5
teacher:What was the most challenging part of that,5
teacher:Clairedon what was the most challenging part of that for you,5
teacher:What part of a whole fruit bar will Larry give to his brother,5
teacher:So if my paper is an entire fruit bar what does it represent now,5
teacher:Half of that fruit bar so Larry has half of this fruit bar what part of the half fruit bar are we trying to find;student:A half,5
teacher:Now you are going to fold your sheet in half which is now,5
teacher:What does this represent,5
teacher:What is it really;student:14,5
teacher:12 of a;student:12,5
teacher:Which means Larry gave his brother;student:12,5
teacher:What did my whole sheet of paper represent,5
teacher:My whole sheet was what type of,5
teacher:Then I folded it because Larry only had,5
teacher:Okay so I want Kurt to explain what her thinking is and then Im going to have Judy explain his,5
teacher:Right so now shes telling you to do 16x2 which comes out to be what;student:1615x2 is 7 two you multiply,5
teacher:16 with what leftover,5
teacher:Which is what,5
teacher:Okay and then what did you do in the last one sweetie;student:3x515 and then I did 5x210,5
teacher:No but whats closest to it;student:No,5
teacher:10 how many are left,5
teacher:What did you get and how many fifths left,5
teacher:What did we learn from our mistakes,5
teacher:Rebecca go ahead and explain what you did just the first one,5
teacher:All I want is the first one sweetie,5
teacher:5 x what  2,5
teacher:Where did the 45 come from,5
teacher:Whered your 25 come from;student:Then I saw that I still had that one you left for it and then put 15 forward and then I saw I needed to multiply it by two so I multiplied it by two and I got 1225,5
teacher:How do you prove that,5
teacher:Show me the other process that you used,5
teacher:Show us how you multiply 2x15;student:Two times,5
teacher:When I multiply those straight Missy across just what do I have,5
teacher:So how am I solving it;student:81 5,5
teacher:So which is;student:You do 81 5,5
teacher:25 of 31 and explain what you did,5
teacher:Here was the step that Franc didnt take it to was Then I have to do 2   1 is;student:Two,5
teacher:What part of the fraction is that,5
teacher:Clay called it the what was this,5
teacher:but how many did I borrow from that;student:Two,5
teacher:A whole sixsixths so what do I need to do now;student:A whole,5
teacher:If I add sixsixths to twosixths how many sixths,5
teacher:Whats my answer;student:Yes,5
teacher:Whats 10 minus five;student:Because we minus,5
teacher:No whats the first thing I need to do here looking at this problem;student:No I add to the four,5
teacher:Six and six what times three equals six,5
teacher:One times two is,5
teacher:Two times what equals six,5
teacher:One times three equals,5
teacher:How easy is that problem to solve,5
teacher:Tell me how am I going to solve it,5
teacher:How many did I borrow one whole of what How many wholes did I borrow,5
teacher:Now because I did that what is my new problem,5
teacher:Two and eightsixths whats eight minus three,5
teacher:Okay my three becomes a;student:Three,5
teacher:Where am I borrowing from,5
teacher:Very good okay what do I need to do;student:Whats six minus two,5
teacher:Okay not I have three and twosixths minus one;student:Three,5
teacher:So what are you going to do;student:I did 26 and then 36,5
teacher:Dwayne what do you think you need to do now,5
teacher:What would be the next step,5
teacher:How do I get those fractions so that my denominator is six;student:The next step would be,5
teacher:Nessa whats 912412;student:First of all 912412,5
teacher:Show me what you did for the first part,5
teacher:Okay so what fractions are you now subtracting,5
teacher:Whats two minus one;student:Equals five,5
teacher:If I have two how can take three away from it,5
teacher:How did you get 86,5
teacher:Explain that to me,5
teacher:What answer did you get for problem number five,5
teacher:Whats the first thing we noticed,5
teacher:Whats my common denominator,5
teacher:Three times what equal six,5
teacher:What times two equal six,5
teacher:What is this going to become now if I take a whole from that three;student:Yes,5
teacher:No Larry only had;student:No it was a 14,5
teacher:Howd you come up with one and a half,5
teacher:How did you get a half,5
teacher:What did you have to do with those denominators,5
teacher:What did you have to make them,5
teacher:Then what did you have to do,5
teacher:Well you;student:Then we had to solve the problem,5
teacher:Which is called;student:The top number from the,5
teacher:We couldnt subtract the fractions because the top numerator was,5
teacher:Than the;student:Small,5
teacher:Then I had to exchange it for a,5
teacher:Then I had to take my whole and add it to the,5
teacher:What do I notice when I look at that rule first of all,5
teacher:What can I look at to help me discover what is my out what do I notice,5
teacher:Joshua Im gonna ask you what did you notice,5
teacher:Are they only going up by fives or are they going up by more,5
teacher:Now Franc share what you noticed,5
teacher:Where does that six come from;student:If you divide the in 10 by five then you re going to get two,5
teacher:What did you have to convert sweetie;student:said it was difficult to solve the problem because you have to convert because you cant do like,5
teacher:The difficulty in solving problem number four on page 164 What did you guys talk about Kurt,5
teacher:What did you get,5
teacher:What did you get;student:I got the,5
teacher:Three times what equals five,5
teacher:I mean three times what equals 15,5
teacher:What times three equals four,5
teacher:How can four be my common denominator because three times nothing equals four,5
teacher:Whatd you get,5
teacher:If I write out by factors  What is my common denominator,5
teacher:Two times what equals six,5
teacher:What question should you have asked when he came up with the half,5
teacher:Two times what equals six,5
teacher:If I borrow one whole from here how many do I borrow,5
teacher:If I borrowed sixsixths how many am I adding to that two,5
teacher:Which makes it a,5
teacher:What is my answer,5
teacher:Then once youve talked about that Have you guys done that,5
teacher:Austin what did you get,5
teacher:All right continue explaining because you are incorrect;student:I got I think thats,5
teacher:Three times what equals six,5
teacher:Bruce what are you saying;student:Then how you notice that theres 12  so those 34 then times,5
teacher:So a half of the half is a;student:He gave him 14 of the bar so he has 34 left,5
teacher:So Ava has half of a veggie pizza so what is this Clay,5
teacher:What is that person doing Kayla,5
teacher:If I look at this what is this drawing telling me,5
teacher:What is this drawing telling me,5
teacher:Clay what are they telling me,5
teacher:What is this drawing telling me;student:Theyre telling you,5
teacher:What did your table group talk about Franc;student:Yes,5
teacher:Whats the word for fractions,5
teacher:What number am I,5
teacher:All right so whats our number,5
teacher:What number am I,5
teacher:Where is the 1000th place,5
teacher:Where is the 10th place,5
teacher:Where is the 10th place,5
teacher:Where is the 100th place,5
teacher:Okay whats the number everybody,5
teacher:If you have an interpreter what is that person doing,5
teacher:Kailey what are you doing,5
teacher:Can you explain the next one or you want Breanna to,5
teacher:What did you need to explain first,5
teacher:What would they be of six,5
teacher:It is one divided by five because five divided by one would be,5
teacher:What is a division rule that would produce the same outnumbers as times 13,5
teacher:Give me a division,5
teacher:How would I write it if Im doing times 13,5
teacher:What could this be written as,5
teacher:Would it be 13 or would it be what;student:15,5
teacher:What did you do here and here,5
teacher:What did they change this 15 from,5
teacher:They made it a whole number so what would this one be;student:Five,5
teacher:How did you come up with that,5
teacher:Could you please explain that to me again,5
teacher:Im going to ask you to come and explain that,5
teacher:Explain your thinking,5
teacher:What did you need to explain first,5
teacher:Now explain the next one,5
teacher:Wheres your third that you colored in,5
teacher:Now what are 25 Laura,5
teacher:How many squares do you have total,5
teacher:How do you know they took 312;student:312,5
teacher:So what is this box worth;student:Because,5
teacher:What size is it,5
teacher:Now how much of the whole casserole did group B get,5
teacher:How much did group A take,5
teacher:So if I wrote that in a number sentence How would I write it,5
teacher:412 x 212 or of 212;student:Yes,5
teacher:If I cover this up how many pieces did group B take,5
teacher:Three what;student:Three,5
teacher:Im only showing you part of it what am I showing you right there;student:34,5
teacher:If I said 34 of How many pieces do I have here;student:34,5
teacher:Of,5
teacher:Do the math here so how do you multiply fractions,5
teacher:Whats your denominator now;student:You multiply the denominator of the casserole,5
teacher:Youre going to be able to explain how 25 and 615 are equivalent using the multiplication rule and what are they doing,5
teacher:Okay so how much do you think they took,5
teacher:So the first thing were going to look at is how much of the whole casserole did group B get,5
teacher:Because what enhances our learning,5
teacher:Where else can I put it if it says add to it Charlotte;student:It said add to,5
teacher:How many are colored twice,5
teacher:How many squares do you have total,5
teacher:How many squares do you have colored twice Buddy,5
teacher:How many,5
teacher:How many total squares do you have,5
teacher:If there are five here and five here how any are there,5
teacher:See how I did that,5
teacher:What would that be called,5
teacher:How many of those totals were colored in dark,5
teacher:How many have both those colors,5
teacher:What is that one;student:One out of,5
teacher:All right how are we doing;student:Yes,5
teacher:Go ahead and discuss with a partner your answer,5
teacher:How many total squares do I have Miriam,5
teacher:Miriam how many of those total squares have both the black and the purple,5
teacher:How much of the whole casserole did group B take,5
teacher:How did you go from 15 to fifths,5
teacher:What would the in be;student:Because if you make 15 to 18 then it would give 16 of,5
teacher:Lisa what do you think,5
teacher:Would my in and outnumbers still on both instances be the same or would they be different,5
teacher:What are you doing friends,5
teacher:How am I folding the paper,5
teacher:Kayla how many of these squares that Ive colored in of my half am I going to color in now,5
teacher:What did she eat,5
teacher:How much of a whole pizza did she eat,5
teacher:What is the fraction of the whole that I am working with,5
teacher:How much of that half did he share with his brother,5
teacher:How much of the whole pizza did she take,5
teacher:How much did she eat,5
teacher:In this first one what am I going to fold this paper into,5
teacher:What am I folding the paper into what does it tell me to do first,5
teacher:In my book what would I do here,5
teacher:Okay now what am I folding the paper into;student:Yes,5
teacher:What does my paper now represent,5
teacher:No whats the answer;student:a half,5
teacher:What did you do friends,5
teacher:You said I would draw a line here and here what am I folding the paper into,5
teacher:What would I fold it into,5
teacher:What would I fold it into,5
teacher:What is this,5
teacher:So what are we going to do,5
teacher:What am I going to do Kaylee,5
teacher:Kaylee what am I going to do to represent what part of the pizza Ava has,5
teacher:Okay wait Asher what am I representing with my paper,5
teacher:12 of what;student:12,5
teacher:Who has the half of the pizza;student:12 of the veggie pizza,5
teacher:How many total pieces do I have;student:Because its,5
teacher:So Ava has 12 of a veggie pizza how am I going to model that she eats 23 of that pizza,5
teacher:What am I folding it into,5
teacher:How are you folding it,5
teacher:What fraction of the pizza does she eat;student:You cant fold it like that,5
teacher:So how do I divide that into thirds,5
teacher:What would I do,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:So how many folds,5
teacher:How am I going to model,5
teacher:What did you do here,5
teacher:How many of them did I use;student:Seven,5
teacher:Now what do I have to split it into,5
teacher:What did I do wrong,5
teacher:What did I do,5
teacher:Please tell me what strategy or strategies you guys used to solve problem number one;student:Yes,5
teacher:What answers did you get all the way down,5
teacher:Okay because you did 15 divided by five is;student:Three four seven and two,5
teacher:20 divided by five is;student:Three,5
teacher:35 divided by five is;student:Four,5
teacher:10 divided by five is;student:Seven,5
teacher:Paula explain the strategy you used,5
teacher:Okay so five goes into;student:Me and my partner said five goes into 15 and  to 18 and five goes into 15 three times,5
teacher:Were you dividing multiplying what were you doing,5
teacher:How many fifths does it take me to make 15,5
teacher:How many pairs are in there,5
teacher:What did you notice Kayla about both of these tables,5
teacher:What did you notice,5
teacher:What did I do,5
teacher:How many total squares do I have,5
teacher:What do you think Gabby,5
teacher:Looking at this looking at these answers is there another strategy that might be simpler,5
teacher:How many whole pieces do I have Clay,5
teacher:How many whole pieces do I have Clay;student:Two,5
teacher:How many whole pieces Clay;student:Four,5
teacher:How many squares are there Clay,5
teacher:How many of them are colored;student:Six,5
teacher:What is my fraction;student:Two,5
teacher:Where did you come up with 46,5
teacher:23 of a half Clay what do I have to the paper in first,5
teacher:What did you come up with,5
teacher:So whats the first thing you need to divide the paper into,5
teacher:What do you think is easiest to split it into,5
teacher:The first thing youre going to ask yourself is how many squares do I have,5
teacher:So how many of those 12 did I color in,5
teacher:Now I have to divide it into what,5
teacher:How many of those thirds am I going to color in,5
teacher:Why do I have 112 Becca what does that tell me I have,5
teacher:Clay whats the first thing,5
teacher:What is the only thing theyre doing here Missy,5
teacher:What else do you notice;student:4x3,5
teacher:Lisa what is the first thing that you notice about this problem,5
teacher:Equals what,5
teacher:Tell me how youre figuring this out ladies;student:You,5
teacher:Can you all explain quickly to your partner how the alignment of the decimal helped you solve problems,5
teacher:Mariah please explain to me what you and your partner discussed on how you met the success criteria today,5
teacher:Because what adds wrong,5
teacher:Because of their;student:All the numbers,5
teacher:Can you explain how that s an estimate;student:For number three I got nine tenths points,5
teacher:Clay what did you do,5
teacher:Explain to me what estimate you used and I need you all to listen,5
teacher:Okay so what do you get here;student:Because I wrote,5
teacher:How would you say that;student:For the second one I did 015,5
teacher:If I asked you to use them in place value how would you say that 15,5
teacher:What do you need to put in front of that to make it smaller;student:No,5
teacher:How many meters of cloth does she have left,5
teacher:I only want you to answer how many meters of cloth does Carolyn have left,5
teacher:Because five times eight equals,5
teacher:Alexander please come up here and share your thinking with us,5
teacher:What should your answer be,5
teacher:How many fives are in 40 Hudson,5
teacher:What happens if I add it this way Missy;student:That s not round off,5
teacher:Good look at what happens when I do this;student:Then it won t be lined up correctly and then the numbers will be all jumbled up,5
teacher:What do we do next,5
teacher:Tell me what you did,5
teacher:Explain to me what you did,5
teacher:How many wholes do I have,5
teacher:How many does it take to make a 10,5
teacher:What numbers are you,5
teacher:Where did you come up with the nine,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:No tell me what you did to guess a number;student:I did guess,5
teacher:What did you look at,5
teacher:What can you have together what did you do,5
teacher:How would you round seven and 6000 or 600,5
teacher:Could you explain to them what How do to that,5
teacher:Fivetime what equals 40 Hudson,5
teacher:Is that two or seven and 291 thousandths;student:On my number model I did 9480 thousandths minus 2291 thousandths,5
teacher:Asher would you come share your thinking please,5
teacher:Show us what you did,5
teacher:What did you realize you had done,5
teacher:If I have to write a rule for subtracting decimals what is something the rule has to contain,5
teacher:Really the bottom line of this lesson is today that in order to subtract decimals you got to make sure that when you align them if they did not put a number in that place value as Kayla said you attach a;student:one number has more place values than the first one,5
teacher:The only thing we had to do with that strategy is we had to make sure we incorporated a,5
teacher:What did you just explain;student:Decimal,5
teacher:What did I call it,5
teacher:What did I ask you to create Dianna,5
teacher:This would just be four minus,5
teacher:No four minus;student:Five minus three,5
teacher:Would it make that a nine or that a six,5
teacher:Was it zero four or was it just 44,5
teacher:I would like to know how you got five and six,5
teacher:Id like you to explain,5
teacher:Then yes explain to him how to do three,5
teacher:What has he taken from the book though honey,5
teacher:How did you know it was a subtraction problem;student:I knew it was a subtraction problem,5
teacher:What did you do the very first time when I said thats how much material she needs,5
teacher:The first time you did this problem what did you do Hudson,5
teacher:What did you attach,5
teacher:Kayla would you come and share your estimate with Asher;student:How did you find,5
teacher:What are you talking about;student:You dont have to That means that you just leave them alone but it counts as a zero now since theres no Since you basically rounded that,5
teacher:Why is it not going to be efficient,5
teacher:How many grids would I need to do this,5
teacher:Stand up and tell us what you said,5
teacher:Missy Im going to ask you to stand up and explain please,5
teacher:How many grids am I going to need Stella;student:I think it would not it would be more than three grids because 9  7 is over 10 and you would have to cross out the two more You would have to count the extra numbers,5
teacher:15 or 14,5
teacher:If I do this how many grids am I going to need,5
teacher:What is that going to account for,5
teacher:What two numbers does that account for,5
teacher:Did you make 17 though or did you make 17 hundredths;student:We  with seven like this and we couldnt do it  we had to take one from the 10th place and then make 17 and then we did 17 minus,5
teacher:Could you read your answer to me Mariah;student:We did 17 minus 9 and got 8 and then we went to 10th place an then we did three minus two which is one and then did nine minus seven,5
teacher:Could you please explain,5
teacher:What did you two do,5
teacher:What is your response to that,5
teacher:Ashley how many grids do you think Im going to need,5
teacher:What s 6  9;student:Yes,5
teacher:Seven and nine hundredths what am I rounding it to;student:Then that s closer to five,5
teacher:56 hundredths what is that closest to,5
teacher:They had blue which is what,5
teacher:A 10 then they added the yellow too which made it a;student:A 10,5
teacher:Then they added the red to it,5
teacher:When you see this what does it mean,5
teacher:If I say voice is in;student:Well choose zero,5
teacher:What does it mean;student:Get to a zero,5
teacher:If I hit that,5
teacher:What form are these in,5
teacher:What is expanded form Kayla,5
teacher:Franc what is standard notation,5
teacher:What place are your,5
teacher:What is to the right of the decimal,5
teacher:Whats to the right of it Franc,5
teacher:Whats to the left of it,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:What would your answer be now;student:Yes,5
teacher:If Im adding I need to;student:Take away,5
teacher:If Im subtracting I need to,5
teacher:Why did you cover over,5
teacher:Where does his money start,5
teacher:Who can be my coach,5
teacher:Im going to shade in four longs and how many cubes;student:You can shade in 047,5
teacher:Now what;student:Seven cubes,5
teacher:Because Im subtracting and Im taking away Im taking away 002 which is how much of this;student:I think you should shade 002 hundredths over 047,5
teacher:How many longs;student:Just about half,5
teacher:Whats left;student:Yes,5
teacher:How many ones do I have,5
teacher:We have two longs and how many cubes left,5
teacher:My friends what is the answer to number three,5
teacher:Say it,5
teacher:Where is that on there,5
teacher:Mindy how did you do the original,5
teacher:Is it easier to use these exes for you or to color in,5
teacher:What does it tell you to do;student:Mr Strathom if I do that can we do any one of these or,5
teacher:What does it tell you to do,5
teacher:Can you show me using that what would be an easier way to solve it,5
teacher:What has he borrowed from the book,5
teacher:Youre writing it in words not in numbers and what is this,5
teacher:Mr Clay come share with us what you have please and explain what you did,5
teacher:All right now I am going to ask how could you use partial sums addition to solve 284 hundredths plus 435 hundredths,5
teacher:Roberto please explain,5
teacher:Okay Roberto explain to us over here what you are doing;student:Yes,5
teacher:Explain to us what you are doing,5
teacher:What was the very first thing you did with your problem itself;student:What I was doing was I restarted with,5
teacher:What did you line up;student:We used,5
teacher:But how did you line it up;student:The 435 hundredths and,5
teacher:What did you use as your main thing to align,5
teacher:Very good then what did you do,5
teacher:How did it make it easier;student:To make it easier,5
teacher:I would use 300 plus 200  which equals everyone,5
teacher:300 plus 200 equals,5
teacher:Wow my friend where was the 5000 coming from,5
teacher:Am I closest to 46 or am I closest five,5
teacher:I m I closest to five hundredths five and zero hundredths or am I closer to four and six hundredths,5
teacher:Tell me how;student:were doing multiplication youre doing addition,5
teacher:Explain to me how I do partial sum addition,5
teacher:Whats the difference Kellen between partial sums and personal products,5
teacher:Is it partial products;student:Partial products,5
teacher:Why is it the hundredths whats face value is the four in Franc;student:Thats so this is the ones and then that will be the hundredths it should be the hundredths so that youre pulling out,5
teacher:And what place value is the nine in Franc;student:Tens,5
teacher:To the right of the decimal how many numbers are there,5
teacher:To the right of the decimal Clay;student:Two,5
teacher:Okay how many numbers are there to the left of the decimal;student:One,5
teacher:What place values are those,5
teacher:And;student:Tens,5
teacher:And,5
teacher:Alright our second one would have been,5
teacher:What comes after that,5
teacher:What does it mean to align something,5
teacher:Okay Zoey what does it mean to be align something,5
teacher:When you play Scrabble Attie what do you have to do with the letters,5
teacher:Then in order to build up that word what do you have to do;student:You have to make a word,5
teacher:Partial sums means what am I doing with each column,5
teacher:Do you have any idea what I said,5
teacher:What in the world did you do,5
teacher:What do you notice about the problems looking at it,5
teacher:Have you taken onetenth or one whole from that because the three is a whole number,5
teacher:Where did you get that one from,5
teacher:Now to sole this what do I need to do first;student:Because three four,5
teacher:What do I have to do,5
teacher:Is two thirds closer to a half or a whole,5
teacher:Is three fifths closer to a half or a whole;student:Whole,5
teacher:What is your estimate,5
teacher:How do I figure out what my new numerator is,5
teacher:What do you think I need to do Alexandria,5
teacher:What do you think I need to do,5
teacher:Its not six times three six times what,5
teacher:Equals six times what equals 24;student:Four,5
teacher:Then what I do to the bottom I Okay whats one times four,5
teacher:Four times what equals 24,5
teacher:Three times six equals,5
teacher:What s 18 24s plus four 24s,5
teacher:What about my six,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:What do I need to do with that,5
teacher:What do you think;student:Seven,5
teacher:My estimate is that if I look at that is my answer going to be closer to six or seven,5
teacher:Can you use that strategy that I just talked to you about to do the next one,5
teacher:Talk to me about your estimation,5
teacher:I want you to talk only about your estimation,5
teacher:Could you show me the numbers please;student:I said it was,5
teacher:How did you know that;student:I said it was a little more than one,5
teacher:What strategy did you use,5
teacher:What did you do buddy,5
teacher:What one did you think is the easiest,5
teacher:This is the conceptual understanding of this is being able to look at it and know just by looking at the fraction if Im close to a half less than a half Am I close to a half or close to a whole,5
teacher:Juliana explain what you guys talked about,5
teacher:Then I have 58 68 78 88 or,5
teacher:You have to be able to conceptually be able to look at a fraction and know am I closer to a half less than a half,5
teacher:Am I closer to a whole less than a whole,5
teacher:Im going to look is that closer to a whole or half,5
teacher:What is my estimates going to be,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:The next one is seven and three,5
teacher:What one did we just do,5
teacher:Now were going to do four which is seven and two thirds two thirds plus two and three what does it say,5
teacher:What did you make it Stan,5
teacher:ShBrucely what did you make it;student:I was pointing to her,5
teacher:I need you to very quickly without solving estimate what your answers for three and five are going to be,5
teacher:Three and five,5
teacher:What do you mean by that,5
teacher:If I have 910 and 810 is 910 more than 12 or less than 12;student:We agreed on that the answer was closer to zero,5
teacher:So if I had 810 is that more than 12 or less than 12;student:More,5
teacher:So if I have 12 and 12 how do I get zero;student:Less than 12,5
teacher:If I were adding them together what would it be,5
teacher:What would your estimate be;student:If you added them together,5
teacher:How can there be one whole left when weve got fractions,5
teacher:How many circles do you need to draw here,5
teacher:Dwayne would I add those together already or would I just do the problem one drawing at a time,5
teacher:What is your top number,5
teacher:Wheres your 13,5
teacher:What did you make it honey,5
teacher:Ms Clay were you able to do the second one in your head as easily as you were able to do the first one,5
teacher:What is that called;student:Four,5
teacher:Whats the top number,5
teacher:No it does not say Oh how did you solve the problem,5
teacher:What number is that,5
teacher:Why was solving problem four on page 164 difficult;student:Thank you,5
teacher:What do you think the estimates going to be,5
teacher:What do you need to do;student:I dont,5
teacher:Okay what do I have to do then if I cant do that;student:Because,5
teacher:What can I do,5
teacher:Becca do you see the easier way to do that;student:Its less than a half so she  like about a half,5
teacher:No what do I need to do from that whole;student:You add a common denominator,5
teacher:What does it say up there,5
teacher:How did I know that was going to happen,5
teacher:Can you tell me how problems one and two are similar,5
teacher:How are they,5
teacher:the same,5
teacher:How are they different Clay,5
teacher:How come;student:Yes,5
teacher:Okay so how do I do that;student:Take some from here,5
teacher:What about 14;student:Less,5
teacher:Is it almost half or is it less than a half;student:If you thought about it 25 is kind of almost half and then 14,5
teacher:Whats an easy way to estimate that,5
teacher:Tim whats a mixed number,5
teacher:How did you solve the problem on journal page four and we gave you these sentence starters,5
teacher:Quick turn and talk at your table what is a common denominator,5
teacher:Paul what did you say a common denominator was,5
teacher:What do you mean that makes them the same;student:Its like whenever you find a kind of denominator that works for both of the fractions and that makes it easier to minus and wait subtract and add,5
teacher:What do I have to find in order to make them the same,5
teacher:Using;student:You have to find the same denominator,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:How am I doing that,5
teacher:What is that,5
teacher:What kind of a strategy might I use to make them the same;student:Like when you have two denominators and you use a strategy to find a common denominator,5
teacher:What might I find,5
teacher:Can you review the conversation that you guys had over your homework,5
teacher:What was happening,5
teacher:What were you finding,5
teacher:What do I do,5
teacher:What are you going to do with that 10 that you borrowed from this,5
teacher:Now what do I get borrowing or trading the first,5
teacher:You re 60 minus,5
teacher:What did it become,5
teacher:What did your one become if I take your one away from it,5
teacher:I have one and I ve take one away,5
teacher:Dude if I have one and I have two over here and I need to borrow the one from left how many do I have left after I borrow that one,5
teacher:Then what does this become,5
teacher:How can I make that zero nine,5
teacher:How do I make that zero a 10,5
teacher:What strategy did you use;student:Because Clay used a different strategy than the,5
teacher:Now what does that become because you borrowed one from here,5
teacher:Good  minus eight is,5
teacher:Nine minus six is,5
teacher:Three minus two is,5
teacher:Two minus one is,5
teacher:Hudson what did do you incorrectly,5
teacher:Explain to Franc what did you do incorrectly,5
teacher:What does that  in to,5
teacher:Now what are you going to do with that 10 buddy because you need to borrow from here,5
teacher:What do you need to do with that two;student:algorithm lets you know how you did it the strategy you did,5
teacher:Quick common denominators very good which is what;student:I used the Q common denominators,5
teacher:No you were multiplying what two numbers;student:Finding the denominator that both the,5
teacher:Am I going to be closer to a half m I going to be closer to one or am I going to be closer to about one and a half,5
teacher:Is it going to be closer to a half one or one and a half,5
teacher:Is it more than a half less than one or one,5
teacher:What did you decide over here,5
teacher:How close to this is it to one hole,5
teacher:How close is this to one hole,5
teacher:Now we have one,5
teacher:How close is it to one hole,5
teacher:We know right now we have how many wholes,5
teacher:What is it going to be closest to,5
teacher:You should just get these our of your desk instead of How many fifths do I have here,5
teacher:No how many fifths do I have in this problem,5
teacher:If I separated that like that what am I closest to,5
teacher:Are you estimating or solving,5
teacher:What would be an easy way to make a quick estimate,5
teacher:Whats an easier way to do it,5
teacher:Whats an easier way to do it;student:You count up fours and you keep your answer When you get to four fours you put one hole down and when you get up to holes you keep,5
teacher:How can I check that using what you have there,5
teacher:Can you tell me how I can check that to see if it comes out to the 19 fourths,5
teacher:Clay what strategy did you use,5
teacher:How;student:The strategy I used is I took the biggest denominator and tried to make the smallest denominator equal to the biggest denominator,5
teacher:Do you remember what the name of that strategy is;student:By multiplying it by a number,5
teacher:Which one,5
teacher:Did you multiply the denominator by the same numbers both of them or did you list,5
teacher:You listed what was that called;student:I listed,5
teacher:Okay so how many wholes,5
teacher:What do I do;student:Which is kind of like,5
teacher:How many wholes of four do I have in my team,5
teacher:How many do I have;student:Five six seven eight,5
teacher:How many twos come into that,5
teacher:Tell me what you did how you got this answer,5
teacher:How did you come up with three and a half,5
teacher:How did you come up with that,5
teacher:Then;student:We got seven thirds and then we just added part of the seven and made it a whole,5
teacher:How can I check that one,5
teacher:How many wholes are four,5
teacher:What are they doing to both;student:The only thing that theyre doing is 2X36 and,5
teacher:TimJudyng it or multiplying it;student:Theyre basically,5
teacher:Whats correct mathematical terminology;student:Multiplying it,5
teacher:If theres four kids how much did they each pay up this for,5
teacher:If they share the money equally how much will they get,5
teacher:But my estimate what would I estimate it at,5
teacher:wheres your decimal going to go after,5
teacher:Well how do you divide,5
teacher:How many times does 3 go into 8,5
teacher:Because what is that answer,5
teacher:3x2 is,5
teacher:How many times would it go into 8,5
teacher:Whats 3x3,5
teacher:What would it go into it,5
teacher:What is 3x2,5
teacher:Now 3 times whatthat,5
teacher:There you go and what does it equal,5
teacher:Now what do I need to do,5
teacher:Now if you wouldve done that how much did you have left,5
teacher:3 times what equals,5
teacher:What do you think Stacy,5
teacher:What do you need to do;student:Yes,5
teacher:Would you please identify where the hundredth s place is,5
teacher:If I were rounding it what number am I looking at,5
teacher:Because thats in what place value,5
teacher:Shawn how did you round this my friends,5
teacher:If they spilt the cost equally how much did each sibling pay,5
teacher:If they split the cost equally how much did each sibling pay,5
teacher:Archiel what mathematical process would you use,5
teacher:Whats an easier way to do this Archiel;student:Well  four people and thy pay 84 so I  will be 42 plus 42 plus 42 is 84,5
teacher:With one mathematical process,5
teacher:Am I going to add subtract multiply or divide,5
teacher:David explain to the class what you did,5
teacher:What do you mean you did four goes into eight twice;student:Well what I got was 2102 because I did four goes into eight twice so I,5
teacher:Where did you bring the two down;student:I brought the two down so I didnt have to add more to  over there,5
teacher:What do you need to do in order to complete your division process,5
teacher:and Im going to have Stacy show you hers,5
teacher:If I am using estimation what would be the easiest thing for me to do,5
teacher:wheres my decimal going to go,5
teacher:How much does each child get,5
teacher:Great so 600 and then 8 is;student:Thats correct,5
teacher:Whats 86,5
teacher:What could I do there,5
teacher:Whats 300x1 or 100x3,5
teacher:Whats the next thing I could do,5
teacher:Whats less than 100,5
teacher:Jyle whats 50x3,5
teacher:What do I have to do again,5
teacher:Whats 60,5
teacher:What do I have to do Jyle,5
teacher:145 is,5
teacher:What am I going to get closest to here,5
teacher:3 times what is going to get me closest to 90,5
teacher:3x6 is;student:is six,5
teacher:30x3 because what is that going to equal Jyle;student:three,5
teacher:This is not right what did I do wrong,5
teacher:Whats 40,5
teacher:What is 60,5
teacher:Whats the next thing you need to do,5
teacher:Whats 3x200,5
teacher:If I was dealing with 846 cents where would my decimal go Archiel,5
teacher:Where are you adding an eight;student:everything,5
teacher:Because if I have two left would it be,5
teacher:Then what would I do,5
teacher:What would it be,5
teacher:How did you,5
teacher:Wheres the decimal though,5
teacher:No what place value is that,5
teacher:How could they if each made 28 if they only made 8 total,5
teacher:Whats 75,5
teacher:What do you have to do with that,5
teacher:All right Addison what are you doing,5
teacher:3 times what is going to get me closest to 846,5
teacher:Whats 3x300,5
teacher:What would be the next one to drop it to,5
teacher:whats the next thing closest that Im going to use,5
teacher:How do you do,5
teacher:Okay Jyle what place value is this,5
teacher:If Im rounding it to the nearest number what am I rounding it to,5
teacher:what comes after five everyone,5
teacher:09 is closer to 10;student:We did 101,5
teacher:Times;student:I mean one,5
teacher:Its understanding that if 2 plus 2 is 4 20 plus 20 is going to be 40 and 200 plus 200 is going to be,5
teacher:What do you notice about the factors in these problems and what do you notice about the products in these problems,5
teacher:What one did you know was 308,5
teacher:What one up there did you know was 308,5
teacher:Okay so what did you notice about the factors in these problems,5
teacher:Janessa did you notice anything,5
teacher:Okay what else do you notice,5
teacher:So what is that going to tell you about the products,5
teacher:Whats going to be different about them Junior,5
teacher:Where should the decimal go,5
teacher:Okay what did you write Franc,5
teacher:Wait but what about all the other ones,5
teacher:So Franc why do you have to do this when all that you have to know is 1x8 and how many zeros are in my problem,5
teacher:Margo tell me what you did for 09  03;student:Yes,5
teacher:Kurt tell me what you did for 41  07,5
teacher:Matty tell me what you guys did for 8961 times 27,5
teacher:Which equals;student:10200,5
teacher:Martin will I have more than one group of the whole or less than the whole group,5
teacher:How many groups of six do I have,5
teacher:How many whole groups do I have versus is it more than or less than that first group,5
teacher:If the first factor is less than one what do we know about the product,5
teacher:If the first factor is greater than one everybody what do we know about the product,5
teacher:You and your partner estimate what you would do with these to know about what theyre going to equal,5
teacher:What numbers would you use to estimate looking at those to come up with a sum,5
teacher:36 is that closer to 30 or 40;student:I think it should be 1000,5
teacher:Is 128 closer to 10 or closer to 20,5
teacher:What numbers are you using to estimate,5
teacher:What number would I estimate 128 to be,5
teacher:Do I round to 10 or 20;student:Around,5
teacher:Is 13 more than closer to 10 or closer to 20,5
teacher:What did you guys around this as,5
teacher:Janessa tell me the first thing you did for 128  1853,5
teacher:Yes what was your estimate;student:Our estimate,5
teacher:Is 1853 closer to 100 or 200,5
teacher:I know but youve got but then it shouldnt have been remainder six what did I do wrong,5
teacher:Whats 4x3,5
teacher:Is it closer to four or five,5
teacher:He found onefifth of them on the beach in Florida how many shells came from Florida,5
teacher:Okay Matty come to the front of the room tell us what you got and what you did,5
teacher:How did you know,5
teacher:Closest to;student:That was my estimate then I said 410 is correct,5
teacher:We automatically know that if were multiplying something by one what does that tell us,5
teacher:If I have 25 what am I going to round up to,5
teacher:Okay so were going to make that a three and then were going to go times;student:To a three,5
teacher:Okay so whats that;student:Yes,5
teacher:What comes closest to it,5
teacher:Did I add a half or cut a half from three;student:So you have to take four because you added 12 to your 25,5
teacher:Was it easier if you did 410 x 3 or would it have been easier to do 400 x 3,5
teacher:How much money did the students in both classrooms raise altogether,5
teacher:Then if they raised 15 times as much what did they earn,5
teacher:No I want the numbers five and seventenths needs to be written and then what are you rounding it to the nearest whole,5
teacher:How would you round it to the nearest whole,5
teacher:How many shells came from Florida,5
teacher:Because 10 times what 10 times 10 equals to,5
teacher:100 divided by 10,5
teacher:Am I closer to 1 or 10,5
teacher:Okay is it closer to 1 or 04,5
teacher:Are these multiplication or are they division Franc,5
teacher:So what would I be dividing,5
teacher:Is it closer to a half or a whole,5
teacher:What do I need looking at this as a dollar,5
teacher:Its a what,5
teacher:What is half of 300 Franc,5
teacher:How many zeros do I have,5
teacher:What am I closest to with 485,5
teacher:What am I closer to one or half,5
teacher:Whats 1x5 or 5x1,5
teacher:18 am I closer to 1 or 2,5
teacher:27 am I closer to 30 or 20,5
teacher:What is 20 times 30,5
teacher:What am I closest to with 95,5
teacher:100 and at 76 am I closer to 5 or am I closer to 10,5
teacher:Addy what am I closest to with 06,5
teacher:What do I know,5
teacher:Oh talk to me about four because its five,5
teacher:Four three what is  though,5
teacher:Can you explain,5
teacher:3 x 2  6 how many zeros do you want to have after this six,5
teacher:3 x 8  24 and how many zeros do you want to have after the 24,5
teacher:I want you to turn and tell the neighbor the formula for area,5
teacher:Turn and tell the neighbor what is the formula for area,5
teacher:What is area Blake,5
teacher:What is perimeter,5
teacher:Mark whats perimeter,5
teacher:What would be the formula for perimeter,5
teacher:Do you think you know the formula for perimeter,5
teacher:What does it mean to subdivide,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:What do you think Mila,5
teacher:Everybody tell me the formula for area,5
teacher:I know what do I know,5
teacher:Anybody think something Charlotte can you come up and share what you were thinking,5
teacher:If you could go around just and around Robin share what you got and a quick how did you do it what did you get how did you do it,5
teacher:James I see that you didn t put your partition rectangle but what did you do here,5
teacher:Can I have Mason actually Mason I heard  in your group can you come up and can you share what you did and what your group talked about,5
teacher:What are we going to do first,5
teacher:What are we going to do,5
teacher:What are you going to do,5
teacher:What am I going to do next,5
teacher:What are the other two problems,5
teacher:What would be my other two problems,5
teacher:What mistake did Eli make,5
teacher:What I would do is start off with my rectangle to figure out what the right way is and then how could you help Eli,5
teacher:What mistake did he make,5
teacher:How does a partition rectangle help him,5
teacher:If I make a rectangle I m going to decompose those numbers 28 becomes what,5
teacher:37 becomes what,5
teacher:We are only looking at this one what did he do wrong,5
teacher:What would be the first step;student:They didn t look all correct,5
teacher:What do you think;student:You could just add on to this,5
teacher:Can you share what you thought the mistake was,5
teacher:Hey Louie what did you get,5
teacher:Heres what were going to do were going to go through a math conversation here and share Does anybody want to come up and share what they were thinking step by step,5
teacher:As fourth graders what do we know about the other side,5
teacher:What would be the width of the rectangle,5
teacher:What is the width,5
teacher:The length is 10 whats the width Charlotte,5
teacher:What is the width,5
teacher:So everybody add up seven,5
teacher:plus two;student:Seven,5
teacher:What is that,5
teacher:Plus three;student:Nine,5
teacher:Plus four;student:12,5
teacher:Plus 10;student:16,5
teacher:Plus six;student:26,5
teacher:Okay but what is the area;student:32,5
teacher:How do I do the area when its missing a piece or it has an extra piece,5
teacher:Turn and tell a neighbor your ideas,5
teacher:How would you find this area when its missing a piece,5
teacher:What is the length of the rectangle,5
teacher:Hillary whats the length,5
teacher:What is this compared to the shape you had on your math message,5
teacher:How did you get the 18 over here,5
teacher:Its going to be what,5
teacher:If this is 367 the other side is going to be,5
teacher:I see what strategy did you use for multiplication,5
teacher:Does anybody want to share their thinking where maybe they didnt have it at the beginning and what you were thinking and how you revised your thinking,5
teacher:What were you thinking or confused about,5
teacher:What were you thinking at the beginning how did you revise your thinking,5
teacher:I want everyone to be talking and share how you revised your thinking how did you start it and how did you revise your thinking,5
teacher:Were going to take 20 times what,5
teacher:Do I have a brave friend for a clip up whod be willing to come up and share what they were thinking at the beginning but then what they figured out after they revised their thinking and they were thinking at the end,5
teacher:What is something that maybe you could think about for next time,5
teacher:Does anybody have else have one to share where they did some revised thinking and now they feel like they understand it but maybe they didnt at the beginning,5
teacher:Does anybody else have one to share after talking with a partner hearing solutions,5
teacher:One more who thinks they get it now but maybe at the beginning they didnt,5
teacher:Why dont you just share what you were thinking at the beginning,5
teacher:What did you do at the beginning,5
teacher:How did you get the 18;student:I thought that times were 18 so I had 18,5
teacher:What did you do at the beginning,5
teacher:What is 40 x 50,5
teacher:Whats 3 x 8,5
teacher:Whats my last one,5
teacher:As we go through this I kind of like to go through them together but what might be my very first step,5
teacher:Can you list your steps and actually get an answer,5
teacher:What was your very first step,5
teacher:and I want you to share what was the very first step to solving this problem these are multistep many steps,5
teacher:Number 29 Ella what would be the very first thing,5
teacher:Look at your step number two what will be the step number two I would take,5
teacher:How about number nine,5
teacher:How did you get 200 first;student:200126,5
teacher:Thumb up if you got 74 how much change did they get back,5
teacher:If you list your steps that you take to get there youll get,5
teacher:how many 10 and 1 bills could she give them,5
teacher:what would be the least number of bills,5
teacher:Were all working on B trying figure out 74 in bills what bills is the cashier going to give them back,5
teacher:Go ahead and share with a neighbor what you got for B Share with a neighbor though it can be partner;student:Some,5
teacher:A partner pair there what did you guys get for B,5
teacher:Can you come up with your couple steps in order to solve this problem,5
teacher:How much change are they going to get back,5
teacher:How much are the train tickets,5
teacher:Oh I missed an important piece of information where are they going,5
teacher:12xwhat46,5
teacher:What would have been a better number closer to 27,5
teacher:5xwhat is closest to 27,5
teacher:Because thats what,5
teacher:How do you say these numbers in words,5
teacher:It says Smith has one 100 bill Denise has nine 10 bills Luke has a hundred 1 bills and Dawn has six 10 dollar bills and thirty 1 bills who has the most money,5
teacher:Who has the most money,5
teacher:Turn talk to a neighbor how is this different than the last time,5
teacher:James how could you prove your answer,5
teacher:What would that look like,5
teacher:Jaden what would that look like,5
teacher:David would you mind coming up and sharing what you have,5
teacher:If we about minutes and hours what might you need for conversions today,5
teacher:Whats something you might need for time,5
teacher:How many what Aria,5
teacher:How much change do they get from the cashier,5
teacher:How do you thinkyou could actually prove or show with an equation how they have the most,5
teacher:Where is it at,5
teacher:How is this different than the last time we did multiplication which was just last week,5
teacher:How is it going to be different,5
teacher:How did they get 180,5
teacher:6 times what,5
teacher:Now who has a connection with that,5
teacher:Turn and talk to your neighbor about your connection with what I just did to the other way we did it,5
teacher:What is your connection,5
teacher:What is your aha,5
teacher:Mason what do we do with the two twodigit numbers,5
teacher:What do you think Jaden,5
teacher:This is column addition making sure we add up everything correctly and have them lined up but what really is this,5
teacher:What is 4 x 20,5
teacher:Whats 30 x 30,5
teacher:Whats 30 x 8,5
teacher:What am I going to do next,5
teacher:What am I going to do next,5
teacher:What is 3 x 30,5
teacher:How did they get 560,5
teacher:Joey how did they get 2100,5
teacher:I want you to have a way to get an answer and understand this will work backwards and see oh how did they get 2100,5
teacher:How did they get 2100 right here,5
teacher:Yes instead of doing two digits by one were doing two digits by;student:Solving a twodigit number,5
teacher:I want to see who can find a vocabulary word that weve used before on this paper,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:The first one we know six times eight is,5
teacher:Okay the next one we know six times four is,5
teacher:We know nine times nine is,5
teacher:I want you to think about this what does 20 have that 34 doesnt,5
teacher:How is this different today,5
teacher:Can you try it out with two digits by two knowing one is a zero,5
teacher:How was your line down,5
teacher:Do you have any idea how to do it this way,5
teacher:Lets do it 30 x 20 and then what would you do next,5
teacher:Share your answers and see if you can come up with an explanation of actually how they do partial products,5
teacher:Can everybody share what you got,5
teacher:Can you figure out looking at the example I see 680 here,5
teacher:James would you be willing for a quick lap to come share how you did partial products,5
teacher:How would you decompose 34,5
teacher:Miss Jenn if the second factor is less than one what do we know about the product,5
teacher:If the second factor is less than one what do we know about the product,5
teacher:If the second factor is less than one what do we know about the product,5
teacher:The next one we are going to have Bruce,5
teacher:Missy 34 times 1 12,5
teacher:Is it greater than less than or equal to 34,5
teacher:When do you use multiplications,5
teacher:Rebecca when do you use multiplication,5
teacher:When do we use multiplication,5
teacher:What else do we do in math class,5
teacher:When would you use it  Tell us when you would use it;student:If you want to build something,5
teacher:Do you have another one,5
teacher:Jacob what did you guys say,5
teacher:Tell me how you would use it in cooking,5
teacher:The question is when are  the time Ive used it monthly in here or on a special day,5
teacher:Kurt when might I use multiplication,5
teacher:Becca when was the other time you came up with,5
teacher:What would be the best way to break you up,5
teacher:Nine fourths and what is nine fourths equal to;student:Nine fourths,5
teacher:How effectively are those table groups going to work,5
teacher:What would that give you real quick,5
teacher:What did you write,5
teacher:What am I multiplying it with,5
teacher:You knew that four times what equals 12,5
teacher:What do I need to do up here Gerald,5
teacher:Because what are we looking at,5
teacher:Were looking at the one whole because what was the rule we just wrote,5
teacher:So what is this number over here going to be,5
teacher:How many whole nines do you have in 10;student:four,5
teacher:If you do this what if I draw 12345678910,5
teacher:How many nines do I have in that 10,5
teacher:All right and then how many do I have left;student:Yes,5
teacher:19 and then what is 619,5
teacher:Keep in mind while were doing this what is real world to you,5
teacher:In order for it to be realworld who does it have to make sense to,5
teacher:Is it going to be greater than less than or equal to,5
teacher:Frankie three fours of three is it greater than less than or equal to three fourths,5
teacher:Did you say it was less than or greater than;student:He said three fourths,5
teacher:The first thing what this should look like is I should hear people having conversations about What can I do with those three numbers using one of these situations,5
teacher:Is there anything that we know about those numbers already,5
teacher:How can I write a number story,5
teacher:No I havent even given you the number story how can you have an answer;student:No I already know,5
teacher:He spent 23 of his allowance on a comic book how much money did he spend on comic books,5
teacher:What is the right thing that you got and what are ways that would have enhanced that,5
teacher:Hudson go ahead and talk to us about what your table group talked about,5
teacher:Rebecca what did you guys talk about,5
teacher:What did you guys figure out Becca what did you talk about,5
teacher:Can I spend 8 13;student:You have to save nine dollars,5
teacher:Marco can you explain the next step,5
teacher:So when that asking saying that he spent 23 of his nine dollars that automatically told me that I was doing what everyone,5
teacher:What does the word of mean,5
teacher:Of what does the word of mean everybody;student:Multiplying,5
teacher:What does the word of mean everybody;student:Multiplication,5
teacher:Yes we can divide but what is our objective today,5
teacher:I want you to understand that theres two processes but what is our objective today everybody,5
teacher:What are we doing Rebecca,5
teacher:What are we not doing at this,5
teacher:Okay or;student:So we saw ours we could do 568,5
teacher:Missy explain,5
teacher:Heaven help me,5
teacher:How are you going to write your number story,5
teacher:Doesnt a number story have words,5
teacher:Tell me how you would write a number story,5
teacher:How many than what youre expecting,5
teacher:I do not but what do I have there;student:You multiply them,5
teacher:What type of situation are you talking about,5
teacher:Okay so lets see what they wrote,5
teacher:What do you multiplying it by Gerald,5
teacher:Roge how do you know that;student:Seven,5
teacher:Is there a different mathematical process that I could use;student:If she wants 8 equal groups that means 7 people are going to be in each group because that will be 56 students,5
teacher:Think about the connection that I just made asking What is another mathematical process I could use,5
teacher:Asher explain to me how were going to figure this out my friend,5
teacher:What are you figuring out there;student:Yes,5
teacher:What are you figuring out there,5
teacher:To get what;student:Youre multiplying 78,5
teacher:Lengthwidth;student:Widthlength Well its like 78 like widthlength,5
teacher:Explain your process that you used,5
teacher:So the first one is 44 what would that next box be,5
teacher:So you said 3x4 so what would it be in the next box,5
teacher:So if I need it to be equivalent what happens if I multiply what am I multiplying,5
teacher:3 times 5;student:Times 5,5
teacher:7 times 5,5
teacher:Whats 7 times 5 everybody,5
teacher:Whats 3 times 5 everybody,5
teacher:So it would be five,5
teacher:What if it was written 12x5 is greater than less than or equal to five,5
teacher:What if I reverse it,5
teacher:What are you saying Mariah youre looking at me youre going what,5
teacher:What are the different ways I can write the number one,5
teacher:What are different ways I can show the number one,5
teacher:Are we working on decimals,5
teacher:What else;student:Two twos,5
teacher:Now in order to have a whole what do my numerator and denominator have to be;student:Wow,5
teacher:Missy youre explaining this to me,5
teacher:Missys going to explain this to us right now,5
teacher:Do I do three sevenths and then I do;student:Yes,5
teacher:How could I go higher;student:Yes,5
teacher:What is 3 times 4;student:Done,5
teacher:Whats 7 times 4 everybody,5
teacher:Timesing or multiplying,5
teacher:What is this thing called Missy,5
teacher:What is this thing called,5
teacher:I got my common denominator by doing it 5 times 3 equals,5
teacher:Kurt whats the first one you did to find an equivalent fraction,5
teacher:Franc whats 3 times 2,5
teacher:Whats 7 times 2,5
teacher:Explain it to me because thats what you and Josh should have been talking about,5
teacher:Whats the next one I should use,5
teacher:Now Im going do,5
teacher:Im going to do,5
teacher:Three,5
teacher:Im going to do 7 times 3 and what does that equal,5
teacher:Im going to do 3 times 3 equals,5
teacher:Whats the next thing Im going to do,5
teacher:Missy what is 7 times 4,5
teacher:Franc if I use 2 here what should I use here,5
teacher:Explain,5
teacher:Where youre talking about it,5
teacher:How do that denominator and numerator equal one whole,5
teacher:What are you doing,5
teacher:Gerogia what are you doing,5
teacher:Multiplying them by what;student:You are multiplying them,5
teacher:What numbers,5
teacher:By what number,5
teacher:A different number the same number,5
teacher:Am I multiplying the denominator and the numerator by a different number or the same number each time,5
teacher:So what is that like multiplying,5
teacher:If Im multiplying it by the same number what is it like multiplying it by,5
teacher:Say it to what,5
teacher:What would you multiply each fraction by to make 12,5
teacher:So if I look at 34 what am I going to look at the denominator to determine,5
teacher:How do I make it equal 12 Gerald,5
teacher:How do I look at the first one,5
teacher:34 and make it equal 12,5
teacher:What is it that you are doing to both numbers,5
teacher:What are you doing with that multiplication problem,5
teacher:Dianna what did you get for the very last one,5
teacher:Because I dont know how you got your number and I need you to explain it to me,5
teacher:Its helping you understand why that multiplication rule makes it less than or greater than and how by using that do I come up with those equivalent fractions,5
teacher:Now what three fractions did you write Missy for 2A,5
teacher:What three fractions did you write for 2A,5
teacher:If Im using these fractions and I want them all to be equivalent to 45 what am I doing with them,5
teacher:How am I going to find out what is equivalent,5
teacher:What am I going to do,5
teacher:What do you think MirGabby,5
teacher:How does it equal one whole though;student:It means two are  are equal one whole,5
teacher:What do you think Christoph,5
teacher:What did you get,5
teacher:How does 4x26,5
teacher:Marco ehat about number two,5
teacher:What is 4x3,5
teacher:Okay and whats 5x3,5
teacher:Where did you get 24 from,5
teacher:What did you write incorrectly,5
teacher:Missy whats the first answer that you got,5
teacher:Whats the first thing were going to do,5
teacher:Then what are we going to do,5
teacher:Match them and then what are we going to do;student:Then were going to pair them with the multiplication board and see what,5
teacher:Why is that a more efficient way to do it Marco,5
teacher:How important is it that theyd be in a line;student:Yes,5
teacher:What is the name of what we are creating;student:Very,5
teacher:How vitally important is it that my numbers be stacked;student:Up,5
teacher:What did we measure;student:We could,5
teacher:What was our smallest number that we were going to use;student:Yes,5
teacher:And this is what is the measurement that we used;student:All right,5
teacher:Oh what is that one over there;student:That is 5,5
teacher:Whats the largest value in the data stack,5
teacher:Whats the smallest;student:7 34,5
teacher:A good number to start with,5
teacher:Would I write 5 feet or 60,5
teacher:What are you thinking Carlston,5
teacher:If shes exactly 60 what would I put her at;student:We have to,5
teacher:How did I cut her in half,5
teacher:Whats going to be the most efficient way to do it,5
teacher:Is it an efficient way to write 14 24 34 44 in between each number,5
teacher:What do you think my next numbers should be;student:3 34,5
teacher:So what is my smallest number,5
teacher:The next two 28 and,5
teacher:Seven times,5
teacher:One way to think about this would be as what do you think,5
teacher:What would that be if Im measuring something,5
teacher:Then you are going to discuss at your table group what a good graph would be what would a line plot be,5
teacher:Youre going to think about what numbers would you use to create a line plot,5
teacher:What do you think Carlos,5
teacher:What would you write,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Tell me what you got Georgia;student:Im number two,5
teacher:To group number two what are you guys going to do,5
teacher:4 14 and what;student:We said were going to draw a number on and then 4 14 through 7 34,5
teacher:Well group number three what are you guys going to do,5
teacher:Table group five what did you guys do,5
teacher:Did you do 34 for each number or did you do 3 34 4 4 14 4 24 4 34 4 44;student:Yes its 3 14 all the way up to 7 34,5
teacher:Table group number six what did you do,5
teacher:Table group one person number three read to me what you guys came up with,5
teacher:What times 4 equals 10,5
teacher:Who did we measure,5
teacher:What kind of students;student:Students,5
teacher:You know that 24  1  24 will 24  18 be  or  24,5
teacher:Where are your wholes,5
teacher:Clay what did you guys talk about,5
teacher:product greater than or less than the whole number,5
teacher:Whats 63,5
teacher:How many 4s are in 18,5
teacher:Whats 44 Vicki,5
teacher:How many are left from my 18,5
teacher:Is that number greater than or less than six,5
teacher:Georgia explain,5
teacher:When we multiply a whole number by a fraction greater than one such as 623 was the product greater than or less than the whole number,5
teacher:Now youre talking about greater than when we multiply the whole number by a fraction greater than one such as 623 was the product greater than or less than the whole number,5
teacher:When we multiply a whole number by a fraction less than one we know its going to be less than when we multiply it by a fraction greater than one what do we know,5
teacher:Im looking at what 24  06 be  24 or  24,5
teacher:Roberto what do you think,5
teacher:Franc what did you do for the second one,5
teacher:Okay Ms  What do you think buddy,5
teacher:58 is;student:Yes,5
teacher:Now Gabby with that being said how can I do the bottom one to make it less than 58,5
teacher:Okay and what did we measure it in;student:We act like second grade students,5
teacher:Oscar where should you be,5
teacher:Liz you need to go down in between Clay and,5
teacher:What is your measurement,5
teacher:What is yours,5
teacher:Now what is a good number to begin with,5
teacher:How am I going to do this,5
teacher:What are we,5
teacher:How should I do it,5
teacher:What if I do 52 12 53 12 54 12 55 12 56 12 57 12;student:Yes,5
teacher:Theyre going to decide are they closer to 52 12 or 53 12,5
teacher:What you Franc;student:Well thats  some,5
teacher:What is your say,5
teacher:58 Liz whats your say,5
teacher:Gabby what did you write down for the first one,5
teacher:What type of number do I have to use Matty,5
teacher:What do I need to do;student:No,5
teacher:Mila what are you thinking about this rectilinear figure,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:Okay the next one six and,5
teacher:What is 78 closer to,5
teacher:What is 1424 closer to;student:One,5
teacher:If she cuts each pita into four how many pieces of pita bread will she have to share,5
teacher:If she cut each pita into fours how many pieces of pita bread will she have to share,5
teacher:Its asking use your fraction circle pieces to help you solve the problem how many pieces of pita bread will she have,5
teacher:Andy explain what you did,5
teacher:First of all explain what the question was asking you,5
teacher:Im asking a question here are they telling you to multiply these or are they telling you to divide that;student:For one I think  knew that the 14 there was two of them and then 18 so I did 14,5
teacher:14 x 8 what would it be instead of 14 times,5
teacher:Would it be 14 x 8 14   8 or 8   14,5
teacher:If Leo uses all three yards of string how many half yard pieces will he have,5
teacher:All right so show us what you did,5
teacher:How many halves;student:It asks how much halves he has,5
teacher:What did you do Donte,5
teacher:63 or 62;student:What I did was I made three strings and I split them in half and I counted each half and thats one two three four five six and then I have 63,5
teacher:What did you think it was;student:My thumb was down,5
teacher:Was your thumb up or down,5
teacher:Brady what did you think the answer was,5
teacher:Less than greater than equal to,5
teacher:Think about it where we got our 12 and our 34 to get our what Kelly,5
teacher:So what should you do now that youve matched them up,5
teacher:How many halves are in two tops,5
teacher:Notice that their visual model is what,5
teacher:What do you do to divide a fraction,5
teacher:Andy whats a strategy you can use to divide the fractions,5
teacher:Then show;student:You could draw a picture,5
teacher:Roge tell us what you did,5
teacher:Explain how you would use a number line,5
teacher:Go ahead explain your thinking,5
teacher:If I do this the way that my friends with the thumbs up said what is 7 x 3,5
teacher:To what;student:You can break it down to,5
teacher:What is 8 x 3 everybody;student:Not twelfths,5
teacher:Please do because Im explaining this and I showed how its less than three this way but you explain what you did;student:May I explain,5
teacher:Go over and explain the way you did it,5
teacher:Greater than less than equal to,5
teacher:In the end you are going to need to tell me what is the difference between dividing 5 by 14 and dividing 14 by 5,5
teacher:Or,5
teacher:How many pieces would you have had;student:I dont know,5
teacher:What it asked you to do is take your three yards and divide them in half so if you would have taken your three yards and divided in half how many halfpieces would you have had,5
teacher:Now if I do 20 x 12 what do I get,5
teacher:How is 40 half of 20,5
teacher:How is 40 30 half of 20,5
teacher:If I have 20 and Im cutting it in half what do I get,5
teacher:If she uses all six meters of yarn how many 13 meter pieces will Dorsey have,5
teacher:How would you check that Maggie,5
teacher:A correct number model should be one of two things and Asher if it is 6 divided by 13 how many whole pieces do I need,5
teacher:How many am I dividing each of those into,5
teacher:I have 3 6 9 12 15 what is the answer,5
teacher:What is my summary model,5
teacher:18 X 13  6 because if I do 181 X 13 I have 183 and if I divide 18 by three what do I get,5
teacher:Dorsey had how many meters of yarn and what did she break them into,5
teacher:Whats the quick common denominator,5
teacher:Whats 4 x 8,5
teacher:Whats the quick common denominator everybody,5
teacher:Whats 10 divided by 12 equal,5
teacher:Kailey how many 12 pound boxes do I have,5
teacher:Kailey how many 12 pound boxes do I have;student:Five,5
teacher:What does it equal Kailey,5
teacher:You knew that you had three here but if I divide three in half how many pieces am I going to get off each one;student:Yes,5
teacher:The question is how many 12 pound boxes of nuts can be made from 10 pounds of nuts,5
teacher:Am I dividing 12 pound or am I dividing 10 pounds into halves,5
teacher:My first number model is going to be what,5
teacher:What does that equal,5
teacher:What did it tell me to do,5
teacher:What did we want it to equal,5
teacher:If you didnt shade in those three how many pieces would you have had,5
teacher:What multiplication model am I going to use to check this,5
teacher:What multiplication number model,5
teacher:If Im using this to check it what am I going to do,5
teacher:M x 12 and what does that have as equal,5
teacher:Theo what do I need to do with those boxes;student:Yes,5
teacher:Theo how many 12 pound boxes of nuts can I make out of those 10 boxes,5
teacher:What is the number model that Im writing,5
teacher:Equals;student:I think we only have 10 boxes,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:And then what did you do after that to find two thirds of two thirds,5
teacher:All right  what do you think we should do to look at this one and figure out which is the smallest,5
teacher:Tell me how you would do it,5
teacher:How many;student:500000,5
teacher:What did I just draw in there,5
teacher:What is this called;student:Its funny,5
teacher:Anything you need to know in order to find surface area,5
teacher:When we find the radius,5
teacher:Anybody remember what the formula for circumference is,5
teacher:Two Pi R Whats another  one,5
teacher:Which one should I use to find ratings,5
teacher:How do I solve for R here,5
teacher:Divided by two what;student:Divide by two,5
teacher:Most of the surface area on the earth is what,5
teacher:Whats plugged in for R,5
teacher:Four  thirds Pi times Whats the radius in this one,5
teacher:And what should I do first in this equation;student:Six,5
teacher:What do we need to multiply here by the way to we get our final answer,5
teacher:Anybody have another guess,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:How would you check it,5
teacher:So you have seven halves equals R And what is seven halves,5
teacher:If we bring this back to geography we live in what hemisphere,5
teacher:Whats the radius of this sphere,5
teacher:What do we need to do first here,5
teacher:So four PI times  25  now,5
teacher:And what are my units for this problem,5
teacher:Just how many of these squares,5
teacher:Meters what;student:How like,5
teacher:How do you work backwards using a formula,5
teacher:What are we trying to find with this problem,5
teacher:Whats the easiest thing that we can get rid of to get closer to R,5
teacher:And what are we left with,5
teacher:What do we need to do,5
teacher:What operation do we need to do to get R by itself,5
teacher:So whats the square to 49,5
teacher:Whats the square root of four,5
teacher:If youre not popping in your answer what should you do period,5
teacher:So 288  Pi and what are my units here,5
teacher:What do we know,5
teacher:What thing do we already know about this sphere,5
teacher:So if youre thinking about that apple pie you want 38 of that apple pie or do you want 34 of the apple pie,5
teacher:And you checked your answer by,5
teacher:So Anna what are you thinking,5
teacher:Which is bigger,5
teacher:This side or this side,5
teacher:Tom tell us your convincing argument,5
teacher:When you multiply anything by one what do you get,5
teacher:Whats 2 times 1,5
teacher:Whats 5 times 1;student:Two,5
teacher:Whats 20 times 1;student:Five,5
teacher:Okay so whats 34 times 1,5
teacher:What is a situation where you might use these numbers using multiplication,5
teacher:So whats the situation,5
teacher:So have you guys thought about connecting;student:Tires I was like No way,5
teacher:Can you come up with an example using conversion,5
teacher:Whats going to be different,5
teacher:So if you start with 34 and were taking 12 of 34 compared to 34 what do you think,5
teacher:Would anybody like to share their answer and explain,5
teacher:How would you explain to me without actually figuring it out,5
teacher:Guys whats our goal in this equation,5
teacher:What are we trying to solve for it,5
teacher:Before that;student:Surface area,5
teacher:To get rid of the,5
teacher:Whats my next step,5
teacher:Divide by what,5
teacher:So how do you undo something squared,5
teacher:Hemisphere whats the hemisphere,5
teacher:How do you undo something cubed,5
teacher:Which I do first,5
teacher:What are my units,5
teacher:Does anybody have any questions before we move on to the quiz for today,5
teacher:What that means is if theres a circle in the problem what should you have in your answer,5
teacher:What is the relationship between that and 34,5
teacher:Less than greater than or equal to,5
teacher:Anybody else have a way that they thought about this,5
teacher:Someone with a calculator what are we getting,5
teacher:So the squares section how many problems do you need to do out of these three,5
teacher:So what trig function am I going to use,5
teacher:And whats the seven,5
teacher:Whats the Yintercept,5
teacher:Part C Translate number two using a translation vector three negative five Can someone here tell me what does that mean,5
teacher:What are we doing to the shape,5
teacher:How are we sliding it exactly,5
teacher:Youre taking this shape and youre like Okay where do I stop over here for 180 degrees,5
teacher:Whats our rule or rotating 180 degrees clockwise,5
teacher:So what is this rule telling us to do,5
teacher:So what happens from the green triangles to the blue triangle,5
teacher:What happened if we didnt even know what the rule was,5
teacher:The green triangle up there which axis,5
teacher:Whats your area,5
teacher:What is the base,5
teacher:Anyone have an idea,5
teacher:How can we find the height,5
teacher:All right part C what kind of triangle do we have,5
teacher:Opposite reciprocal,5
teacher:When we do opposite reciprocal what am I going to get,5
teacher:Whats the run,5
teacher:Whats my rise and my run,5
teacher:How about H,5
teacher:Whats the new point,5
teacher:Whats happening between these two points,5
teacher:For which one;student:One,5
teacher:Maybe lets start with point Whats this one,5
teacher:Whats the connection between M here and M up here,5
teacher:What about for this one,5
teacher:Where should I  for the hypotenuse,5
teacher:Whats the Y intercept of this green line,5
teacher:Those two things,5
teacher:Y equals one half X plus two,5
teacher:If I asked you to reflect C over this green line would it end up at point B,5
teacher:Are B and C reflections of each other on that line,5
teacher:What about between B and B,5
teacher:What about C and C,5
teacher:And just looking at it where is my midpoint,5
teacher:Does anyone remember how do we put that into an equation,5
teacher:Okay Alec give us your example,5
teacher:Okay what do I need to do to go to the long leg,5
teacher:What do I need to do to multiply those three,5
teacher:For which one;student:Cant you just divide by two,5
teacher:Whats the height,5
teacher:If X is four,5
teacher:4 x a squared is;student:Four square root of three,5
teacher:Whats our base now,5
teacher:Whats the entire thing,5
teacher:What Id do wrong in this problem,5
teacher:What kind of shape is this example for,5
teacher:What kind of trapezoid is it,5
teacher:And actually first of all does anybody in here Whats the area of the trapezoid,5
teacher:Whats our formula,5
teacher:Area equals,5
teacher:Does anybody have  a suggestion,5
teacher:How can we find the side of that,5
teacher:One of the sides of that right triangle,5
teacher:Whats this one going to be,5
teacher:What else do we know about this parallelogram,5
teacher:Okay what kind of shape is this,5
teacher:Which one should we use,5
teacher:What strategy do I need to use to find that last side,5
teacher:Squared to B squared,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:I want you to think back a couple of weeks to when we were talking about trigonometry  what was that word,5
teacher:I want you to really think about what info do you need,5
teacher:And then how can you find that information,5
teacher:What side is it,5
teacher:How am I going to multiply those three numbers together,5
teacher:Is it adjacent opposite hypotenuse,5
teacher:Whats the seven,5
teacher:Okay so we know opposite we know adjacent which trigonometry function am I going to use,5
teacher:What was it;student:1880,5
teacher:Before you do these problems think what information do I need,5
teacher:And then how may I get that information,5
teacher:So lets take a look at this angle 38 and compared to the 38 whats the H,5
teacher:Okay whats the 10,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:Whats happening,5
teacher:So which of these groups do you think that fits into,5
teacher:Logan what was your problem or your,5
teacher:And how will you explain this to somebody;student:Yes,5
teacher:Mia what order did you put your cards in,5
teacher:And what if I do What if I did this,5
teacher:What about that does not work,5
teacher:I want you to tell your neighbor,5
teacher:What is this called,5
teacher:What is this number called,5
teacher:And what is this number called,5
teacher:So what might your role be,5
teacher:What would your rule be,5
teacher:So can you give me an example of a situation where you could demonstrate that;student:So that you have the biggest number being split into number of parts,5
teacher:Could you maybe give an example,5
teacher:What would be an example No a real life example when you would want to have the biggest divided by the smallest,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:And if I knew that I was going to get one piece Im going to choose the one with the biggest number of pieces or the largest divisor or the smallest divisor,5
teacher:So what is a quotient,5
teacher:So how am I going to do that,5
teacher:George how did you figure it out,5
teacher:If you are going to tell a third grader how do you solve these problems with an exponent,5
teacher:What is the multiple,5
teacher:The first six multiples of eight are what Anna,5
teacher:So give me one factor pair of 36 Cooper,5
teacher:When do you have to,5
teacher:So we can add what kind of numbers;student:So we can add numbers,5
teacher:So what are we going to multiply it by,5
teacher:So what are we going to do to three eights Isaac,5
teacher:What are we going to multiply eighths by,5
teacher:What are the three strategies that I just showed you,5
teacher:So what does the two mean,5
teacher:George can you tell us what the two means,5
teacher:And what does that mean when you see the power of two,5
teacher:What does that mean Isaac,5
teacher:You guys are awesome 10 to the third is,5
teacher:8 times 10 to the 4,5
teacher:What would your rule be,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:What would you do,5
teacher:What did you get,5
teacher:And the denominator is the same as the what,5
teacher:One strategy I think you guys all talked about where Joey what was the strategy from yesterday,5
teacher:What did you do with the cards,5
teacher:How did you arrange the cards,5
teacher:How would you arrange these cards for the biggest fraction,5
teacher:Biggest numbers on top and then,5
teacher:What is another strategy to use,5
teacher:Does anybody have any other ideas,5
teacher:Okay what else can I do,5
teacher:Whats a different possibility,5
teacher:With the cards,5
teacher:What else can I do with those cards,5
teacher:Okay is there anything else I could do,5
teacher:Okay what else do you see,5
teacher:What do you see,5
teacher:So the numerator is the same as the what part of the division problem,5
teacher:How would the division be similar to the fraction creating a fraction,5
teacher:So tell me the division part,5
teacher:Is there somebody who would like to share either something that theyve heard that really made sense to them or an explanation for how the division problem is similar to the fraction,5
teacher:So her strategy tell me what your strategy was again,5
teacher:What is the name of that;student:So my strategy was to put the four down here because,5
teacher:So how are you going to set those up so you get the bigger,5
teacher:So what are some in your evidence or argument or in your rule and explaining,5
teacher:what are some words that you think you might use while youre explaining your rule,5
teacher:can you give me one,5
teacher:But what are some of those keywords that Im going to be looking for to show me that you have been paying attention in math,5
teacher:One times what,5
teacher:Or that youve been learning what youre supposed to,5
teacher:Okay um and we talked about revisions revisions to your thinking shows what,5
teacher:Once that shows up you can make revisions to things that,5
teacher:So what does justify me,5
teacher:What do you suppose justified means,5
teacher:So when youre justifying your answer what are you doing;student:I think it means to kind of justify your answer,5
teacher:What are you doing when youre justifying the answer,5
teacher:Did you guys figure out similarities,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:Any others,5
teacher:So what are the factors of 36,5
teacher:So a number that you multiply with another number to get a Whats that fancy word,5
teacher:Whats your question,5
teacher:What is this,5
teacher:What does that mean;student:three,5
teacher:What,5
teacher:What is this,5
teacher:What does the three represent,5
teacher:Can we be more specific,5
teacher:Who wants to go next,5
teacher:What does 512 represent,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:What does that answer represent,5
teacher:So how much did he eat,5
teacher:How much did he eat,5
teacher:Okay so what were your two numbers,5
teacher:So the 14 represented what,5
teacher:So what was your question,5
teacher:So whats your question,5
teacher:And then what would the question be,5
teacher:Okay how do you figure out;student:Yes so,5
teacher:Hmm what kind of problem do you think that is;student:If they have 56 nuts how many more bags will they need,5
teacher:Do you have an idea Eric,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:So can we turn most division problems into a multiplication problem,5
teacher:Okay Carson what was your area problem,5
teacher:Okay what kind of problem was that;student:So it would be 56,5
teacher:I think it probably would be,5
teacher:Okay so 14 of what;student:How many meters,5
teacher:So rugs are seven yards long and eight yards wide and what kind of problem is that,5
teacher:So area is length times width and volume would be length times width times,5
teacher:and his dad was eight times as old as his little brother how old would his dad be;student:I dont have a little brother,5
teacher:Okay so you could compare,5
teacher:What if you switched the two if you could;student:No were still figuring,5
teacher:What are some things that you  up,5
teacher:Why would you What is a situation where you would have to divide,5
teacher:So whats a situation where youre about split up eight pizzas,5
teacher:What is that,5
teacher:Okay so maybe if you What do you think Cooper;student:Because its thinking of boxes,5
teacher:What is your unit,5
teacher:What was your answer;student:Because we did,5
teacher:Whats a representation,5
teacher:What is the representation,5
teacher:What was your favorite;student:Yeah,5
teacher:What was your favorite Landon,5
teacher:Tell your partner what you learned and share your list of numbers,5
teacher:Are you doing factors or multiples,5
teacher:What are you supposed to be writing down,5
teacher:Are you factors or multiples,5
teacher:So eight times one is,5
teacher:So eight times one is;student:Oh okay,5
teacher:So what is the factor and what are the factors,5
teacher:The factors of 36,5
teacher:So all the numbers that you multiply to get,5
teacher:So who can give a good definition of a factor,5
teacher:What is a factor,5
teacher:So how much did group A eat,5
teacher:Who ate;student:How much of the chocolate bar they ate,5
teacher:What does the 518 represent,5
teacher:So what is your question,5
teacher:Oh so whats 14 times 45 if you multiply if we use our algorithm what do you get;student:We multiplied the 14 by the 45,5
teacher:So do you want the number model to be what,5
teacher:Whats 20 divided 3;student:23 times 10,5
teacher:What does the 6 and 23 mean,5
teacher:How would we fix that up,5
teacher:How about if we flip those numbers,5
teacher:So what if we had 10 apples,5
teacher:And,5
teacher:And what would we do with the fraction,5
teacher:Whats a situation where you would need 23 of 10 apples;student:You could make,5
teacher:How many Whats your question then,5
teacher:Whats the question,5
teacher:What does the 6 and 23 represent,5
teacher:23 of what;student:And group B took 23,5
teacher:So 23 of Kennedy,5
teacher:So Group a ate 13 of what,5
teacher:If we had 10 apples what do we do with the fraction so that the number model had to be this,5
teacher:So what are you saying,5
teacher:Whats the rule here between these,5
teacher:For this new point right here what are my coordinates,5
teacher:diagonals in every parallelogram,5
teacher:How do they cross each other,5
teacher:Even if theyre not even if theyre not the same,5
teacher:On a rectangle,5
teacher:So what are the other ones,5
teacher:Okay so which one was that one,5
teacher:That one,5
teacher:WHat Was that,5
teacher:For the N,5
teacher:What can we figure out for that one,5
teacher:What is this point called,5
teacher:What does every point on the Xaxis have in common,5
teacher:Whats the same for all of these points,5
teacher:What coordinate is the same,5
teacher:Okay what about the Yaxis,5
teacher:Whats the thing about all parallelograms,5
teacher:What do all the points on the Yaxis have in common,5
teacher:But what about the diagonals,5
teacher:What do we know about the diagonals on a rectangle,5
teacher:What do we think about this one,5
teacher:What does it look like,5
teacher:Someone in here what is what does it look like for this one,5
teacher:Chris what do you think,5
teacher:Someone online What do you think,5
teacher:Anybody have a guess on this one someone online,5
teacher:Anybody have any ideas for number two,5
teacher:What do we know about the diagonals of a rhombus,5
teacher:Okay what else do we know about a rhombus,5
teacher:So what does that make this angle up here,5
teacher:What does that make 3,5
teacher:What does that make 2,5
teacher:And then what do we need to do To solve for angle 4,5
teacher:triangle what makes a 180,5
teacher:Okay so yes john what do you think,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:What do all these points on the yaxis have in common,5
teacher:Okay what does it mean for something to be a rhombus,5
teacher:How do we put the last dot somewhere that makes sense,5
teacher:What kind of shape is example three,5
teacher:What do you think is going to happen with this line right here,5
teacher:How about this one,5
teacher:And then youre comparing are these parallel or not,5
teacher:Whats this one,5
teacher:Which point;student:point,5
teacher:How about the parallelogram,5
teacher:What do you think Emily,5
teacher:Which ones;student:Yes,5
teacher:Ruben what do you think,5
teacher:Whats the letter that we normally use for slope,5
teacher:So slope is M And when were on a graph how do you normally find slope,5
teacher:Anybody remember what a midpoint is,5
teacher:What does it mean for something to be a midpoint,5
teacher:Anybody know when you add up two things and divide by two,5
teacher:So what does this coordinate have to be,5
teacher:Probably K So K is on the Xaxis so what do we know about one of the coordinates;student:K,5
teacher:Okay whats our next easiest point,5
teacher:Okay so I is zero comma what,5
teacher:If opposite corners of a square are these two points then what are the other points going to be,5
teacher:Where did this go,5
teacher:Is it going to fit on this graph for number six,5
teacher:Okay what other side is length B,5
teacher:Whats the easiest point that we can figure out on this diagram,5
teacher:Whats the point we dont need to do anything for,5
teacher:For the what;student:Where they intersect,5
teacher:Anybody know what we would call this,5
teacher:Okay so now lets think about what can we use to figure out some other points,5
teacher:And how far up did we go to get to this point,5
teacher:What was the distance from here to here,5
teacher:Okay how about W,5
teacher:Hold on before we say the first one what do we know about every point on the Xaxis,5
teacher:And how far do we go sidetoside here,5
teacher:All right whats the easiest point to label on example two,5
teacher:Whats probably the next easiest point to label here,5
teacher:What did we decide every point on the Y axis has,5
teacher:Now does anybody have a name for this one,5
teacher:could be anybody online for this one,5
teacher:What do we think for the sixth one,5
teacher:How is this gonna make multiple triangles,5
teacher:If this angle has to be 110 here,5
teacher:So what am I missing here,5
teacher:So we want to figure out whats missing for us to be able to say that side angle side works for these triangles,5
teacher:What do we know about these angles here,5
teacher:does anybody see one way that we can make the system way easier to solve,5
teacher:Divided what,5
teacher:what would you divided by,5
teacher:Okay what should we do now,5
teacher:If we do this step what should we do,5
teacher:substitute or eliminate,5
teacher:What are my steps to solve for w,5
teacher:Okay whats next,5
teacher:Whats Next here people,5
teacher:Okay and then what,5
teacher:And then whats the last one,5
teacher:O matches up with what,5
teacher:L O M Whats gonna be our first letter for The other one,5
teacher:So what do we know about this side,5
teacher:Okay someone on line Whats another angle That would work,5
teacher:Angle B is congruent to angle C  whats another one,5
teacher:What does B matchup with,5
teacher:What else was I going to show for this one,5
teacher:Okay so a matches up which letter,5
teacher:B matches up with what,5
teacher:so those match up and then lastly,5
teacher:w equas what,5
teacher:A matches up with what,5
teacher:Now how do we write our reason,5
teacher:How do you write the triangles that are congruent,5
teacher:Okay somebody here How should we write up the first triangle,5
teacher:h i G Okay what is each match up with,5
teacher:What does I match up with,5
teacher:what does J match up with,5
teacher:No what does G match up with,5
teacher:Okay so A matches up E B matches up with,5
teacher:What are you really doing with those two things,5
teacher:Okay if W equals one whats V,5
teacher:What would you What would you think for the angles here,5
teacher:anybody online knows the opposite of parallel is,5
teacher:Okay so what do we think a square has,5
teacher:if were looking at these other two,5
teacher:Okay and then if these are all 90 degree angles in a square what would these be,5
teacher:WHat Would this one be,5
teacher:So someone in here What do we think for this first one,5
teacher:And Austin what do you think for the second one over here,5
teacher:Okay great someone in here What do we think for the third one,5
teacher:Maggie what do you think for number four,5
teacher:Maggie what do you think for this fourth one,5
teacher:Someone in here What do we think for this fifth one,5
teacher:Well the shape but we need to use what we what we see in the shape;student:Shape,5
teacher:What What was the thing about diagonals of a rectangle,5
teacher:What do you know about this whole line compared to this whole line,5
teacher:Theyre what,5
teacher:When two things cross at 90 degrees;student:Starts with a P,5
teacher:Does anybody know what that upside down t means,5
teacher:How do these diagonals cross each other,5
teacher:Anybody have anybody notice something else,5
teacher:Or at least like whats the first step for the angles here,5
teacher:Alright so what do we have How does that help us,5
teacher:Now what is y,5
teacher:How about z,5
teacher:But does anybody know what the special thing about a rhombus is,5
teacher:about the sides,5
teacher:angles in a rectangle what do we know about it,5
teacher:All right someone online Can you help me out with the angles,5
teacher:What What do we know about the angles in a parallelogram,5
teacher:What do we know about a rhombus,5
teacher:Okay how about for square,5
teacher:And what else,5
teacher:What else do we know for square,5
teacher:So what do we have on the diagonals in a parallelogram,5
teacher:Okay and then anybody have a guess,5
teacher:What do we know about the entire diagonals in the rectangle,5
teacher:Okay how about for the rhombus,5
teacher:So any guess,5
teacher:If you add up two things and divide it by two what are you really finding,5
teacher:Anybody remember what are the characteristics of a parallelogram,5
teacher:And what happened to my new shape,5
teacher:Whats the equation for the X axis,5
teacher:Whats that,5
teacher:So whatre the coordinates for L,5
teacher:Both coordinates for L,5
teacher:How about G,5
teacher:How about Q,5
teacher:What are the coordinates of L prime,5
teacher:What about G prime,5
teacher:What about Q prime,5
teacher:So whats the pattern that everybody notices,5
teacher:If you have these points and then you reflect it and you get these points whats happening,5
teacher:What stays the same on all the points,5
teacher:If youre starting with an X comma Y point and you reflect it over the Y axis what stays the same,5
teacher:And whats I prime,5
teacher:How many boxes is it way from the blue line,5
teacher:So just looking at these two points what happened,5
teacher:Is it X equals or Y equals,5
teacher:How do we write that with our coordinate rule,5
teacher:Anybody have a suggestion,5
teacher:What whats the strategy when you have triangles like this,5
teacher:What should you do before you like do anything else for the problem,5
teacher:Anybody online know what should we do if We have triangle like this,5
teacher:Okay C Okay so what is What is this entire side from A to C,5
teacher:What else do we need to know,5
teacher:What else is the same about these I should say,5
teacher:Ryan What else do you think is the same aout these,5
teacher:which one;student:The angle,5
teacher:What can we simplify 915ths,5
teacher:What does this vector do,5
teacher:Negative three negative one,5
teacher:What did it do to the Xs,5
teacher:So from the red to the blue can we write a rule that just goes from the red to the blue,5
teacher:How would you go from R to R prime prime,5
teacher:Whats the equation for the Y axis,5
teacher:Did the X value stay the same or change,5
teacher:What happened here,5
teacher:Did the X value stay the same or change,5
teacher:What about Y,5
teacher:Does y change at all,5
teacher:Anybody have any ideas,5
teacher:Where does this line look like Y equals X,5
teacher:If X is negative two whats Y,5
teacher:Everybody see what the pattern is there,5
teacher:Whats the slope of that line,5
teacher:Whats the Y intercept,5
teacher:What are the coordinates of S prime,5
teacher:How do those relate to these points,5
teacher:Whats H prime,5
teacher:So how do we write this rule,5
teacher:If Y equals X looks like this what do you X equals negative X is,5
teacher:What does S prime prime become,5
teacher:What are my coordinates for S prime prime,5
teacher:X and then what,5
teacher:Our rule as X comma Y becomes What would the Xs be when you write your rule,5
teacher:What about our coordinate rule,5
teacher:What does it mean to go left eight,5
teacher:Okay how about point W,5
teacher:What are the coordinates for W,5
teacher:What are the points for W prime,5
teacher:So what happened,5
teacher:Did the Xs stay the same or change,5
teacher:Did the Ys stay the same or change,5
teacher:Did the Xs stay the same or change,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:Did the Ys stay the same or change,5
teacher:X equals three is this a vertical or a horizontal line,5
teacher:What did we really do from the first one to that one,5
teacher:So where far did I slide it,5
teacher:Whats another way that we could describe it,5
teacher:How would we write the vector for this,5
teacher:Whats the vector for left eight,5
teacher:What do we think everyone,5
teacher:What does the shape kind of look like,5
teacher:WHat Do you think that third angle is up there,5
teacher:Whats this angle up here,5
teacher:What does it match up With,5
teacher:Or what else,5
teacher:What kind of angle do those two lines make when they cross the red and the green,5
teacher:Whats the product of the slopes of two perpendicular lines,5
teacher:Whats that important number from yesterday,5
teacher:When two lines are perpendicular what do they always multiply to be,5
teacher:When you have two perpendicular lines whats the product of their slopes,5
teacher:So what is a horizontal and a vertical line,5
teacher:If we look on the graph whats the midpoint,5
teacher:Whats the average of three and negative three,5
teacher:Whats right in the middle,5
teacher:Whats the average of one and one,5
teacher:What does that mean that the average of two things that are the same,5
teacher:Apolo what do you think,5
teacher:The average of one and one,5
teacher:So for the Xs whats the average of zero and zero,5
teacher:All right whats the slope of SV,5
teacher:What do you notice about the Y values,5
teacher:So the line RT whats the slope of that line,5
teacher:So whats one of the main things we know about a rhombus,5
teacher:Whats one thing,5
teacher:Also what else are the opposite sides,5
teacher:What does that give us,5
teacher:Now if its a parallelogram what should be true about this other line up here,5
teacher:Whats a negative dividShane by a negative,5
teacher:And what do we know about the diagonals of the parallelogram,5
teacher:So if were looking at this value and this value whats the average of zero and two,5
teacher:So the one thing I want to say about this trapezoid what does it mean to be a trapezoid,5
teacher:Or whats the exact middle of zero and two,5
teacher:Whats right in the middle,5
teacher:So its the average of zero and two but if we actually solve it out whats two over two,5
teacher:Slightly more tricky question whats the average of negative three and four,5
teacher:Because if I askShane whats the middle of six and 10,5
teacher:So whats the exact middle,5
teacher:Whats the exact middle of zero and one,5
teacher:Whats exactly in the middle of negative four and two,5
teacher:Whats the exact middle of zero and two,5
teacher:If I had 5 and you have 10 and we add it up and divide it by two what does that really mean,5
teacher:And then what about the other sides,5
teacher:Now what some people did as a as a answer is if two boxes is six centimeters how many centimeters is one box,5
teacher:So I want to hear what should we What should we pick for the first one,5
teacher:Which letter which three letters do anything for the first triangle,5
teacher:Could  be any order what do you think,5
teacher:whats the easiest comparison to make for number two,5
teacher:Which which two sides are the same or the easiest to compare,5
teacher:Eight over six becomes,5
teacher:What does that become,5
teacher:if we divide by two four thirds,5
teacher:What kind of triangles do we have in number three,5
teacher:what kind of triangles are these,5
teacher:what do we know about the bass angles an isosdeles triangle,5
teacher:What kind of angles Are we going to use the number four,5
teacher:Well what do we need to use;student:Are we using angles,5
teacher:What are they both,5
teacher:This is similar to triangle NM was similar to which one,5
teacher:Out of these three Which one do we have,5
teacher:Okay so what do we have,5
teacher:Starts with a V;student:Right angle,5
teacher:Whats one of the most useful types of angles in these problems,5
teacher:Now what number of actual kilometers are represented by 175 centimeters on the map,5
teacher:What was the option that didnt work,5
teacher:And that whole unit was about how do we prove two triangles congruent,5
teacher:How do we prove them Exactly the same,5
teacher:all the angles all the sides exactly the same,5
teacher:Whats that,5
teacher:Whats the last angle,5
teacher:how many centimeters,5
teacher:What about this third angle,5
teacher:What would be this last angle here,5
teacher:Well can we simplify the first one to,5
teacher:What did you divide by,5
teacher:What if you What can we divide that one by,5
teacher:Heres another way Think about it whats 10 divided by five,5
teacher:24 over 12,5
teacher:Okay number one what what extra information that we need to know here,5
teacher:And whats 180 minus 141,5
teacher:Any ideas for how we could clear this up,5
teacher:For this explanation of the rule,5
teacher:What part of that didnt get addressed,5
teacher:Stephanie if you double zero What do you get,5
teacher:What do you think that second step is going to look like,5
teacher:What do you think its going to look like,5
teacher:Compared to the first one,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Bishop What do you think,5
teacher:What do you mean greater,5
teacher:so wheres one two,5
teacher:Who would like to make a conjecture about what that sailboat gonna look like,5
teacher:What would that whats that sailboat kind of look like Richard,5
teacher:What do you think Jacob,5
teacher:What do you think Adam,5
teacher:Aden What do you think,5
teacher:How many fours go into 4,5
teacher:Okay with how much left over,5
teacher:whats zero times two,5
teacher:I want you to think how did you figure this out Eli;student:Ten yeah,5
teacher:Zero times two is what,5
teacher:What does it mean to double something,5
teacher:what benchmark is that sum closest to,5
teacher:0 one Half one one and a half or two,5
teacher:who can justify that for me,5
teacher:whats this closest to,5
teacher:seven eigths is close to what,5
teacher:And 56ths is close to;student:A whole,5
teacher:what what do we know about these fractions,5
teacher:What are they close to,5
teacher:Anybody want to tell me,5
teacher:Actually turn to a neighbor and tell them why what its closest to,5
teacher:Richard you want to explain that,5
teacher:Wheres 51,5
teacher:So wheres 51,5
teacher:Wheres 5 7,5
teacher:So double means what,5
teacher:What about this one,5
teacher:How many threes does it take to make a whole,5
teacher:Who would like to explain this one Abigail,5
teacher:What is seven fifths,5
teacher:Can you use the graph to figure out what is Noahs age when Lilith was 14 and a half using your graph,5
teacher:When Lilith was 14 and a half how old was Noah,5
teacher:Is it greater than or not greater than,5
teacher:How many times greater is it,5
teacher:So can anybody tell me how much thats going to be in relation to the original,5
teacher:Whats going to be the relationship between this value and this value,5
teacher:Can anybody tell me off the top of your head,5
teacher:Because if youre dividing by two the answers going to be;student:The answer is going to be in two groups because dividing by two youve got to split the answer into two groups,5
teacher:So you can see that this is the trapezoid and what do we know about coordinates,5
teacher:So what would the coordinate be of this point right here,5
teacher:What would the coordinates be of that point,5
teacher:Does everybody know what a rule is,5
teacher:When its the first coordinate which axis;student:Or,5
teacher:So if she doubles that side,5
teacher:So whats that going to do to all of it,5
teacher:What do you notice about the points you plotted,5
teacher:So what happened,5
teacher:So how would you describe Lilith and Noahs ages,5
teacher:So its because Lilith always what,5
teacher:And,5
teacher:Ally give me one,5
teacher:Do you guys see anything really interesting and exciting in your group,5
teacher:What do you guys think,5
teacher:Talk to Violet about what you think it should be and how its different from up there,5
teacher:What did you think they should do,5
teacher:Whats wrong with the second one,5
teacher:Now for your math warmup Id like you on your whiteboard to tell me which of the benchmarks the sum is closest to,5
teacher:Whats wrong with the second one,5
teacher:What did she do,5
teacher:Can somebody make an overall statement about how Sarah did,5
teacher:Tell me about Sarah,5
teacher:What did she do,5
teacher:What would the next one be,5
teacher:So what we said was this always has to come first and this always has to come second and whats this one,5
teacher:What do you notice about the point you plotted,5
teacher:So tell me about what you did,5
teacher:So Alec where do you think your friend is,5
teacher:Wheres your friend,5
teacher:And was there one more,5
teacher:So if wed had what are some strategies you could use to show me what half of nine would be,5
teacher:Okay so then what is the answer,5
teacher:Whats the answer,5
teacher:What is half of nine,5
teacher:Does anybody else have a strategy for showing it,5
teacher:Okay so how about a third of 12,5
teacher:What is a third of 12,5
teacher:Um How about 13,5
teacher:How did you guys do 13,5
teacher:How could you,5
teacher:Why dont you show me,5
teacher:You want to show us Rylen,5
teacher:And how many threes are in 13,5
teacher:Whats the remainder,5
teacher:Okay so what would you call that one Four and;student:One,5
teacher:So what would half of 9 be,5
teacher:So what if you just counted 1212,5
teacher:But what if you just numbered them,5
teacher:What would another strategy be for for showing half of eight,5
teacher:So how many needs to be how many zeros need to be in the quotient,5
teacher:How many zeros do you need,5
teacher:How many total zeros do you need,5
teacher:How many zeros are in the dividend,5
teacher:How many zeros are in the dividend,5
teacher:Okay so the answer should be,5
teacher:So when theres a remainder what can you say about the problem,5
teacher:Can somebody show me a picture of 13 divided by three,5
teacher:But what if you know that theres a remainder what do you know about the divisor and the dividend,5
teacher:What would half of nine be,5
teacher:So if youre picturing those if you picture those apples what would half of 9 be,5
teacher:What is half of eight,5
teacher:Whats half of eight,5
teacher:And if we are trying to figure out what half of eight is what would a strategy be,5
teacher:Who can come up and show me how they would figure out or how they would show somebody how to figure out half of eight,5
teacher:Okay does somebody have a different strategy for showing,5
teacher:What would half of 8 be,5
teacher:How would you describe that compared to the first one,5
teacher:Show us,5
teacher:Okay how about a third of 14,5
teacher:Okay so what do you think it is;student:Yes,5
teacher:And then the Where are we going,5
teacher:Okay so what is the fewest number of blocks you would walk from the library to the ice cream shop;student:I did it from the top and I got 10,5
teacher:Library to the ice cream shop,5
teacher:Okay so wheres the ice cream shop;student:The library to the ice cream shop,5
teacher:What is the distance,5
teacher:The shortest distance,5
teacher:What are the coordinates for the ice cream shop,5
teacher:Okay and what are the coordinates of the library,5
teacher:Where could your friend be,5
teacher:Okay so Anna where is one place that your friends could be,5
teacher:Okay so and you said they could be at the pizzeria,5
teacher:Where else could they be,5
teacher:Wheres the post office,5
teacher:Oh yeah you could go 123456789 Where else,5
teacher:Brielle how many blocks,5
teacher:Park entrance to the pizzeria,5
teacher:So what is the fewest number of blocks from the park entrance to the pizzeria,5
teacher:What do you see,5
teacher:Chase you want to show us or tell us,5
teacher:So if you were thinking about an apple or like if you had two apples leftover or granola bars or whatever and you knew that you had to split those into three parts what if you did this,5
teacher:What if you split those into thirds,5
teacher:So what is a fourth of three,5
teacher:So how are you going to get there,5
teacher:What is the fewest number of blocks Ben will have to walk to get to the grocery store and be prepared to explain,5
teacher:How many blocks does he have to walk,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Whats the fewest number of blocks,5
teacher:What did you guys figure out,5
teacher:Okay so come show me,5
teacher:So can somebody tell me where were starting,5
teacher:What were the coordinates of where we started,5
teacher:What are the coordinates,5
teacher:And where did we end up,5
teacher:What are the coordinates of the grocery store,5
teacher:How many blocks exactly,5
teacher:How many zeros need to be in the quotient,5
teacher:Is the first coordinate what makes it tall or is the first coordinate what makes it wide;student:Will it be,5
teacher:Its,5
teacher:Multiply what by two,5
teacher:So then what,5
teacher:So in order to make half into fifths what do we need to do to the half,5
teacher:The one half Logan,5
teacher:Whats the next step that we need to do,5
teacher:Do you know what the next step is,5
teacher:So this becomes a two and then this becomes what,5
teacher:If you were to find the quick common denominator what would you do,5
teacher:quick common denominator Anna,5
teacher:Talk to a partner about what you noticed,5
teacher:What do you notice about those two things,5
teacher:Those two charts,5
teacher:Is it gonna be more or less than what you start with,5
teacher:So what is one fifth of 15,5
teacher:When youre doing your partner are done I want you to talk about what do you notice,5
teacher:So to make thirds into sixths what do we do guys,5
teacher:Can you tell us what your strategy was for solving problem one;student:Oh wait no youre right,5
teacher:do you remember what we do to make thirds into sixths,5
teacher:What do we need to do with the fractions in order to subtract this Aiden,5
teacher:So what would your estimate be,5
teacher:What would you think,5
teacher:What strategy would you use to solve problem four,5
teacher:So for problem for Joey what would you do,5
teacher:So hes saying that the quick common denominator which we still have those strategies for finding the common denominators would be What Joey,5
teacher:quick denominator  to find that,5
teacher:Three times four equals;student:Three times four,5
teacher:Were going to multiply three fourths by what,5
teacher:We get nine twelfths and here were going to multiply one third by what,5
teacher:So what would the answer to that one be Logan,5
teacher:So what strategy would you use,5
teacher:What denominator would be used,5
teacher:So what do you need to do first in order to have Get this ready to subtract,5
teacher:A whole from three and youd make this into,5
teacher:So the first thing we need to do really is to what,5
teacher:What do we need to do,5
teacher:Any other strategies,5
teacher:So five times what equals the N number,5
teacher:Whatd you do,5
teacher:And then you just multiply straight across 13 times two is 26 and three times one is three and then 26 divided by three would be what would 26 divided by three beats,5
teacher:How many threes are in 26,5
teacher:And then how many leftover,5
teacher:And what do I do with that two,5
teacher:And what would that practically be;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Two over whats the denominator,5
teacher:Two thirds so that means there needs to be how many parts,5
teacher:So did anybody get the answer,5
teacher:Anna what did you get,5
teacher:Two thirds of two thirds is four ninths and tell me what you did to get that,5
teacher:So the first step Landon would be what;student:Yes,5
teacher:So we fold that way into thirds and we want two thirds of two thirds so what am I going to shade here,5
teacher:What am I going to shade;student:Two in thirds,5
teacher:So what is the whole,5
teacher:What is the whole;student:two thirds,5
teacher:And whats our denominator,5
teacher:Plus two thirds how many two thirds do I need here,5
teacher:How many more,5
teacher:Whats another way you can think about it,5
teacher:So so when you answered the second one how was hows that different than the second,5
teacher:What what did you notice about the two without the answers to one or two,5
teacher:How would that be true,5
teacher:So so what we did was we first found what would one for 15,5
teacher:So if one fifth is three then how many are three,5
teacher:And then you multiply that by three to get,5
teacher:Four times three,5
teacher:How would you  do an estimate Anna,5
teacher:So what would three fifths be,5
teacher:Two times three is,5
teacher:So 20 times three is;student:Six,5
teacher:Divided by five is,5
teacher:So what did you find out,5
teacher:Did you did you find anything out about how three and four are related,5
teacher:So so if you were thinking about two thirds of 13 you could think about it as what are some different ways you can think about that,5
teacher:What have we talked about,5
teacher:Twenty times three is,5
teacher:What would your estimate be,5
teacher:So then tell me about this one,5
teacher:What is different about them,5
teacher:By how much,5
teacher:Okay so who would like to share;student:Oh by three,5
teacher:What does long mean,5
teacher:How much taller;student:Yeah,5
teacher:So in this case in order to figure out what happened to your new trapezoid what did you do first,5
teacher:What would you do,5
teacher:What did you do to come up with the new trapezoid,5
teacher:So you followed the rule and what did you create,5
teacher:How did you do it,5
teacher:And what did you do,5
teacher:What was the first thing you had to do Abigail,5
teacher:What is that number,5
teacher:Just how would you if I gave you this problem how would you add that up,5
teacher:All right so who would like to come up and show how you added it up;student:I never learned that way,5
teacher:Hey now can I get you to come over and write what you did on the board,5
teacher:And whats the E coordinate,5
teacher:And then if I double the first coordinate here whats it going to be Ally,5
teacher:And if I double the first coordinate here its going to be what,5
teacher:If we double the first coordinate here its going to be what Ariana,5
teacher:So zero times two,5
teacher:So a rule so what would you say a rule is,5
teacher:Was anybody more specific about that,5
teacher:So the new trapezoid was going to be wider but wider Fletcher what did you say,5
teacher:Was anybody more specific,5
teacher:So what does it mean to be more specific,5
teacher:So what can you tell me about the new trapezoid,5
teacher:And then Savannah do you want to come and set yours up on the board,5
teacher:Did anybody have anything more specific,5
teacher:How would you say that;student:By two,5
teacher:So it is going to be wider wider by how much,5
teacher:Wider by two or whats a different way to say it that makes more sense,5
teacher:Wider by two wider How is it wider,5
teacher:Whats another way to say it,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:So how would you say that you used the new coordinates,5
teacher:Its going to be wider by how much,5
teacher:But when youre multiplying by two what do you say;student:Well yeah it would be 10 because what you divided five by is,5
teacher:So will you explain what you did here,5
teacher:We you explain what you did,5
teacher:Whats a fraction,5
teacher:So what makes them different from a mixed number,5
teacher:What makes those fractions different than a mixed number Cooper,5
teacher:Okay so can you tell me in words what the difference might be;student:Then that would be the fraction and the mixed number would be,5
teacher:How are they different,5
teacher:So you gave me example and youre absolutely right but tell me in words how would you describe the difference,5
teacher:So what What is that word that we use for the size of pieces,5
teacher:So they give you an example here of the number What is this whole thing called put together,5
teacher:What is that whole number all put together,5
teacher:So when youre finished talk to your partner about how you solved them how did you solve these problems,5
teacher:So on the first one Well first of all what were the same,5
teacher:What was the same about these two problems,5
teacher:How were they similar,5
teacher:How else,5
teacher:How are they different,5
teacher:Okay so who would like to tell me what a fraction is,5
teacher:So whats the difference between a fraction and a mixed number,5
teacher:Show me;student:Yeah,5
teacher:What is it closest to,5
teacher:Can you walk us through it,5
teacher:What does that on stand for,5
teacher:So why did what does that one mean,5
teacher:Come point to what youre talking about;student:I dont agree because the decimal,5
teacher:So this is confusing to me what I do with the five then,5
teacher:What do I do with that,5
teacher:What do I do with the five Martina,5
teacher:Four hundreds plus five hundreds equals;student:Then I added the hundreds place and I got,5
teacher:All right show me,5
teacher:How did you figure out that its 58,5
teacher:So what is this closest do,5
teacher:Zero half or 1,5
teacher:Whats it closest to,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:Is that closer to zero 12 or 1,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:Landon how did you think about that,5
teacher:How many,5
teacher:So how many need to be in the quotient,5
teacher:How many zeros do you need to have total,5
teacher:Are there any other strategies that you guys use,5
teacher:Anything else to make you think of anything else,5
teacher:Whats another way to prove it,5
teacher:Can you think of any other mixed number that would be equal to 21 fifths,5
teacher:Would there be any other mixed numbers that would be equal to 21 fifths,5
teacher:Is there a different way for you to come up with to n reflect that number,5
teacher:Is there any way you could do something with this number;student:Four is ten,5
teacher:How many fifths;student:What else do we have,5
teacher:Alright any any great ideas;student:I dont know what to do,5
teacher:Anna what were you thinking,5
teacher:is there a way you could express this as having a different whole number,5
teacher:Well if we look over here what if we just break this up differently,5
teacher:If I just wanted if I just said this is one then what improper fraction is left,5
teacher:So this could be one and how many fifths,5
teacher:Whats another way to express this as a mixed number,5
teacher:And what is that fraction,5
teacher:Can you give me one,5
teacher:First,5
teacher:And then how many are leftovers,5
teacher:So for example with two whole numbers is that number between,5
teacher:Which two whole numbers,5
teacher:Which two whole numbers is that number between,5
teacher:Between two numbersOkay so Anna what did you get,5
teacher:What two whole numbers is that one in between,5
teacher:So you think how many twos in five,5
teacher:He said there are two and then theres how much leftover,5
teacher:What would the division problem be,5
teacher:But tell me what is that,5
teacher:So what is the strategy for solving this if you didnt know your twelves,5
teacher:Whats the strategy,5
teacher:And they tell you what strategies to use,5
teacher:What are some different strategies that you guys used to come up with a mixed number for that,5
teacher:What did you think of Caleb,5
teacher:But you showed me something What did you show me,5
teacher:Okay so one and then what do we do with that one;student:One,5
teacher:Did you guys come up with one,5
teacher:Neither of you guys came up with one,5
teacher:Okay can you come up and explain yours,5
teacher:What tool,5
teacher:Any other any other things that youve heard or said that you would like to share,5
teacher:Tell me more;student:Division,5
teacher:What is the value,5
teacher:So what is the value of the 7 in 87,5
teacher:What number does that represent,5
teacher:What is the value of 7 in 78,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:What is the value of seven in 7890,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:Okay value of five in 152,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:Fifty,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:What is the value of the two,5
teacher:Hopefully that kind of reactivated what you what we talked about what we used this week we used what did you say,5
teacher:What is the tool or strategy that weve used this week already,5
teacher:Okay so have we learned any strategies about adding fractions and subtracting fractions yet,5
teacher:And how are we going to do it,5
teacher:Whats another one,5
teacher:So I want to can you guys give me another name for three and 23,5
teacher:Whats the number three and two thirds,5
teacher:If you have one left over it would be;student:One and 13,5
teacher:Can you show me a mixed number,5
teacher:Heres one whole number and then whats left,5
teacher:How many thirds,5
teacher:Improper fraction,5
teacher:How many thirds are left;student:Theres two and two thirds,5
teacher:Could you pull two wholes out and then what would be the fraction,5
teacher:So two would be this many and what would your fraction be,5
teacher:Or one and,5
teacher:So what is that next number,5
teacher:How many parts does it take to make a whole,5
teacher:So youre accounting for this one how many thirds is that,5
teacher:But I want you to think in your head what are we going to be doing today,5
teacher:How many thirds are left,5
teacher:Improper fraction;student:So the only,5
teacher:We can also compose it into what would be the improper fractions here anybody,5
teacher:Isaac can you give me an example of a fraction thats greater than one,5
teacher:So what number is that;student:I would show that if you see from in the fifths section three fifths is less than the number that you would even multiply or add together,5
teacher:Three fifths is less than what,5
teacher:Is there another tool you could show me with,5
teacher:So does somebody feel really confident about talking about an answer,5
teacher:But if youre talking to somebody who doesnt know anything doesnt know the algorithm for adding and subtracting fractions how are you going to tell me,5
teacher:Todays lesson is going to be youre going to be successful if you can tell me conceptually what is 512,5
teacher:And if you subtract one tenth from it could I get my five tenths,5
teacher:What do you know about 5 tenths,5
teacher:Caleb what do you know about 5 tenths off the top of your head,5
teacher:What do you know about five tenths and subtracting,5
teacher:What is that,5
teacher:What is that;student:Its five tenths,5
teacher:What does that answer,5
teacher:So if youre taking something away to get to a half that first number needs to be,5
teacher:So is five twelfths more than,5
teacher:Tell me a different way,5
teacher:You have the answer,5
teacher:So I can what;student:So you can know what we learned,5
teacher:Cause when I give you guys a quiz what am I trying to do;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Because the larger the numerator the larger the,5
teacher:That important word and then it works because the smaller the whats that word,5
teacher:What about this one,5
teacher:Whats a good strategy for making sure that your your sentences make sense,5
teacher:What would you get,5
teacher:What if you did the other one,5
teacher:What would you end up with,5
teacher:So wheres 412ths going to be,5
teacher:So the only other option was to put the parentheses around the five divided by the three so five divided by three would be,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:What do you think it is;student:So can I say what I think,5
teacher:Howd you whatd you think,5
teacher:What does extract mean,5
teacher:So what do you suppose assessment,5
teacher:Estimate and assess the,5
teacher:What do you suppose that might mean,5
teacher:So what did you do,5
teacher:Ninetyfive;student:Eight hundred,5
teacher:So do you know how to add 312ths and 412ths,5
teacher:What did you end up with,5
teacher:Okay so what did you Whats your answer,5
teacher:After;student:Like you wouldnt be closest to one half,5
teacher:A half minus seven,5
teacher:So what do we know about this,5
teacher:So half minus a little bit less than half is closer to,5
teacher:So on your number line I want you to label where the amount that take mode interval,5
teacher:How many hours did he mowed over the weekend,5
teacher:How do you want to show us,5
teacher:Just talk us through it,5
teacher:So you go ahead and mark what you think is 12344;student:And then a third is,5
teacher:Where would that be,5
teacher:And then youre going to do what,5
teacher:Can you give me an example of a mixed number,5
teacher:Okay so Eric can you give me an example of a mixed number,5
teacher:How about a fraction greater than one,5
teacher:half minus 717,5
teacher:So is this expression closer to one half or 01,5
teacher:Tell me whether you think one half minor 717 is closer to one half or zero,5
teacher:Alright so um so Andrea what do you think,5
teacher:And think about where would that be on this number line,5
teacher:Wheres the sum going to be on your number line,5
teacher:Lets think about how do we add how do we add up fractions,5
teacher:If we have 412ths plus 312ths how do we do that,5
teacher:How do we add fractions,5
teacher:What do we start with,5
teacher:What do you know about about the sum of that,5
teacher:312ths and 412ths,5
teacher:Can you do you know how to add 412ths plus 312ths,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:Tell me in terms of this,5
teacher:So we can we can count 123 12ths plus 1234 equals how many 12ths,5
teacher:And where are you going to put them on your on your number line,5
teacher:Is it closer to one or two,5
teacher:Is 1213ths plus 78ths going to be closer to one or two,5
teacher:So what do you think,5
teacher:Avery what do you start with,5
teacher:Thats in the what place,5
teacher:What is that number Natalie,5
teacher:How much flour do they need in all,5
teacher:How much longer did she listen to the radio on Sunday,5
teacher:How much longer,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:How many minutes is that,5
teacher:Um would somebody like to share their sum,5
teacher:Okay can you think of a model or a tool that you can use to predict;student:Then you just add the sixths,5
teacher:Okay anybody else have one they want to share and to explain it in a little bit of a different way,5
teacher:Okay so Avery would you be willing to come show your work,5
teacher:Because not only what can you make one out of,5
teacher:So what are some Whats another just using his ideas what are some other fractions that you could use,5
teacher:Whatever what sizes of pieces could you use differently,5
teacher:So you also could do so what Im asking is can you think of any others,5
teacher:So if we started with like what you did here can you think of a different denominator besides twos and fives;student:Like the x up in the top right corner,5
teacher:Whats another fraction for a half,5
teacher:Two fourths plus four eighths plus;student:Four eighths,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:I would say how much sandwich did they eat all together,5
teacher:How much sandwich did they both eat,5
teacher:What would be the number model for that,5
teacher:What is that,5
teacher:Whats that;student:And if you take,5
teacher:Joey what did you do,5
teacher:Okay so your answer was;student:And there are two eighths remaining from this,5
teacher:How can you use your fraction pieces to represent a half plus a fourth,5
teacher:Okay so what are some ways that you can what would you do to make sure that you have the same size pieces so you can add these two fractions,5
teacher:So what is the answer,5
teacher:What is a different one,5
teacher:What would be an estimate for a half plus a third,5
teacher:So what was your estimate be,5
teacher:So what size is that,5
teacher:How is this problem different than the other ones,5
teacher:How is this problem different than the other ones,5
teacher:What size is common to both of them,5
teacher:How much glue did he use altogether,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:So its not one of these what would be a half plus a third,5
teacher:Would anybody like to come up and demonstrate how they figured out the answer,5
teacher:So which ones are sixths,5
teacher:So you said two thirds plus what,5
teacher:What do you do when when you read a problem and youre like I have no idea,5
teacher:Whats the first thing you do,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:From;student:Get help,5
teacher:Or;student:The teacher,5
teacher:Okay so what are some problem solving strategies that you can use to get started,5
teacher:How much fruit punch will she have,5
teacher:Okay try to solve that with your partner,5
teacher:Okay so not only do I want you to solve it but I want you to think about what strategy to use;student:One half plus one half equals one,5
teacher:How are you going to prove your answer to me,5
teacher:What else could you use,5
teacher:What could you use to prove it,5
teacher:Can anybody think of another one,5
teacher:Do you have another way,5
teacher:Any other suggestions about how you thought about that,5
teacher:To keep going when a problem is challenging,5
teacher:Does anybody want to share what strategies you use,5
teacher:Or can you show me two ways to prove your answer,5
teacher:This is I will often if you finish early as a challenge to you can you show me two different ways that this problem could have been solved,5
teacher:Models often,5
teacher:Okay you know that somebody want to explain that,5
teacher:Jason you want to explain that one,5
teacher:What is that closest to,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:George will you explain that one to me,5
teacher:What number are you talking about;student:You look at So to get two you need one more eighth,5
teacher:What else did you have Tom,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:So Im thinking four thirds is the same as what mixed number,5
teacher:What strategies do you use to keep going when a problem is challenging,5
teacher:What are the units,5
teacher:So what are they talking about,5
teacher:Are they talking about inches,5
teacher:Are they talking about feet,5
teacher:And can you solve the problem another way,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:Okay angle B is congruent to which angle,5
teacher:What if you did that,5
teacher:If we start with two thirds whats it take what do you need to add to two thirds to get to one,5
teacher:So what did you start with,5
teacher:What is this closest to,5
teacher:So what operations,5
teacher:Addition subtraction multiplication division,5
teacher:Okay so two minus and then what is this close to;student:Subtraction,5
teacher:So is it close to one one and a half or two,5
teacher:And that equals two minus one and a half is what,5
teacher:So what is our number model,5
teacher:What is the number model,5
teacher:Minus one and four sixths equals;student:Two and one sixth minus one and four sixths,5
teacher:Okay and and then to solve it what did you do,5
teacher:How did you solve this,5
teacher:So the answer is the answer one half or is the answer one and three sixths,5
teacher:Can you guys talk to your neighbors about what you think,5
teacher:What do you think about that,5
teacher:What are you starting with;student:Three,5
teacher:What would an estimate be for this one,5
teacher:Okay so what would the estimate be for this one,5
teacher:How did you figure this out,5
teacher:How many cups of flour do they need Isaac,5
teacher:Okay and did you estimate that,5
teacher:Okay or how many thirds is that,5
teacher:So if we added can somebody come up and show us how you would use the number line,5
teacher:And show that two thirds plus two thirds is one and a third,5
teacher:Okay can you show us on here;student:And you could just add the top and thats four,5
teacher:And then if we added another two thirds what would you do with that,5
teacher:Is the answer one and a half or is the answer one and three sixths,5
teacher:So ask your neighbor about what advantages there are to using a number line,5
teacher:Okay so what is the what is the good thing about using a number line,5
teacher:Okay so what was your estimate,5
teacher:Two plus two and a half equal;student:My estimate was two plus two and a half,5
teacher:So what would be the number model for this,5
teacher:What number model did you end up with,5
teacher:Okay so all right what are some strategies that you guys came up with,5
teacher:How did you how did you answer it,5
teacher:Okay so lets talk for a minute about what is what the benefits are of using the number one whats good about that,5
teacher:How are you going to figure out what that equals,5
teacher:How did you do it,5
teacher:So whats left,5
teacher:Which ones bigger,5
teacher:Which one is bigger,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:Which is bigger 14 plus two fourths or one half,5
teacher:Which one is bigger,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:Which ones bigger,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:Which one is bigger,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:So what do you know,5
teacher:So if you start with a half what does it take to make a whole,5
teacher:Is a third bigger or smaller than a half,5
teacher:Which one is bigger,5
teacher:What does it take a since were just comparing it to one,5
teacher:Okay how about two thirds and one half,5
teacher:Okay show me,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:Which is bigger three eighths or a half,5
teacher:So do you want to show us how you did that,5
teacher:What is seven sixths now;student:Yeah,5
teacher:When you hear equivalent fractions what does that make you think,5
teacher:Equivalent is what,5
teacher:So fractions that are equal and how do you figure out whether fractions are equal,5
teacher:So in this particular fraction the five is what is the five the five is the,5
teacher:It tells us the denominator tells us what Isaiah,5
teacher:So then what did you do with that,5
teacher:What does the denominator tell us,5
teacher:On your whiteboard I want you to for the first for the two fractions that they show show me oh which one is larger,5
teacher:So on the first one three fourths and one half which one is larger,5
teacher:Which is larger,5
teacher:Which is bigger,5
teacher:Okay show me which ones bigger,5
teacher:Which one is bigger,5
teacher:So we know for the first one three fourths is bigger which is bigger three eights or a half,5
teacher:So total parts you make how many parts of that size does it take to make one whole,5
teacher:Pedro what you thinking;student:Yes,5
teacher:What is the angle a matchup with,5
teacher:Okay so someone in here was our third one,5
teacher:What could we multiply in our ratio table,5
teacher:Hunter can you tell us one way that we could get to 15 milliliters of red paint,5
teacher:Travis how else do you think we can do this,5
teacher:What could we do to get our maroon value up to 80,5
teacher:What do you think we could do,5
teacher:Do you see any numbers in this maroon category that we could easily multiply to get to 80,5
teacher:Do we have a way that we can easily get from eight to 80,5
teacher:What would we multiply by;student:Yeah,5
teacher:So looking at this Charlie what is one of our parts,5
teacher:The kids wearing sneakers youre right and how many kids were wearing sneakers;student:The kids wearing sneakers,5
teacher:What was the ratio,5
teacher:What is our other part Hunter,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Wayne what is one of our parts in this problem today,5
teacher:What is one of the things were comparing;student:One of the parts,5
teacher:Victor what are your thoughts about how are we going to get from three to six,5
teacher:Hunter what could we multiply to get our marinade up to 42,5
teacher:This says suppose you have six milliliters of blue paint how much of each color paint is included,5
teacher:Can you show me that;student:Two,5
teacher:Or do you have a question about one of these that you would like to answer,5
teacher:Which one would you like to examine a little bit closer;student:And I think that number two is false,5
teacher:Number one or number two,5
teacher:Giana would you like to identify one of these statements that is true,5
teacher:One of these statements that is false,5
teacher:Sorry did you say true or false for number one,5
teacher:45 fifths what do you think about that,5
teacher:How could we simplify that,5
teacher:What would that be equal to,5
teacher:What times five is 45,5
teacher:Next person Timothy you get to identify one that is true or false or ask the question,5
teacher:Okay which ones true do you think;student:I would like to identify the one that is true,5
teacher:Travis where do you think four came from,5
teacher:So in total crew how many milliliters of blue paint does this point represent,5
teacher:Or how many milliliters of maroon paint will this represent,5
teacher:Show me on your fingers how many milliliters this is going to represent of paint,5
teacher:How many dollars is that,5
teacher:How many dollars is that,5
teacher:Adelle what are your thoughts about that first question;student:Its one dollar,5
teacher:Campbell how would we write how much money a dime is,5
teacher:How can we do that with decimals,5
teacher:What percent would it be,5
teacher:Avery how would we write a quarter as a decimal,5
teacher:And then what percentage of a dollar is it;student:25,5
teacher:Okay lets do a half dollar now,5
teacher:50 and how would we write it as a decimal;student:50,5
teacher:Yeah what percent of a dollar is it;student:Wouldnt that just be 1,5
teacher:Where did I get what from;student:Where did you get it from,5
teacher:So what are some decimals you feel like you already know,5
teacher:All right Brett what is one that you would like to fill in,5
teacher:What would that be equivalent to,5
teacher:Catalina what are you thinking,5
teacher:All right SS with a raised hand can you tell me which other ones you would like to fill in,5
teacher:What are some other ones you knew,5
teacher:And what percentage would that be;student:05,5
teacher:How would we write that as a decimal,5
teacher:Aubrey can you tell me what is a nickel equivalent to,5
teacher:And then Brett what percentage of a dollar is a penny,5
teacher:Tell us more;student:I think it would be 25 of a dollar,5
teacher:How we might be able to get that fraction,5
teacher:do you want to talk a little bit about that,5
teacher:Did you have anything else you wanted to add,5
teacher:How many cents is that,5
teacher:I could also say a pen costs one and 50 hundredths dollars how many cents is that,5
teacher:Bethany what is your thought on question number two,5
teacher:A statement thats false,5
teacher:Wayne what do you think,5
teacher:Heres my next question how many cents are in one dollar,5
teacher:Clay how many cents are in one dollar,5
teacher:Now have you heard cent as part of any other vocabulary words;student:100,5
teacher:Archer where have you heard cent before,5
teacher:100 what Augustus;student:Hello century is 100,5
teacher:How many legs does a centipede supposedly have,5
teacher:So Brett how much is a penny worth,5
teacher:Adelle B what are you thinking,5
teacher:Oh would you like to tell us a statement thats true;student:Oh Sorry,5
teacher:What strategy do you use to compare ratios,5
teacher:Dixie what do you think;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Yeah what did we divide it by;student:Oh divided,5
teacher:What did we do Leo to get from the second column to the third column,5
teacher:Paulina what could we divide both of those by,5
teacher:Do you guys want to do four,5
teacher:Peter do you want to help me with dividing by four,5
teacher:So what is 12 divided by four,5
teacher:Do you want to help me with that,5
teacher:So 12 divided by three is four and then,5
teacher:Can you tell us I got a dollar and 8 cents,5
teacher:What would that be,5
teacher:Liliana what do you think our last step should be,5
teacher:So what should we do,5
teacher:Well should we divide it by,5
teacher:With a raised hand can you tell me what you think that the 24 represents,5
teacher:what do you think that it represents;student:It represents 24 minutes,5
teacher:So from our first column to our second column Lilani what did we do from our first column to our second column,5
teacher:26 so who can go more miles on a gallon of gas;student:26,5
teacher:And how many did Frankies mom get;student:23,5
teacher:How much did she get for one gallon,5
teacher:Hey Micah when someone says unit rates what does that mean to you,5
teacher:What are unit rates;student:What was the question,5
teacher:What were we trying to scale it down to,5
teacher:What do you think of Paulina;student:I dont really know how to explain it,5
teacher:Frankie what do you think what unit rate is,5
teacher:You guys know what MPG is,5
teacher:What is it cam,5
teacher:how much time did Winnie spend exercising,5
teacher:And do you want that number to be higher or do you want it to be lower,5
teacher:Although what about if you were to do like a Tesla;student:Low,5
teacher:What do you think about those,5
teacher:Whatd you get,5
teacher:Hey can you tell us how you got 156;student:156,5
teacher:You tell me how you got 78,5
teacher:Hey Neil which mom do you think gets better gas mileage,5
teacher:So how many miles per gallon did Sammys mom get,5
teacher:So like big trucks do they have a high or low MPG,5
teacher:Annabelle what were some other ones you knew,5
teacher:Rodney can you tell us one thing that you noticed that is the same or one thing you noticed that is different,5
teacher:They both went 30  what is something that you noticed that is the same or is different,5
teacher:So for every one liter of orange juice how much soda water do we have;student:Sure,5
teacher:What is our goal,5
teacher:What do we want to try and get to,5
teacher:Now is it easier to get the orange juice to one or the soda water to one and one third;student:Were trying to get to one,5
teacher:Which one do you think is easier,5
teacher:So that part thats circled in yellow  can you tell us what that means,5
teacher:The part thats circled in yellow,5
teacher:So what is the one in the orange juice mean compared to the one and one fourth in the soda water,5
teacher:So if I were to say this to you For every one liter of orange juice there is how much soda water;student:Well I guess it means that its not equivalent to them,5
teacher:So which one of those do you think is going to be more orange,5
teacher:Have more orange tastes to it,5
teacher:Which one do you think will have more orange taste to it,5
teacher:Im going to say which mixture is more orangy,5
teacher:Those of you in the room which one do you think is more orangy,5
teacher:Yes Adalee you can explain;student:No,5
teacher:Caylin what do you think that information actually means in a ratio table so far,5
teacher:So what does that information actually mean,5
teacher:What are you thinking sweetie,5
teacher:How much soda water,5
teacher:Who burns more calories,5
teacher:anything else you noticed,5
teacher:What about the incline;student:The incline,5
teacher:What are you thinking,5
teacher:What do you guys think about if we were to compare these two,5
teacher:Dixie what do you think;student:She has more calories and its less,5
teacher:What do you think when you hear the term Same Rate,5
teacher:How far did they go,5
teacher:If someone tells you the Same Rate what does that mean to you,5
teacher:And what would be the same;student:That something is the same,5
teacher:And whats a rate,5
teacher:What do you mean by equivalent,5
teacher:Can you give me an example,5
teacher:Do you have an example;student:I dont know,5
teacher:ow many circles should I draw for Terrance,5
teacher:how many squares should I draw for Terrance,5
teacher:when you hear same rates what does that mean to you,5
teacher:What is a unit rate,5
teacher:Tell us how you figured that out,5
teacher:All right what else would you guys like to fill in,5
teacher:Kalen you are on a streak my friend what do you think,5
teacher:Okay howd you get 36;student:I got 36,5
teacher:Would you like to share your idea Leslie,5
teacher:So one says 9 is 75 of what number,5
teacher:So what are you thinking Alfie,5
teacher:What do you guys think,5
teacher:Now without telling us the answer is there somebody who would like to share a strategy,5
teacher:What are they looking for,5
teacher:As theyre trying to find the two fractions whos sum is closest to zero,5
teacher:Whats your strategy,5
teacher:What other strategies are you guys looking for,5
teacher:Which two numbers would you pick,5
teacher:So Leo can you tell us what is a strategy that we might be able to use to solve this problem,5
teacher:How come;student:78,5
teacher:Theodore what are you thinking,5
teacher:So if 9 is 25 what would 100 be,5
teacher:Well we could add 110 to something else Theodore do you see what we could eliminate;student:Im thinking 110,5
teacher:The next one says 9 is 25 of what number,5
teacher:So it says 9 is 10 of what number;student:So do you want me to find 100 or 10,5
teacher:So what would 20 divided by 4 be,5
teacher:So then were going to take 500 and multiply it by 3 and what would that give us,5
teacher:All right the next one there Kabir P can you walk us through how to find three fourths of a 24 hour day,5
teacher:So our first one is 9 is 50 of what number,5
teacher:So our first question is 9 is half of what number,5
teacher:So Magnus 9 is half or 50 of what number,5
teacher:So that one we could also say 9 is half of what number,5
teacher:So what number when you divide it by two are or you find 50 of it you would get 9,5
teacher:What would that be,5
teacher:What would the whole be,5
teacher:Okay Im going to go down here to 9 is 10 of what number,5
teacher:The question is asking 9 is 50 of what number,5
teacher:So 10 what number would be 100,5
teacher:If 10 is 9 what number would be 100,5
teacher:Lets see Deacon what do you think,5
teacher:So if 9 is 10 what number would be 100,5
teacher:Which of your other two do you think we should add together to get as close to one half as possible,5
teacher:Hunter what are your thoughts,5
teacher:Okay how do you add those together;student:I dont know if this goes over or not but 38 and 16,5
teacher:Arriana what do you think,5
teacher:To get from three to 18 what did we multiply Theodore,5
teacher:What did we multiply by,5
teacher:How did I get from three to 18;student:18 Wait,5
teacher:What did I multiply by,5
teacher:To get from six to 18 Hunter what did I multiply by,5
teacher:Julia what should I do next,5
teacher:What are we going to do next;student:Sorry I know you asked me a question but you cut out I only heard my name,5
teacher:So Julia whats five plus eight,5
teacher:No three plus five,5
teacher:And then whats 1218 plus 1518,5
teacher:What should we do next Sammie,5
teacher:What would it be,5
teacher:How many times will 18 go into 27,5
teacher:Yep and then what would be left over;student:Once it wouldnt go twice,5
teacher:What is a common multiple of three and six,5
teacher:Whats a number that we can count by threes and we can count by fives and theyll land on the same number,5
teacher:What do you think Aubree,5
teacher:When we are looking for a common multiple what is a common multiple of three and five,5
teacher:How do you add them together,5
teacher:So Hunter which are the two you wanted to try and add together,5
teacher:What is a common multiple of six and eight,5
teacher:So 1324 what do you guys think about that,5
teacher:Its really close to half how close to half is it;student:Its close,5
teacher:One fraction whats the size of that fraction;student:One,5
teacher:So 16 and 38 is there anything else you guys might want to try,5
teacher:And what would that be;student:And then you would multiply by three,5
teacher:To see if we can get closer,5
teacher:Whats the least common multiple of eight and 10,5
teacher:I see youve got your hand Arriana what are you thinking,5
teacher:How close is that one,5
teacher:Which ones closer,5
teacher:And Julia what do you think,5
teacher:Which ones going to be closer to one half,5
teacher:Yeah what are you thinking Hunter,5
teacher:What is their least common multiple,5
teacher:So lets do this lets do 10 divided by 4 what would 10 divided by 4 be;student:Yeah so I did 10 divided by 75 and I got 75,5
teacher:Can you help me with the first one;student:Sorry can you repeat that,5
teacher:So Meredith will you help me with the first one,5
teacher:Carson do you want to do the last one for us,5
teacher:Whats the pattern Augustus;student:I think theres a pattern,5
teacher:How many tickets are for chaperones and how many are for students,5
teacher:How many tickets are for chaperones and how many tickets are for students,5
teacher:What do you think our parts could be Danielle,5
teacher:So what should we put in this total box here,5
teacher:Colten what should we put in that box for the total,5
teacher:Howd you get 17;student:Seventeen,5
teacher:What do you think you can do to your ratio table to get from 17 to 85,5
teacher:Elise what should we try next,5
teacher:Which one times five;student:Times five,5
teacher:What can I do next to my ratio table to try and get the total to 85,5
teacher:Clarissa will you share your strategy with us,5
teacher:What did you multiply times three,5
teacher:So that would be 90 and 12 and,5
teacher:Annabelle what are your thoughts,5
teacher:What do you think Alexa,5
teacher:Okay whats 58 going to be;student:58,5
teacher:Which one you like to do 58 or 78,5
teacher:What else did you know,5
teacher:Yeah whats 15;student:I know the 15,5
teacher:How did you figure it out;student:Its 2,5
teacher:So Carson if every time we add 15 we add 2 what would 25 be,5
teacher:Which one you like to add;student:I think I have one figured out,5
teacher:Which fraction is that;student:I knew the fifth one,5
teacher:Sure whats 16 going to be;student:The 16,5
teacher:So our actual question says how many tickets are for chaperones and how many are for students,5
teacher:What is 16 going to be;student:That one,5
teacher:Yeah how did you get that one;student:The next one will be 83,5
teacher:Frankie what would 13 be,5
teacher:If we know that 13 is 3 repeating what do you think 23 is going to be;student:Yes,5
teacher:Add one more thing to a 6;student:6,5
teacher:So what would 38 be then,5
teacher:Catalina what do you think;student:I dont know,5
teacher:Can you tell us how you got that,5
teacher:Alison what else did you have to add sweetie,5
teacher:River do you want to tell us one you figured out,5
teacher:What was it,5
teacher:to get to 8,5
teacher:How did you get 75;student:75,5
teacher:The blue one is 50 they added one more what;student:and then they added one more,5
teacher:What is this divided up into,5
teacher:Im going to have MNashna can you read your response that you wrote on slide three,5
teacher:Kabir P will you also read yours,5
teacher:And Joanna will you read your response,5
teacher:So Im going to start with Meredith Meredith can you read your strategy for how you found 10 of something,5
teacher:Deacon what is 10 of a 2000 kilometer trip what would that be,5
teacher:Magnus what would 10 of a 24 hour day be,5
teacher:Yeah what would 10 of a 24 hour day be,5
teacher:If you divide 24 by 10 what would we get,5
teacher:So crew what are your thoughts about how we could find 75,5
teacher:And Kalen that would give us what one fourth would be,5
teacher:So Kalen what was your first step to be able to find 75,5
teacher:What was your next step Kalen,5
teacher:Can you tell us what fraction or what percent is shaded in,5
teacher:What did you say what percent shaded in,5
teacher:Alfie what do you think,5
teacher:Deacon what do you think,5
teacher:How much oil to use if you want to make a total of 28 teaspoons of dressing;student:Im not exactly sure oil,5
teacher:Ainsley do you want to tackle that,5
teacher:How you got from 7 to 28,5
teacher:What other strategies did you guys use to get from 7 to 28,5
teacher:Ellen what did you do,5
teacher:I just heard one of your classmates so what did you do first,5
teacher:What percentages did they say,5
teacher:Colten can you tell me whats going to happen,5
teacher:I want you to think to yourself what is a fraction equivalent for one of these percents,5
teacher:Do you want to give us a fraction equivalent for 10 25 50 or 75,5
teacher:Okay whats the fraction equivalent for 10;student:10 maybe,5
teacher:Can anybody simplify that to tell us what benchmark fraction it might be close to when you simplify it,5
teacher:Caleb are you going to tell us,5
teacher:All right what fraction would that be equivalent to;student:I could do 25 since its the next one,5
teacher:Christie how did you get 25 over 100,5
teacher:You were totally right Christie now if we simplify this how could we simplify 25 over this,5
teacher:Okay I want you to think of what is a fraction equivalent for one of these percents here,5
teacher:Wyatt P what do you think that a common multiple between five and eight could be,5
teacher:So from this morning who can give me a good definition of the word unit rates,5
teacher:And now if these were a treat that you really liked Micah would you rather be the dog or be the cat,5
teacher:I liked your  what was your for every example,5
teacher:And it says if you sorted this set by color how many groups would you have,5
teacher:What if you sorted by area,5
teacher:What categories would you use,5
teacher:How many groups would you have,5
teacher:But I want you to tell me how would you think about sorting these different little shapes,5
teacher:So I would think about like how many different color groups do you see there;student:But then what do you do on that,5
teacher:How many different areas do you have,5
teacher:So crew when we talk about color how many different color groups do you guys see,5
teacher:Dexter have many different color groups do you see,5
teacher:What colors do you see,5
teacher:What are the different areas that you guys see,5
teacher:So how many different areas do you guys see,5
teacher:Dexter did you think of another category,5
teacher:Can anybody think of a different way that we could categorize or we could sort these shapes,5
teacher:What did you have,5
teacher:How many different shapes do you see,5
teacher:For every,5
teacher:I would love to see some hands about what is a ratio,5
teacher:Can you give us the gist of this problem,5
teacher:Douglas can you give us the gist of this problem,5
teacher:Can you give us the gist of this problem,5
teacher:Whats going on in this problem;student:Yeah,5
teacher:So crew I want you to think to yourself is this problem asking you for GCF or is it asking you for LCM,5
teacher:Adriana what do you think,5
teacher:GCF or LCM,5
teacher:Do you think GCF or LCM;student:I think GCF,5
teacher:Corey do you think GCF or LCM,5
teacher:Alan C do you think GCF or LCM;student:I think LCM,5
teacher:And Ashley what do you think GCF or LCM,5
teacher:What would they look going to;student:I think its GCF because,5
teacher:What is the largest number of snack bags she can make,5
teacher:Thats your first one decide if thats GCF or LCM,5
teacher:So I want you to think to yourself are those problems Is the first one LCM or GCF and is the second one LCM or GCF,5
teacher:For every,5
teacher:How many different shapes do you guys see,5
teacher:How many do you see,5
teacher:Joanna what was the other way that you saw that you can start your shape,5
teacher:So before we do anything else if you mix blue paint and white paint can you raise your hand and tell me whats going to happen,5
teacher:If you have blue paint and you add some white paint whats going to happen,5
teacher:Emanual whats going to happen if you do that,5
teacher:What do you think about that one,5
teacher:What do you think about that one,5
teacher:What is one of the diagrams that it could possible be Greta,5
teacher:Were doing sentence one but which diagram could it be;student:Could it be sentence one,5
teacher:Which one of these diagrams is representing 5 of something compared to 2 of something,5
teacher:Hunter which one do you think it is,5
teacher:What would happen if we triple it,5
teacher:If we draw a picture what would our picture look like,5
teacher:What happens if you double that recipe,5
teacher:Whats going go happen,5
teacher:Which diagram is it,5
teacher:So how are we representing tomato sauce,5
teacher:Hunter Im going to let you tackle the last one,5
teacher:Would you like to tackle that answer that question Hunter;student:But Im just kind of confused on what it would be,5
teacher:How does that help you;student:Instead of 14 times 24 I think of it as onefourth of 24,5
teacher:Would anyone else like to share their strategy for this last one,5
teacher:What are some ways we could categorize this collection,5
teacher:Lindsey can you talk about your different categories,5
teacher:How many different types of dinosaurs do you guys see,5
teacher:What do you guys think,5
teacher:Charlie can you read your first one,5
teacher:Elise can you read yours for us,5
teacher:Colette can you read yours for us,5
teacher:You thought LCM can you support your answer,5
teacher:Cooper can you read yours,5
teacher:Do you want to read these two Calvin,5
teacher:Is there anyone else who would like to share theirs,5
teacher:Elaine can you tell us what you would do for this one,5
teacher:Whats your strategy,5
teacher:Can you tell us a little bit about your strategies,5
teacher:You think 14 is what;student:I dont really know how to explain it,5
teacher:What are we doing to 24,5
teacher:Arthur will you read yours for us,5
teacher:Donavan do you think GCF or LCM,5
teacher:Derrick do you think GCF or LCM,5
teacher:Angelica do you think GCF or LCM,5
teacher:How many wholes would I have if I have two and two fourths,5
teacher:And then;student:And then,5
teacher:How many pieces are these wholes cut into,5
teacher:What does my fraction tell me,5
teacher:So now were going to look at some situations and were going to think critically today about does this problem require me to use common multiples or does it require me to use common factors,5
teacher:If we have one group who is clapping on every other beat and one group who is snapping on every third beat what should we not expect should happen,5
teacher:Adriana what would happen,5
teacher:What do you think will happen,5
teacher:Alexa what do you think will happen,5
teacher:Adelle what do you think,5
teacher:to collide every 24th beat is that a GCF or is that an LCM or is that a common multiple or a common factor,5
teacher:Adriana what are you thinking,5
teacher:What do you notice about six and 12,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:Crew when you are determining if a problem is an LCM problem what are you looking for,5
teacher:But if I was going to draw a picture of two and two fourths how many wholes would I have,5
teacher:And it has what,5
teacher:What does it have Elliot,5
teacher:Give me one of them,5
teacher:So what happened to this 10 to turn it into a hundred,5
teacher:Im going to,5
teacher:So what am I multiplying 10 by to turn it into a hundred,5
teacher:And whatever I do to the lower one,5
teacher:So now what you do is you multiply five times 10 and that is;student:You have to do it on the bathroom,5
teacher:How many pieces do I have in all in my fraction,5
teacher:How many pieces,5
teacher:What is the signal to you that you have an LCM problem or a problem involving LCM,5
teacher:So if I have a pizza this fraction shows me that my pizza is cut into two pieces but how many pieces out of the two do I have colored it,5
teacher:How many pieces are in this one;student:Hmm,5
teacher:How many pieces are there;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Sorry moving over to mixed numbers who can give me an example of a mixed number,5
teacher:Jose can you give me an example of a mixed number,5
teacher:Okay Jose can you give me an example of a mixed number;student:Yes,5
teacher:Kumar give me an example of a mixed number;student:Ms,5
teacher:Give me an example of a mixed number;student:What did you say,5
teacher:So if I asked what is my whole in three halves how many pieces would make a whole if I have two in all,5
teacher:What shape are we using,5
teacher:What are you thinking Alicia,5
teacher:Are you listing factors or multiples,5
teacher:Five would be how many,5
teacher:So we see 24 on both of our lists but what does this 24 actually tell us,5
teacher:What does it actually tell if my graph Adelle,5
teacher:How many packages of cups does she need and how many packages of plates,5
teacher:So Alexa how many packages of cups does she need,5
teacher:And how many packages of plates does she need,5
teacher:Whats the common factor of eight is six,5
teacher:MathLand can you hold up a common factor of eight and six for me with your fingers,5
teacher:Hey I want everyone to hold up a common factor of four and three,5
teacher:MathLand hold up a common factor of four and three,5
teacher:Okay so looking at this problem Crew do you think that this problem is asking us to do GCF or to do LCM;student:And Collin,5
teacher:Dont share it yet but do you think this is asking us for GCF or LCM,5
teacher:Connor do you think GCF or LCM,5
teacher:Corey do you think GCF or LCM,5
teacher:Damien do you think GCF or LCM;student:I think its LCM,5
teacher:Four would be how many,5
teacher:Five cups would be how many packages,5
teacher:Three cups would be how many packages,5
teacher:Two cups would be how many packages,5
teacher:So whats the big idea of this problem,5
teacher:What do you think Adriana,5
teacher:What is some important information in this problem that we should highlight,5
teacher:I want you guys to think to yourself is this problem asking us for GCF or is it asking us for LCM,5
teacher:Is this a GCM problem or a factors problem,5
teacher:Or is this an LCM or a multiples problem,5
teacher:Which one do you guys think,5
teacher:What are you thinking Alicia,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:What do you guys think will be the three rows,5
teacher:What do you think we should keep track of for this problem,5
teacher:Give me one thing you think we should keep track of,5
teacher:Brian what is one thing you think we should keep track of,5
teacher:Alicia whats another thing you think we should keep track of in our table,5
teacher:And then what else do you think,5
teacher:One package would be how many cups,5
teacher:Do you think this is a GCF problem or an LCM problem,5
teacher:What are you thinking,5
teacher:How are we representing oil,5
teacher:What if we did something like this,5
teacher:Ray what do you think,5
teacher:When youre ready will you type your answer into the chat,5
teacher:what are your thoughts,5
teacher:what are you thinking,5
teacher:Will you tell us your strategy for how you solve this,5
teacher:Okay keep going,5
teacher:Does anyone else have another strategy they want to share,5
teacher:James whats yours,5
teacher:Tell me what it looks like,5
teacher:Tell me what to do next,5
teacher:I want you to look at that and tell me what you noticed and what you wonder,5
teacher:What you noticed and what you wonder,5
teacher:what do you notice or wonder,5
teacher:Are they big numbers or are they small numbers;student:They are the main center of it besides  the numbers are really upfront,5
teacher:what do you notice or wonder,5
teacher:Aysa what do you think,5
teacher:Whats that called when you do one of something;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Charlie what do you think,5
teacher:What is the answer,5
teacher:Right here it says how many batches can you make with 15 cups of flour and six teaspoons of vanilla;student:Triple it,5
teacher:How can we get from five to 15,5
teacher:Since we multiplied by three were going to say how many batches can we make,5
teacher:This says how much flour and vanilla would you need for five batches of cookies,5
teacher:Gracelyn can you help me set this one up,5
teacher:What are we comparing for this question,5
teacher:Whats my ratio of flour to vanilla Leland,5
teacher:Whats my ratio of flour to vanilla,5
teacher:And then my question asks how much flour and vanilla would I need for five batches of cookies,5
teacher:In order to solve this problem Jericho whats my next step,5
teacher:What should I multiply it by,5
teacher:What do you think about multiplying it by five Jericho;student:Multiply by five,5
teacher:When I multiply two by five what would I get,5
teacher:Question number four says find another ratio of cups of flour to teaspoons of vanilla that is equivalent to these ratios,5
teacher:How can you solve this puzzle,5
teacher:So Saffron what do you think the answer could be,5
teacher:Do you remember that vocabulary,5
teacher:tell me what you noticed or wondered,5
teacher:What do you notice or wonder,5
teacher:What do you think Zane,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:Tess what are your thoughts,5
teacher:How can we get four to one,5
teacher:What could we do,5
teacher:So how much is three fourths of a dollar,5
teacher:How did you get that Riley,5
teacher:Napland what kind of creative solutions do you guys have,5
teacher:Hadley do you want to start us off with the dog or the cats,5
teacher:What are the two things that the dog is comparing;student:Dogs,5
teacher:And what did you get there,5
teacher:Can I get somebody from math lands to help me out with this one,5
teacher:What are we going to put for the cat,5
teacher:What should I put in this spot here for tricks,5
teacher:What should I put in this spot that I just circled through tricks;student:Wait what,5
teacher:When else have you guys seen unit rates in our class,5
teacher:Zizi how can we do this in one step,5
teacher:What information has been provided for us in the introduction to the problem,5
teacher:Can you tell me what two words were going to use in our ratio table,5
teacher:What could we describe those as,5
teacher:Carter what are you thinking,5
teacher:Was it a 12 pack or an eight pack,5
teacher:what do you think they are,5
teacher:what do you think the two things are,5
teacher:So which two numbers do we need to put in,5
teacher:what do you think,5
teacher:What are you tying to do,5
teacher:Okay how much do 16 avocados cost,5
teacher:What can we do to get our number of avocados to 16,5
teacher:Charlie whats your thoughts,5
teacher:Yeah Aysa what did you do;student:I did,5
teacher:What was your strategy,5
teacher:How much do nine avocados cost;student:I think I might have,5
teacher:We have a lot of data on our table already so we want to know how much do nine avocados cost,5
teacher:Elsa B whats your thoughts,5
teacher:Carter what could we do,5
teacher:Tell us what youre solving for,5
teacher:Celine what are the two things that were comparing with the ratio table,5
teacher:Mathlans can I please see your pictures for number one,5
teacher:Can you guys tell me other tools you have used in math,5
teacher:Can you tell me other tools you have used in math,5
teacher:Either this year or in elementary school,5
teacher:What other tools have you guys used,5
teacher:You have 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 and lets see Ophelia will you show me your picture of your yert,5
teacher:What do you mean;student:You were saying you dont write down 40 yerts,5
teacher:Because how many chaperones will they need,5
teacher:How many people campers and chaperones can go on the trip,5
teacher:So I need 35 chaperones on my trip so in your space next to A where is says How many chaperones,5
teacher:Question B says How many people campers and chaperones will go on the trip,5
teacher:So we know that we had how many people are going on the trip,5
teacher:How many extra bars will she have,5
teacher:Im going to pull a stick and What would you like to do first Penny,5
teacher:Penny what would you like to do first what could we do first to solve this,5
teacher:Does anyone have an idea for what I could do next,5
teacher:Nancy what are you thinking,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:So if 45 goes into 90 twice how many times will it go into 900,5
teacher:How many times,5
teacher:Hugh could you share your strategy with us please,5
teacher:Does anybody notice anything about those two numbers,5
teacher:Notice any common factors or something they might have in common,5
teacher:what did you notice about 1 and six tenths and 4 tenths,5
teacher:Did you notice anything about factors or maybe multiples of those two,5
teacher:Did anyone else notice anything about some factors and multiples of 4 tenths and 1 and six tenths,5
teacher:Did you notice something Charlie,5
teacher:Ophelia what should we do next,5
teacher:Can you talk about that a little more;student:I was just going to say that if you took away the decimal point it would just be 16 divided by 4,5
teacher:If you see 16 16 and a 4 well how can I manipulate that to make this problem a little bit easier to solve,5
teacher:Well what do you think;student:So were probably going to go over this in the next problem but the same strategy we just used Im assuming that it doesnt work when one of the numbers does not have a decimal,5
teacher:Do you notice any relationship between 90 and 45,5
teacher:Charlie since youre kind of on this what do you notice of the relationship between 90 and 45,5
teacher:Now help me find the answer,5
teacher:So how many time will go into 90,5
teacher:So how many times will 45 go into 900,5
teacher:Greyson whats 16 divided by 4,5
teacher:So  I have 150 skittles divided by six students would you share your strategy for how you solved this please,5
teacher:Ophelia can you help me add these two columns together,5
teacher:What should we do for our next step,5
teacher:Lucian which would you like to use,5
teacher:Which mixture would you like to have,5
teacher:What now,5
teacher:Charlie what do you notice about these two mixtures;student:But think about it almost four blocks would be the same amount of water,5
teacher:Your first question which is at the top of your page if you flip this over says how would the taste of mixture A compare to the taste of mixture B,5
teacher:How does mixture A compare to the taste of mixture B,5
teacher:Marvin what did you say for number one,5
teacher:Okay do you want to type it in the chat for us,5
teacher:While Marvin is typing Im curious Angelina what did you say for number one,5
teacher:What two numbers should we put in there,5
teacher:C says how would the taste of mixture B compare to the taste of mixture C,5
teacher:How would those two compare,5
teacher:What would happen if it didnt have that extra cup of water;student:And if it just has an extra cup of water then its not,5
teacher:We talked a little bit about this with our koolaid but this is what does it mean to double a recipe,5
teacher:Number two says how many batches can you make with 15 cups of flour and 6 teaspoons of vanilla,5
teacher:Tell us what you just realized Angelina;student:I would actually do A,5
teacher:Do you think that B is going to be super flavored or do you think its going to be more watereddown;student:Because if its super flavory it just doesnt taste as good,5
teacher:If we doubled it Alexia what do you think,5
teacher:If we doubled it how many would we have,5
teacher:Ismeal what do you think we should do,5
teacher:We should yeah what column should we add;student:We could add another column,5
teacher:So how many boxes will we have,5
teacher:So that means Ramona will need Yeah Mathland what do you think,5
teacher:What do you think Penny,5
teacher:Yeah how much will she have left over;student:I think Ramona will need 17 boxes,5
teacher:What do you think about that,5
teacher:Ophelia what did you get for 80 plus 48,5
teacher:And how many of each shape would be in two copies of this flower pattern,5
teacher:Frankie can you share yours with us,5
teacher:Okay how do you know that that one is correct;student:I agree,5
teacher:Lawrence really wanted to share what he has so far,5
teacher:So how is that a true thing,5
teacher:Our next question says how many of each shape would be in two copies of this flower pattern;student:Okay,5
teacher:Alani how many hexagons would we have in two copies of this flower,5
teacher:Okay how did you get that;student:Two,5
teacher:Lance can you start us off with one of your sentences,5
teacher:Juniper what do I need to multiply five by in order to get to 40,5
teacher:So we have 3240 and Julia what are we going to multiply 58 by,5
teacher:Okay Arriana help me add these together,5
teacher:Okay so all were solving is what is y when x equals three,5
teacher:All you need to do is think about what number What number are you replacing,5
teacher:So what is f of four in this problem,5
teacher:f of four,5
teacher:So were trying to figure out when x is four what is y,5
teacher:So find f of two what is f of two in this equation,5
teacher:And so what I want to hear from you is what happened,5
teacher:What What happened that the graph would look like this when you got out of your car at the grocery store,5
teacher:Alright so what happened,5
teacher:What happened after you got out of the car to go to the grocery store,5
teacher:Once you think about whats what would this graph what would this table look like,5
teacher:So some questions that might naturally come up in a problem like this is like well how many weeks can Antonio buy candy for,5
teacher:So your table should end after six weeks he has only 4 left then you might be thinking about okay well after how many weeks will he have no money left,5
teacher:And then I want to talk a little bit so as your graph it I want you to think about what does the y intercept tell you,5
teacher:And what does the What does the x intercept tell you,5
teacher:Whats the range,5
teacher:And be able to think about like what does the x intercept mean,5
teacher:And then whats the domain,5
teacher:Okay and Im going to just wait I want to see everybody first of all fill in the domain and range but then also let me know what do you think,5
teacher:Okay does anybody know what these three points have in common,5
teacher:Anybody see what these three points have in common,5
teacher:And you can just unmute once you notice whats the same about these points,5
teacher:Sarah What do you think your equation is Angelina,5
teacher:So on this question all I want you to do is write the equation whats the equation of that first line,5
teacher:Whats the equation of the second line,5
teacher:Okay Im gonna actually type out some points but I just want to see come up with a guess what do you think these equations are,5
teacher:If youre stuck think about whats the same and all these points on each graph,5
teacher:Because all of these points what do they have in common,5
teacher:So for this first one if its a flatline you can just think to yourself okay where does it cross the y axis at five,5
teacher:Okay now where is the slope,5
teacher:So which numbers in the domain match up to which numbers in the range,5
teacher:So where are the y values,5
teacher:And Id like you to draw the arrows and then decide do you think this is a function or not a function based on what you drew,5
teacher:Do you think this is a function or do you think this is not a function,5
teacher:once you put in your arrows do you think its a function or not,5
teacher:Can anybody tell me what the slope is,5
teacher:So whats happening here,5
teacher:Thats going to help you decide if its a linear function or not figure out whats happening to y every time are you going up or down,5
teacher:What does the slope mean in this problem,5
teacher:So what does this slope of negative five mean,5
teacher:Okay so what is slope,5
teacher:So what is the rise and the run between the two points,5
teacher:Remember to think about because some people left this off but is this a positive or a negative slope,5
teacher:What is the simplified version,5
teacher:Okay whats the slope of this line,5
teacher:Whats another thing you could do,5
teacher:But can someone tell me like in words what does this slope mean for this problem,5
teacher:Okay what is minus 1500 actually mean in this problem,5
teacher:For this airplane thats flying through the sky,5
teacher:The elevation drops by How does that sound Daphne,5
teacher:So whats the slope of this line,5
teacher:How are you going to figure out the slope and the equation for just two points,5
teacher:And so I wanted to know how did you think about the table,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:Okay so whats the slope,5
teacher:What is the slope,5
teacher:Okay and thats exactly right what is the slope or the rate of change,5
teacher:And by what amount,5
teacher:Okay Mallory can you tell me since were looking at yours whats the y intercept for this problem,5
teacher:Whats the y intercept,5
teacher:Whats the slope,5
teacher:How can you fill in this table,5
teacher:So what does this equation look like y equals negative 2x plus eight,5
teacher:Y equals negative 2x plus eight,5
teacher:And then I want to talk about how do you come up with an equation for a line that has a slope of zero and a line that has an undefined slope,5
teacher:What is the negative two mean,5
teacher:What is the plus eight mean,5
teacher:In equation,5
teacher:Domain was 01234 range was Ill go least to greatest 02456 Okay then I want to see your arrows how are you going to connect these points,5
teacher:So Corbina can you um can you say how youre thinking about this problem,5
teacher:So is this a function or not,5
teacher:And is this going to make a function or not,5
teacher:But what does it mean,5
teacher:In the equation,5
teacher:Okay so what are the intercepts on this graph,5
teacher:Okay and now the reason why I think it was super cool that Andre and Melissa they were the only two that I saw but maybe other people did this too is that now its like Okay well whats exactly in between one and four,5
teacher:Okay the other way you can think about your slope is what if you go down four over two,5
teacher:Frances what do you think,5
teacher:So because this one is bigger,5
teacher:Because this is bigger its going to mean more water gets added and if more water gets added is it going to be more orangey or less orangey,5
teacher:What is the least common multiple of four and five,5
teacher:What is the least common multiple of four  and five,5
teacher:Whats the least common multiple,5
teacher:So if we count by fours and fives whats the first number theyll land on together,5
teacher:For this point what quadrant or axis is the point located in,5
teacher:What is it showing you,5
teacher:And Id like you to type your story what story is this graph telling you,5
teacher:I want you to think about what is what is this graph even showing you,5
teacher:I want to see what word do you have to say about the situation,5
teacher:Whats happening in this graph,5
teacher:So what Id like you to tell me is for each figure number how many squares are in it,5
teacher:Okay so as the figure number goes up by one whats happening to the number of squares,5
teacher:Which one is bigger,5
teacher:Which one is getting more water added to  it,5
teacher:What else you guys thinking,5
teacher:Whats up,5
teacher:So how do we know its going to be the same amount per individual ticket,5
teacher:12 divided by three is four so 120 divided by three would be 40 and then crew what is 21 divided by three,5
teacher:Which one of these do you think has a more orangey flavor,5
teacher:What do you guys think,5
teacher:Frances what are the two things we are comparing,5
teacher:Orange juice and what else;student:Orange juice and,5
teacher:Darby help me fill out the very first column there,5
teacher:Maybe not so sneakily but it is important to get really good at graphing Alright Im seeing some awesome graphs what would be the point for x equals zero,5
teacher:What should I say for Lynn,5
teacher:Titan help me fill in the first column here,5
teacher:Who has a proposal for what we can do to compare these two recipes,5
teacher:So in this first situation what should we divide by,5
teacher:Crew everybody what are we going to divide by,5
teacher:Thanks for your help which would be one and then crew what is five divided by four;student:Four,5
teacher:Thatcher what did you just realize;student:You guys are all wrong,5
teacher:What are your thoughts,5
teacher:How much orange juice and how much soda water,5
teacher:And maybe you can tell me what you did,5
teacher:So notice how I wrote that out number of squares s in the ninth figure n number of squares in the ninth figure n so what are we going to replace here,5
teacher:s or  n in the equation,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:What does that look like on a graph,5
teacher:What are the intercepts of this equation or of this graph,5
teacher:What are the intercepts,5
teacher:And one of the most important things you can do is think about Just think about every time you move by one for x whats happening for y,5
teacher:And also think about is your slope going to be positive or negative,5
teacher:But think about is your slope positive or negative,5
teacher:And then think about how are you going to compare the rise and the run,5
teacher:the rise and the run,5
teacher:So whats the rise between these points,5
teacher:And what Id like to see everybody write in is whats the slope,5
teacher:Whats the y intercept on this graph,5
teacher:Whats the slope,5
teacher:Whats the y intercept,5
teacher:So I want you to think about what what does this mean,5
teacher:Like if youre walking on the sidewalk or something and theres no slope Or the slope is zero,5
teacher:So I want you to think about what does it mean for something to not have a slope,5
teacher:Whats your y intercept,5
teacher:Or what is your x intercept,5
teacher:Anybody have a suggestion,5
teacher:Should I be putting nine in for s or for n,5
teacher:So How big can my figure be,5
teacher:Or what figure number would i would be would I be able to make,5
teacher:Okay so what kind of equation do we have here,5
teacher:So how do we solve it,5
teacher:And if yes what is the equation,5
teacher:Were going to replace here,5
teacher:And really figure out like how do we find slope,5
teacher:How do you set up your equations all the time,5
teacher:And then if yes what is the equation,5
teacher:Alright so how about this one,5
teacher:how much does it go down by every time,5
teacher:and what does it start at,5
teacher:And then you need to think about where did you start,5
teacher:Alright so what are your x intercept,5
teacher:How do we find y intercepts,5
teacher:So earlier Gwen said same rate would mean;student:Its like theyre the same amount,5
teacher:Okay so Katie What do you think,5
teacher:What did we do on the last slide that looked like this,5
teacher:What do I need to do,5
teacher:Whats the whats the easiest equation We can write this,5
teacher:someone online Whats the whats the simplest equation that we can write from this with the fewest amount of letters and numbers,5
teacher:And its somewhere in here Give me another equation,5
teacher:Whats another one we can do,5
teacher:Okay should I solve for x or should I solve for y,5
teacher:What do we need to do now,5
teacher:And someone gave me one equation for the elimination That equals 180,5
teacher:Okay someone online Whats another equation that we could write that adds up to 180,5
teacher:Now what anybody have a suggestion what should we How are we going to find x,5
teacher:And which one you think would be easier,5
teacher:Which of these Mia Do you think youd pick,5
teacher:The red or the blue,5
teacher:Whats our last step,5
teacher:What kind of angles,5
teacher:And what do I need to do now to solve,5
teacher:I want to hear what kind of angles,5
teacher:All right what do we think is is this equation or this equation gonna be easier to use,5
teacher:And does anybody see another one that we can write,5
teacher:And Can someone tell us whats the measure of this entire angle that I drew,5
teacher:in green,5
teacher:What are these add up to here,5
teacher:Whats the first whats the first thing that would be easy to figure out X Y or Z,5
teacher:Okay how can I figure out extra z,5
teacher:Whats Z,5
teacher:And its gonna wait a couple seconds give people a chance to think about whats the first thing they can figure out and number two,5
teacher:Someone online Can you unmute and tell me What would be the first thing that you notice in this diagram,5
teacher:Christian what about the 47,5
teacher:And so like Christian what would be your The first thing that you would do to solve this problem,5
teacher:Okay so what we do now,5
teacher:Whats uh anybody have an equation that we can write,5
teacher:Like do we need to do substitution or elimination,5
teacher:whats one equation we could write from this from this diagram,5
teacher:Okay someone online Whats another equation that we could write,5
teacher:Whats y,5
teacher:What kind of angles to these make,5
teacher:And what do we know about alternate interior angles,5
teacher:whats our first step here,5
teacher:This angle and this angle,5
teacher:And whats our equation going to be then,5
teacher:All right what should I do with my answer,5
teacher:Okay anybody have a suggestion on this one,5
teacher:What do you think Ian;student:Yeah,5
teacher:So corresponding angles and Im going to write then what kind of whats the word for this Ian,5
teacher:when they combine like this,5
teacher:Last step in our notes what are going to need to do,5
teacher:how do I get rid of this;student:Im not sure if thats right But,5
teacher:Someone in here What is congruent,5
teacher:Whats another word we can use,5
teacher:Which letter matches up with B and the other one,5
teacher:Okay how about I what if I match up with,5
teacher:So b i what side does that match up with on the other one,5
teacher:Someone online Can you give me the next pair of sides that are equal,5
teacher:Do we know anything about these angles,5
teacher:What do we know about those,5
teacher:Should we take away x or take away 3x,5
teacher:So corresponding and Ivan what uh what do we know about corresponding angles,5
teacher:could be anybody What kind of angles are these,5
teacher:And Patrick what kind of or what do we know about corresponding angles,5
teacher:what are we;student:Oh um,5
teacher:What are these angles mean,5
teacher:What like how can we compare these,5
teacher:What kind of angles are these,5
teacher:So instead of the same what are they,5
teacher:Anybody else have an idea,5
teacher:And as a Final answer What do we get,5
teacher:What kind of angles are these,5
teacher:And what do we know about samesite,5
teacher:And thats one ad to show everybody that way to remember supplementary and complementary with,5
teacher:What do we do last to finish off this problem,5
teacher:What is the other angle has to be 20 with the 103,5
teacher:Are you the same three steps what angle relationship,5
teacher:Okay what are those two highlighted parts Ivan,5
teacher:x equals,5
teacher:starts with an R Anyone Remember that,5
teacher:Does anybody remember what this angle is called,5
teacher:So what if we have an angle like this,5
teacher:What is negative nine sixths equal to,5
teacher:What is negative three minus six,5
teacher:So thats what I wants to focus on on this one is what happens when the equation doesnt have a plus or minus after it,5
teacher:So y equals 2x plus zero how does that change your mind about what youre working on,5
teacher:If I told you this was the same equation as this,5
teacher:How does that change your mind,5
teacher:Now what does this look like in the table,5
teacher:So y equals 2x minus five what is the slope,5
teacher:Whats the y intercept,5
teacher:Okay the goal of these next couple questions is is to really start to figure out like how can we quickly figure out the slope and y intercept from an equation or from a graph or from a table,5
teacher:And just like right away know what were talking about,5
teacher:So Jeremiah can you tell me what would be your first step to solve this equation,5
teacher:And Andrea what would be your next step here,5
teacher:All right Chris what do you think we need to do next to complete this problem,5
teacher:So what do I need to do to find those distances,5
teacher:Okay and then what about when we simplify this,5
teacher:Close What are these both divisible by;student:Is it half of nine,5
teacher:Maybe you can unmute and say what is this simplify to as a fraction,5
teacher:What is this simplify to,5
teacher:What was the first thing we did,5
teacher:And I think its really helpful to label because then you dont get mixed up you always do y two minus y 1 x two minus x one you dont even like theres no other part to it you just have to think about what numbers match up and where do you put them in the equation,5
teacher:And todays a really important day of kind of putting everything together that weve been working on slope y intercept equations how do those all connect,5
teacher:How do those all look,5
teacher:How can we find slope and y intercept from all those different things,5
teacher:Okay so I want you to think to yourself right now what are the two things we need,5
teacher:What are those two things,5
teacher:Okay so any without doing any adding or subtracting or multiplying can you tell me what is qR,5
teacher:What are those two things that we need in our equation,5
teacher:But whats the first thing that we did yesterday,5
teacher:On a question like this,5
teacher:What did we label first,5
teacher:Hey whats the first thing that we did yesterday,5
teacher:Can anybody help us out,5
teacher:What did I label underneath these coordinates,5
teacher:Okay now is it was anybody able to simplify this,5
teacher:What are the two things we need in our equation,5
teacher:Okay so can someone remind me whats our first step,5
teacher:What do we know about these two segments;student:Would it be,5
teacher:Austin what would you suggest,5
teacher:Number two Amara Can you give me four co planar points,5
teacher:Can you pick a different one to replace it,5
teacher:Can you just replace a with a different one,5
teacher:and Lila can you give me a different four points Thatd be coplanar,5
teacher:Okay um Brad can you give me two lines please,5
teacher:And what was your second one Brad,5
teacher:If you put that one down if anyone put that one down okay and then um Lila how about one line that is not drawn,5
teacher:And Ryan what do you notice about these two ways of naming it,5
teacher:Whats the same about both of these,5
teacher:the letters in the angle and whats like exactly the same in the same exact spot in both of them;student:um the letters in the angle,5
teacher:And then whats another way that you can name that angle,5
teacher:Whats one way that you name this angle,5
teacher:And Lily whats another way that you could name this,5
teacher:Whats another way that you could name this,5
teacher:And then Angelina whats another way that you could name this angle,5
teacher:Eliza Do you have another set of three collinear points,5
teacher:Camila Can you give me your answer to number one three collinear points,5
teacher:So my question was a little bit tricky I think because of the way I said it but if AB is already built then what is this gonna be a positive and negative number over here,5
teacher:So if this is 42 now um and lets see I think Tristan was next what kind of number is going to be bc if this ones 42,5
teacher:How would we solve a problem that looks like this,5
teacher:Whats our goal here,5
teacher:And Ethan can you give me some factors of 12,5
teacher:Can you think of another two factors of 12,5
teacher:Harley I think we left off there Harley Harley any ideas,5
teacher:How are we going to solve this equation over here on the left,5
teacher:Harley how were gonna solve this equation over here to the left,5
teacher:Okay and Fernando can you tell me what would PR be then if we know each parts 41,5
teacher:Okay Diana how are we gonna solve this one On the left,5
teacher:Im going to highlight a couple things for you Diane and then you can tell me what would you do with these two parts that Im highlighting,5
teacher:Okay now Patrick what do you think Um what do you think we need to do next if we want to set it equal to zero,5
teacher:Oh how would we get rid of this part;student:Um not sure,5
teacher:Other Patrick Patrick Garcia Lopez what are some factors of negative 28,5
teacher:Okay so whats another factor pair for negative 28,5
teacher:How about with four;student:I dont know,5
teacher:Four times whats gonna get us 28,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Joyce what does this information mean,5
teacher:So if thats the case what does this information mean,5
teacher:So what is your proposal to figure out if they have the same rate,5
teacher:Okay and whats that going to give me when I divide,5
teacher:Why dont you have a look at whats left over here and see if you can tell me what fraction of our next group of our piece is,5
teacher:What do you guys think,5
teacher:I would love to hear some thoughts,5
teacher:Brooks what do you think,5
teacher:what do you think,5
teacher:Brennan what do you think;student:Agree,5
teacher:Rylan what do you think,5
teacher:One and 34 or just 34,5
teacher:What do you think;student:Can I share ideas or no,5
teacher:Do you have a proposal for an answer,5
teacher:Caelen what are you thinking,5
teacher:Sawyer what are you thinking;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Rylan what are you thinking,5
teacher:Can you get us started with this one,5
teacher:When you say the two what are the two you would like me to divide,5
teacher:What would that be,5
teacher:Celeste what should I do next;student:46,5
teacher:Rylan what should I do first,5
teacher:It says how many threefourths are in two,5
teacher:How many threefourths are in two,5
teacher:How many threefourths or how many groups of threefourths are in two,5
teacher:How much is my left over piece,5
teacher:What do you think Allaya,5
teacher:Whats it going to be crew,5
teacher:what should we do first,5
teacher:Okay  between two and eight what is our common denominator,5
teacher:What do you think it could be,5
teacher:what are we going to do next,5
teacher:Who would like to explain how we got from our mixed numbers to an improper fraction;student:Where did you get 288,5
teacher:whats our next step,5
teacher:can you finish this off,5
teacher:Can you help us write this as a mixed number,5
teacher:do you want to share your idea,5
teacher:What will that give me;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Okay and what would that be;student:Put that two and 13,5
teacher:Wait two and 13 how would we write that as an improper fraction;student:Then you do 11 as,5
teacher:Carmon what are we going to do next,5
teacher:Can you guys think of two strategies that you can use to be able to divide a whole number by a fraction,5
teacher:What were you thinking,5
teacher:what do you think,5
teacher:what do you think,5
teacher:Are there any other proposals for what you think our remainder might be,5
teacher:What is my division sentence for this one,5
teacher:How does that change your sentence,5
teacher:What would your number sentence be;student:Okay,5
teacher:What are the size of the pieces were going to divide it into,5
teacher:tell us what were going to do next to solve this,5
teacher:Whats an algorithm we can use,5
teacher:What could our common denominator be Sophie,5
teacher:Between one and five what could our common denominator be,5
teacher:Whats our division sentence going to be,5
teacher:What should we do,5
teacher:What do you do,5
teacher:Colette S what did you write for work C,5
teacher:What is the strategy you like to use to divide a fraction by a fraction,5
teacher:What was the strategy you take,5
teacher:What should we do for our next step,5
teacher:Divide what;student:Divide,5
teacher:What are we going to do now,5
teacher:What would our final answer be,5
teacher:Samson what would our final answer be,5
teacher:What would our final answer be,5
teacher:Sawyer what would our from this last problem here about Tom what would our number sentence be;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Briella do you want to explain it,5
teacher:Brooks whats a common denominator between four and eight,5
teacher:Whats an equivalent fraction,5
teacher:If we multiply the numerator and the denominator by two whats an equivalent fraction,5
teacher:What would our final answer be Royce,5
teacher:Six what;student:Six,5
teacher:What now,5
teacher:Tell me what you would do if you were to divide a fraction by a fraction,5
teacher:What would you do,5
teacher:34 whats it going to become,5
teacher:So youd rather do five divided by what Allaya,5
teacher:This one says how many threehalves are in five,5
teacher:Do you want to explain it;student:Well its kind of hard to explain but I agree,5
teacher:Yeah what would that be;student:Oh yeah so wouldnt we just do 5x40,5
teacher:And what would that be;student:30x2,5
teacher:Im going to let you tackle this Santiago which is this last column which 2 numbers are we going to multiply for the area here,5
teacher:Yeah whats 5x2;student:5x2,5
teacher:It gets tricky when we start thinking what does it actually mean,5
teacher:Santiago where would you like to start on this problem,5
teacher:4x5 and what would that be;student:4x5,5
teacher:4x5 is,5
teacher:And what would that be;student:3x4 times 23,5
teacher:All right how did you get to 12 so quickly,5
teacher:Okay tell me what I should do to solve that problem;student:I guess 5 times 24,5
teacher:Okay Miles you are our next person Miles what should I do next,5
teacher:Santiago P what should we do next,5
teacher:Crew what would a common denominator be between 3 and 4 and 2,5
teacher:Landon what do you think,5
teacher:Colton which one would you like to do next,5
teacher:In order to get 30x40 what would that be,5
teacher:Or first I should say,5
teacher:Okay Nathan what should we do next,5
teacher:Okay keep going,5
teacher:So were going to say well how many times does four go into 13,5
teacher:How many times can we count by four to get to 13,5
teacher:Whats a common multiple of eight and 12 and I want the least common multiple,5
teacher:Were going to add that to what would we multiply 12 by to get to 24,5
teacher:Theodore what do you think,5
teacher:What would that be crew,5
teacher:How should we start solving this problem Nicole,5
teacher:And then lets add our fractions together and what would we get,5
teacher:Tell me what Im going to do to be able to solve this 4x27 multiplication problem with an area model,5
teacher:What should I do first,5
teacher:You may ask a question or tell me what to do next,5
teacher:Okay and what did you get;student:Then I did 4x7,5
teacher:I dont see NicoleWhats our last step Josiah,5
teacher:And what would we get;student:We need to add the numbers together,5
teacher:Cool all right lets go to the second one 35x42 what should we do first Shayla,5
teacher:Which box would you like to start with,5
teacher:Yeah you have 27 divided by four so that means,5
teacher:Trinity what do you think we should do first,5
teacher:Yeah can you help me solve this one;student:56 times 34,5
teacher:Um McKenna what do you think,5
teacher:How many times does twothirds fit into one whole,5
teacher:So Remy what do you think,5
teacher:Remy can you explain where you got one and a half from,5
teacher:Because were puttingwere saying how many times does twothirds go into one whole;student:If were dividing one divided by twothirds how did we get something bigger than one,5
teacher:How many times does the size of your group fit into your whole,5
teacher:I hope I didnt zoom in too much here how many threefourths are in one whole,5
teacher:So how many threefourths are in one whole,5
teacher:We need to look at this left over piece and see what fraction of the part it is,5
teacher:Lilith what do you think,5
teacher:What fraction of the part is that,5
teacher:Howd you get that too;student:Oh because I was kind of just what I got too I guess,5
teacher:And this one says how many twothirds are in three,5
teacher:How many twothirds are in three,5
teacher:We want to know how many times this piecelike we want to know this piece what fraction of a part is it,5
teacher:Kendall what are you thinking,5
teacher:Allen how many times do you think that twothirds fits into one whole,5
teacher:How many times do you think that the fraction twothirds fits into one whole,5
teacher:Make sure to also put that sentence how many twothirds are in one,5
teacher:What should I do first;student:Sure,5
teacher:What is a common denominator between 6 and 24,5
teacher:Rene what do you think it is,5
teacher:So if we start with the question How many groups of two and a half are in 10,5
teacher:So how many groups of two and a half were you able to fit into 10,5
teacher:What did you figure out,5
teacher:How many times will two and a half go into 10,5
teacher:Leilani what should we do next,5
teacher:So how many groups of two are in seven,5
teacher:In our number sentence Adeline what does two represent,5
teacher:How are we going to interpret that piece thats left over,5
teacher:Briella what do you think,5
teacher:Our question said How many groups of two,5
teacher:So this says How many times does twothirds fit into one whole,5
teacher:How many twothirds are in one,5
teacher:One divided by twothirds and then how many twothirds are in one,5
teacher:Lucas P what part of our number sentence when we have seven what does seven represent,5
teacher:How many times does four go into 27,5
teacher:With what left over;student:Six times,5
teacher:So your very first problem says How do you think about division,5
teacher:And then what did you do,5
teacher:Yeah tell us your strategy;student:Well I think I counted wrong so I dont think I have the right answer but I do know how to do it,5
teacher:Okay and whatd you get for those two;student:So what I counted is I counted the left column and the top row and then I multiplied those by each other,5
teacher:So what two numbers did you multiply;student:Well I got 48,5
teacher:So whats 48 divided by two,5
teacher:Can you guys give me a synonym to the word equivalent,5
teacher:How much soup do we need,5
teacher:How much cheese do we need to get Allie,5
teacher:What am I going to say for pasta,5
teacher:What kind of diagrams have we been using to compare ratios,5
teacher:What kind of diagrams have we been using as weve been studying ratios,5
teacher:Clayton what do you think,5
teacher:Under question number one in that space in your packet it says   What is the same about their workouts,5
teacher:What is different about their workouts,5
teacher:Dakota do you want to share something that is the same or something that is different,5
teacher:Who would like to share what they saw and how they saw it,5
teacher:Emerson do you want to read yours,5
teacher:How do you know when two ratios are equivalent,5
teacher:How do you know when two ratios are equivalent,5
teacher:Tanner how much cheese do I need,5
teacher:If I have one but I only need one fifth of that amount what am I going to do;student:What we need five,5
teacher:Yeah whats one divided by five;student:Divide by five,5
teacher:Do you know how much pasta were going to need,5
teacher:What do we call that;student:Second one is two and two,5
teacher:This next one says what is the ratio of cups of pasta to ounces of tuna in on batch of casserole,5
teacher:How much pasta,5
teacher:What is their distance,5
teacher:What would we say Estella for every three cups of pasta there is,5
teacher:On our next problem this says how many batches of casserole would you make if you used the following amounts of ingredients,5
teacher:How many batches can I make,5
teacher:What would I multiply by in order to get that equivalent ratio,5
teacher:What would I multiply by;student:Three,5
teacher:What can I multiply by to get to nine and 18,5
teacher:Tanner what do you think,5
teacher:How do you know when to ratios are equivalent,5
teacher:Yeah how would you simplify it;student:But didnt you simplify it,5
teacher:How did you get two;student:Two,5
teacher:Esther do you want to share something that is the same or something that is different,5
teacher:So Denver who burned more calories,5
teacher:What on our ratio table will help us support that Dallas is the faster runner,5
teacher:Giselle can you read your statement,5
teacher:Tyson can you read yours,5
teacher:Who would like to share what same rate means,5
teacher:Van what does same rate mean,5
teacher:Gwen what does that mean,5
teacher:Westin what is some important information about Diego that we should pay attention to,5
teacher:So how much did he pay,5
teacher:For how many tickets,5
teacher:Hannah what is the important information we should pay attention to for Andre,5
teacher:Eden what are the two things that we are comparing for Diego,5
teacher:Mmhmm  and what else;student:Price,5
teacher:Price  or money and tickets and what was the price Eden,5
teacher:For how many tickets;student:For Diego its 47,5
teacher:Once again we are going to  compare money and tickets and Jolene what is our information we need to include there,5
teacher:So when you look at this Denver who is the faster runner,5
teacher:Then Delta what are we going to have,5
teacher:Tell me exactly what we should do on Jadas,5
teacher:Delta do you have a proposal,5
teacher:Yeah and what was her number again;student:Dallas,5
teacher:Do you know what it is Frances,5
teacher:Do you guys know what those two numbers mean,5
teacher:Neal do you know what;student:Heart rate,5
teacher:Do you know what those numbers mean,5
teacher:Tell  me more;student:Maybe pace,5
teacher:Tell me more;student:Like how fast theyre going,5
teacher:Denver what is something that you noticed that was the same or different,5
teacher:Does anybody know what distance is measured in,5
teacher:What unit are they using to measure time,5
teacher:What do you think Thatcher;student:An hour,5
