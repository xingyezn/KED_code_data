teacher:Why wouldnt it be okay,0
teacher:Why do we estimate,0
teacher:Sean why do we estimate,0
teacher:But why,0
teacher:Why was it two,0
teacher:But why;student:Multiplied two times six and I got 12,0
teacher:Why did you also do it on the bottom,0
teacher:Now why does that make sense,0
teacher:And why you think its true;student:Its true,0
teacher:It is why,0
teacher:Is there anyone who can explain why they think its true,0
teacher:Who havent I heard from Emiliano what do you think,0
teacher:So why are they not the same,0
teacher:Why am I keep saying this,0
teacher:Even if you are Miss Gaby and Miss Tati and Miss Delilah and Mr Emiliano or the others that know that one half is equal to zero and five tenths the question is why,0
teacher:Why do you think this is equal to this,0
teacher:How come we dont do the same thing we did with the third to the fourth,0
teacher:Why can we not tell for sure the way its written,0
teacher:Why can we not tell the way it is that we should not be able to know the answer the way it is written right now why not,0
teacher:Why do we find a common denominator,0
teacher:Why do we have to find a common denominator turn it into 96 pieces;student:Um,0
teacher:Why cant we compare them,0
teacher:What did she say why we could not compare them originally Noah,0
teacher:So Mr Max why do we find a common denominator,0
teacher:Who can tell me why we estimate first,0
teacher:Why  estimation,0
teacher:Hunter can you explain your thinking for this one please,0
teacher:38 and how did we know it was 38;student:38,0
teacher:Sandra why,0
teacher:Rogelio why are you saying false,0
teacher:Wait why did you change this to a three,0
teacher:44 why;student:44 34 24 and all the way to 1,0
teacher:Karen why do you think its going to be greater,0
teacher:Kayla can you explain the rule why we know its going to be less than 78,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:How do we know that 14  24 is greater than 12,0
teacher:Rita explain how you knew,0
teacher:Who wants to share their thinking,0
teacher:Eliza show your thinking please;student:Yes,0
teacher:Ay yay yay Hunter why do we want to find a common denominator;student:Becuase you want to know what the warm up was about,0
teacher:38 and how did we know it was 38;student:38,0
teacher:Why  estimation,0
teacher:Who can tell me why we estimate first,0
teacher:Why do we estimate,0
teacher:Drew why do we estimate,0
teacher:Why else is it important to show your work,0
teacher:Explain your thinking,0
teacher:Why does he measure on the bottom,0
teacher:Is there any information from your graph that can help you think that;student:Okay so  I think its 12 inches because first of all in this video it says they get to 12 inches and then second of all they look 12 inches because they look like the size of a ruler,0
teacher:How do you know from this graph,0
teacher:why do that,0
teacher:Why do we multiply,0
teacher:Blake can you explain your thinking for this one please,0
teacher:Kathleen,0
teacher:Rule number two that were working on today which is what were doing right here is whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top but why,0
teacher:Why do we have to do that,0
teacher:Why shouldnt we just do what I did which is multiply them together,0
teacher:Why;student:Yes,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Visually we saw that it worked but mathematically why isnt it working,0
teacher:Mathematically why doesnt that work,0
teacher:Why cant I add these together,0
teacher:Why did you say there at the end whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top,0
teacher:Why not;student:No,0
teacher:Why doesnt our first one work,0
teacher:Talk as a table why doesnt our first one work now,0
teacher:AJ why can we not compare these two fractions the way they are,0
teacher:So why is this the right answer,0
teacher:Yes but why is this not the right answer;student:Yes,0
teacher:Why is this not the right answer,0
teacher:If this was pizza why does this not work,0
teacher:Why does it not work,0
teacher:Why doesnt it work,0
teacher:Why not;student:No,0
teacher:What is it and why,0
teacher:What you think it is and why,0
teacher:Why;student:Its hard,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Tell them why did you choose onefourth plus onefourth plus onefourth,0
teacher:Why is that okay,0
teacher:But why,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why whatever we do to the bottom do we have to do to the top,0
teacher:But why,0
teacher:Why is it twofourths Savannah,0
teacher:Why are we multiplying them both by eight,0
teacher:Why is it that for number one you can find the answer even without finding a common denominator Marie,0
teacher:Why can we do number one even though it does not have a common denominator,0
teacher:Why were using 24,0
teacher:Okay who can explain to Mr Jack why were using 24,0
teacher:Polly please tell Mr Jack why were using 24,0
teacher:Why does that work,0
teacher:Why does that work,0
teacher:Knowing the rule is great but you have to understand why is it a rule,0
teacher:Why does that work,0
teacher:Why does it work,0
teacher:But why does that work,0
teacher:Why Mr Parker that get us a common denominator,0
teacher:How come;student:So basically we multiply those two together eight times three and then you get 24,0
teacher:Who thinks they can explain why we did that,0
teacher:Why;student:So what you do was,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Can you explain why multiplying our two denominators works,0
teacher:But why;student:Because you can always multiply,0
teacher:Youre right guys this is this is the most important part of the math learning today is why,0
teacher:Please tell us how you knew 48 would work,0
teacher:Why does multiplying your denominators together work,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why;student:I think its false,0
teacher:112 why did you say a twelfth;student:You just shaded in 112,0
teacher:Because;student:24,0
teacher:Touch your shoulder partner dont do anything and just explain what you think the answer is and why,0
teacher:10 and how do you know;student:10,0
teacher:Why do Ms Gibsons look like concise answers,0
teacher:Why did we call them relational symbol,0
teacher:Nivea how do you know its equal;student:Can I have the marker,0
teacher:Roberto how did you know that it is less than,0
teacher:Hudson tell me why the answer is less than,0
teacher:It less than because,0
teacher:Anytime you,0
teacher:When you;student:When you,0
teacher:Why do you use multiplication in area,0
teacher:How do you know;student:Multiplication,0
teacher:No its not even greater than nine how do you know,0
teacher:Lisa why do I have people share their strategies,0
teacher:Why do you suppose,0
teacher:Tera why do I have people share their strategies,0
teacher:How do we know that the decimal in the first problem is correct,0
teacher:How do we know the decimal in the first problem is correct,0
teacher:Okay do you see why we did this,0
teacher:Why thats 10 to the first and times 10 squared,0
teacher:Can you tell us what youre doing and why,0
teacher:Why even do the math problem if we dont understand what its tell us,0
teacher:How do you know;student:That would be 40,0
teacher:0059 and how did you know;student:The answer is 0059,0
teacher:Franc what was your answer and why did you get that,0
teacher:Can somebody explain why it would just be six,0
teacher:Then could someone help us out why is this problem more challenging than the first problem,0
teacher:Melvin why is this one more challenging;student:Because its easy,0
teacher:Tobias why are these more tricky,0
teacher:In this case for example I would ask Missy why do you think your answer is correct,0
teacher:Missy needs to tell the group why she thinks that her answer is correct,0
teacher:Okay so just because I dont want to spend a lot more time on it can I get somebody else to explain what your consensus was and why,0
teacher:Okay and why;student:Our consensus was zero,0
teacher:Why are you changing directions,0
teacher:Abby you think it is less than why do you think so,0
teacher:Mika why did you know the answer is yes,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:If she uses her rule what do you think the new trapezoid will look like and why,0
teacher:How could you prove that,0
teacher:Was there a reason why you started with a bigger number,0
teacher:They use two grids because why,0
teacher:Last year I know that in fourth grade you got asked a lot why would you do an estimate or how do you know that your number made sense,0
teacher:Why do you do an estimate,0
teacher:Why would I throw that in now,0
teacher:Why six times eight,0
teacher:Why do I make these connections for why am I helping you make connections,0
teacher:Why is that importantFranc,0
teacher:Why do you have to explain,0
teacher:For your T why do I want you to use a model;student:To show others how to do it,0
teacher:I know but how could you prove it using the picture;student:Ones wider and ones,0
teacher:How do you know;student:Three,0
teacher:Why are you on the no side,0
teacher:If we dont know what it means then why even do the problem,0
teacher:Why are we cheering to keep saving,0
teacher:Why are we cheering for every time we save,0
teacher:Why is it important to save money Alexander;student:The more you spend when you do have to pay bills you wont have money to do it,0
teacher:I want you to think about before we move on and go through A B C and D which one of these was the hardest to answer and why,0
teacher:Cassandra which one do you think was the hardest to answer and why,0
teacher:How do you know five is greater,0
teacher:How do we know that this is greater,0
teacher:Why is five greater,0
teacher:Why do you say less,0
teacher:Now why because I see a fraction,0
teacher:How do you know  in Part B  equivalent to four fives,0
teacher:So how do you know these are all equal to four fifths,0
teacher:Why would I want you to draw,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why;student:What I did was I took 3 4 and I multiply it by 3,0
teacher:82 why,0
teacher:Why;student:No,0
teacher:Why Francis,0
teacher:Why cant I subtract,0
teacher:Why plus 6;student:Now you add on You do 2  6,0
teacher:Which problem was the toughest and why,0
teacher:Why did you make it into 68;student:What I did is I made it I guess since it was 34 and so I made it into 68,0
teacher:26 how do you know;student:26,0
teacher:Do you notice how we are wanting to save more than were wanting to spend now why would that be,0
teacher:I know its 8751 but lets say I mix up the decimal point why is it so important Kelly,0
teacher:Why is it so important that I am exactly right on my decimal point,0
teacher:Why is the decimal so important where I put it,0
teacher:Why;student:I think yes its greater than,0
teacher:Why is it yes,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Yes why;student:That will be zero,0
teacher:Why 104;student:104,0
teacher:Why;student:You would need to drag D to 100,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:And why wider Allen,0
teacher:What does that mean I fill in and why,0
teacher:Why did that make you come over here;student:Because it says five ones then three and seven and on the graph it shows 7 3,0
teacher:Why;student:No,0
teacher:Aria why do you say no;student:No,0
teacher:Why do we have to be so specific about where we put the and;student:And is for the decimal,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why;student:Yes,0
teacher:Henry can you explain,0
teacher:Efficient why do we want to be efficient Stella,0
teacher:If we have a lot of problems to solve why would we want to be efficient Missy,0
teacher:Why should 20 be on top Zoey,0
teacher:Why would it be important to know how much change youre supposed to get back,0
teacher:Why is that important Bander,0
teacher:Why is the decimal so important,0
teacher:Naomi why,0
teacher:The last thing Id like to work on is this the last question it says based on your results above who do you think is the best surfer why;student:Because you dont have to go you dont have to stand all the way,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Because,0
teacher:Why do you think that so many kids rhere were probably five kids showed this work on their exit ticket,0
teacher:Jeremiah why do you think so many kids showed that work on their exit ticket,0
teacher:You might not know the best way to solve it yet but I want you to think about the problem and draw a picture to represent what the questions asking you to How can you use a picture to help visualize what this question is asking,0
teacher:Tell me why you think that,0
teacher:Yes Eileen tell me why in this problem we cut the bar into fives;student:Because 5 x 7 is 35,0
teacher:I just want to hear why you think so,0
teacher:Why not yet;student:Not fully,0
teacher:Why;student:Four,0
teacher:Or by 6 so why fourths in this particular problem;student:Or 6,0
teacher:Whyd you split it into three,0
teacher:Tell me about why your boxes are blank;student:I dont know,0
teacher:Why not;student:No,0
teacher:Paula whyd she put 23 in the boxes;student:Not me,0
teacher:Anybody give that one a shot Sophia,0
teacher:Somebody else want to give Jeremiah an explanation why those two pieces when we put them together equals two out of two,0
teacher:Why this one and not this one,0
teacher:Why two thirds why does two thirds work James,0
teacher:Three fourths because I ate;student:Three fourths,0
teacher:I have one pizza that Im going to share with three people Im going to cut that pizza into three slices and everybody gets one bite what if they chopped up that pizza for me already and they gave us six slices still three people but now Im going to share six slices how do I know how many slices each persons gonna get,0
teacher:Somebody tell me why,0
teacher:Why 13,0
teacher:Why would I multiply it,0
teacher:Why would I multiply,0
teacher:Why cant you subtract 20 from 18;student:You cant subtract 20 from 18,0
teacher:Why do you think,0
teacher:What is the mistake in this problem and why is it my favorite,0
teacher:Why do you say taller;student:Taller,0
teacher:Why;student:assignment made,0
teacher:So why would I divide 240 by 6,0
teacher:Yes why,0
teacher:Around 80 Why is that reasonable;student:Maybe like around 80,0
teacher:Why would we do that;student:Would you add another set of,0
teacher:400 so our goal is to get to 100 spectators why is it useful to pretend say well if this is the ratio then I want to pretend that I have a hundred spectators to see why is that useful,0
teacher:Why is it going to 100 useful,0
teacher:Why dont you do that,0
teacher:Why did that not seem reasonable,0
teacher:Why would you not just use it,0
teacher:Why does an architect of a gingerbread house need to consider the area,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why not,0
teacher:Yes why not,0
teacher:Which would you choose to measure the volume of the house and why,0
teacher:Why Smarties,0
teacher:What unit would you choose and why Adrian,0
teacher:Why do you think that is,0
teacher:Daniel why do you think that might be,0
teacher:How do you know,0
teacher:Why do you think it will be double,0
teacher:What do you know What about your math background knowledge makes you think itll look like a yacht,0
teacher:How do you know its two times bigger,0
teacher:How do you know it was two times wider,0
teacher:Why not;student:No,0
teacher:5x3 why did you pick 5x3,0
teacher:Somebody explain this to me,0
teacher:Okay what is our smallest fraction and why,0
teacher:Why Jaher,0
teacher:Why did you make six;student:I made six,0
teacher:Why did I put the fraction 18,0
teacher:Everett why did I put the fraction oneeight,0
teacher:Okay why do you think its 610;student:I think its 610,0
teacher:Why are you doing the subtractions,0
teacher:Why not;student:No,0
teacher:Why did we have to start with the x coordinate,0
teacher:Why did you get up and grab a ruler;student:A ruler,0
teacher:Why is there not a dot on it;student:Right there,0
teacher:Why did you subtract 11 minus eight,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:Why;student:Yes,0
teacher:Why wont it be the right coordinates;student:Because its not the right coordinates,0
teacher:What are we talking about that would be different then,0
teacher:Those arent labeled X and Y coordinates so why is it going to mess me up;student:The X and Y are going to switch  because you have to start with the X and if you dont start with the right  your coordinate is going to be off by a lot,0
teacher:Explain to me why you did eight plus four,0
teacher:Finn why did you not fill it in,0
teacher:Why do you keep logging Y;student:X,0
teacher:Because;student:Seven,0
teacher:Lisa do you see why its one and four;student:Yes,0
teacher:Explain to me why its one and four,0
teacher:Why;student:Not really,0
teacher:Because;student:Yes,0
teacher:Okay how do you know;student:Yes,0
teacher:Why do you say times two,0
teacher:Why did you change this fraction,0
teacher:Why;student:110,0
teacher:Why;student:1920,0
teacher:Why is this so hard;student:Thats hard,0
teacher:Because;student:Yes,0
teacher:Why is this one bigger than this one;student:Second,0
teacher:110 why do you think 110;student:110,0
teacher:Why;student:Yes,0
teacher:Why do you say its 300,0
teacher:Why are you doing 1 x 2;student:First you have do 1 x 2,0
teacher:Because;student:At the bottom you do 4 x 2,0
teacher:Why do you think she multiplied by 32,0
teacher:Why is 110 the smallest,0
teacher:The question I was asking is what did we multiply by,0
teacher:I really want to know because theyre numbers up there and I added my numerators why dont I add my denominators,0
teacher:Why do you think it equals one whole;student:I think it equals one whole,0
teacher:Talk with your table right now about whether you think that is possible and why what are your reasons,0
teacher:Ali why do you say no,0
teacher:Why do you say that;student:Because the oldest daughter gets like half the land then the third daughter will get like a a third the other one will get 110 of the land,0
teacher:You multiplied it by 10 because,0
teacher:Why did you change that fraction,0
teacher:Why would you change 13,0
teacher:Why;student:You multiply your numerator and denominator,0
teacher:Why am I going to do that;student:So you can get,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Israel says I just need to add my numerators why dont I do anything to my denominators;student:Because if you add 3  2 is five and the denominators are the same so you just add 3  5  5 and 56,0
teacher:Im not saying whats in front of you is not equivalent to onehalf Im agreeing with all of you on that it is absolutely equivalent to onehalf but why is whats in front of you not onehalf,0
teacher:Why not,0
teacher:You might only want to start with a 100 its a friendly number but why dont we want to start with that one,0
teacher:Why;student:Twohalves equals one because,0
teacher:Mr Javier why is twohalves equal one whole,0
teacher:All right Mr Charles please stand up and tell the class why you think twohalves is equal to one,0
teacher:But why is two twos as youre calling it twohalves equal the one;student:One half plus one half is two twos because you dont add the denominator,0
teacher:Why is twohalves and not two twos,0
teacher:Talk about why and how you know it;student:Okay,0
teacher:Tell your table why Im wrong;student:No,0
teacher:Tell them why Im wrong,0
teacher:Why Im I wrong,0
teacher:So if Im wrong tell me why Im wrong,0
teacher:Do you know why Im wrong Nicole,0
teacher:Fiona do you know why Im wrong,0
teacher:Is there anybody who can come up here and be the Mr Parker and tell us why,0
teacher:Why not two halves and three thirds,0
teacher:Talk as a table why those wont work for this problem,0
teacher:Youre talking to your table about why it wont work,0
teacher:Why two halves and three thirds will not work as a great answer for that,0
teacher:Why can we not use three thirds and two halves in this problem talk,0
teacher:Why doesnt it work;student:How many times did this go into this,0
teacher:Thats  What do we think,0
teacher:why cant we just use two halves or three thirds,0
teacher:Why will two halves not work and three third wont work even though weve proven that they are both equal to one and our final answer is one because were equal in one of this guys,0
teacher:Why do you have to use this,0
teacher:Twohalves why does it equal one,0
teacher:Sienna why,0
teacher:Why does two halves equal one,0
teacher:Why is two halves the same things as one,0
teacher:Why;student:Yes,0
teacher:Why;student:Yes,0
teacher:Why do you think thats not a complete sentence,0
teacher:Why not;student:No,0
teacher:Youre saying no but why not,0
teacher:Why do you think I have not written a number sentence on the board,0
teacher:Why not,0
teacher:Youre saying no but why not,0
teacher:What do you think I have not written a number sentence on the board,0
teacher:Why not,0
teacher:Tell me why or why not;student:Yes,0
teacher:Why cant we use this,0
teacher:Why do you think its a complete sentence,0
teacher:You guys just said yes why do I think its complete sentence,0
teacher:Okay Corbin your hand was up why,0
teacher:Why do you think that is a complete sentence,0
teacher:Does anybody have when they were talking to their tablemates what they think is a good reason why it is since you all thought it was,0
teacher:Why you think it is a complete sentence,0
teacher:Ashley why do you think its a complete sentence,0
teacher:Come on talk about why,0
teacher:Why would I have us working together as a team on this,0
teacher:Whats the point of me saying I want you talking and working as a team Lucy,0
teacher:I want you to have is why,0
teacher:Why is two halves of two over two two out of two the same thing as one,0
teacher:But you have to tell me why;student:Its usually not,0
teacher:Why not,0
teacher:Or why can we use this,0
teacher:Why wont they work,0
teacher:Why am I not done with the problem,0
teacher:Roman why am I not done with the problem;student:Because you still,0
teacher:Why am I not done,0
teacher:Why am I not done with that problem yet,0
teacher:How do I know when Im done,0
teacher:How do I know when Im done,0
teacher:How do I know when I can stop,0
teacher:How do I know when this problem is done,0
teacher:Youre 100 right but why;student:You know when your problem is done is when a number is smaller than six like three is smaller than six,0
teacher:Why does that work,0
teacher:Thats perfect but why,0
teacher:Because what,0
teacher:So youre off to a good start but why,0
teacher:Why is the number six important in this,0
teacher:Jonah why is what Ms  said true,0
teacher:That as soon as we get a number thats smaller than six were done,0
teacher:How do we know when were done,0
teacher:Why;student:Yes,0
teacher:Will why are we subtracting 60 from 75,0
teacher:Why not;student:No,0
teacher:How do we know were done,0
teacher:Brielle how do we know were done,0
teacher:Why not a 100,0
teacher:Why is it not my best choice;student:What did you say,0
teacher:Why is it not my best choice,0
teacher:Why is it not my best choice,0
teacher:Why;student:No,0
teacher:Why do we want to get to those numbers;student:They wont work because we cant multiply anything to three to get two and we cant multiply anything to two to get three,0
teacher:Why;student:Youre going to make group of five in each row,0
teacher:Why did we choose the five,0
teacher:Why isnt it 7 338,0
teacher:Why did we choose to use the denominator instead of the numerator,0
teacher:Why multiple methods works and why when you do partial products you should always check your answers with division,0
teacher:Why are we starting with this,0
teacher:Why is the denominator important,0
teacher:Why one half;student:One half,0
teacher:So why,0
teacher:Why do we do that,0
teacher:Talk about it why cant you,0
teacher:Why do we break it into smaller parts,0
teacher:Why;student:Its a little bit easier to solve the problem,0
teacher:Now how do we know which one is which,0
teacher:Why cant we go over;student:Over,0
teacher:So why cant we use that one,0
teacher:Why cant we,0
teacher:why cant we use that,0
teacher:Jack why cant I do this,0
teacher:Zach why not,0
teacher:Why 6 times 10,0
teacher:Why do you think I think thats the best choice,0
teacher:Why do you think 6 times 10 is the best place to start your thinking box,0
teacher:When we do partial products why do we do it,0
teacher:Whos the better surfer and why right now,0
teacher:Why is 6 times 10 not the best choice to solve the problem,0
teacher:Whos the better surfer and why,0
teacher:Yeah why is that a six,0
teacher:Why did you put negative seven;student:Seven,0
teacher:How come youre not standing up to Raymond here and saying hey man look I got the right answers,0
teacher:So why did you plot down here when zero positive 12 is up there,0
teacher:Yes John why;student:Yes,0
teacher:Whyd I put these here,0
teacher:Why do you think that;student:N minus six,0
teacher:Tell me why,0
teacher:What do you think that graphs gonna look like;student:Sixteen,0
teacher:Why is it two A;student:So its two A squared,0
teacher:If you have A to the fourth up top why do we have A to the fourth on the bottom,0
teacher:Why is that,0
teacher:Why do you say 90 degrees;student:Ninety degrees,0
teacher:How can how do they justify that,0
teacher:Do you have something to back that up,0
teacher:Why do you think that ones easier,0
teacher:Why is that,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Who could  explain why,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why do you think she is doing that,0
teacher:Also what reasons you have for why your think so or why not,0
teacher:Michael why,0
teacher:Hey how come we didnt use your table,0
teacher:Numbers like that,0
teacher:Why didnt you pick like one and two and three,0
teacher:Why did you pick four and eight,0
teacher:Ricardo how can you see if an equation belongs with a descending line,0
teacher:But how can you tell that from the equation,0
teacher:Yes but why five;student:Uh Y equals five,0
teacher:How can you tell by looking at the table whether they are linear,0
teacher:Why should you take half of 12,0
teacher:Why 25;student:Twentyfive,0
teacher:But what why,0
teacher:No why squared;student:That is ten E squared,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why would I choose minus six and eight;student:Thirtysix,0
teacher:Why;student:I understand the equation but I dont know how to explain it,0
teacher:Could you write it underneath the number line and tell us why you would place it  there;student:We would place it here,0
teacher:Yes maybe you should write it as a fraction why three point;student:Then X equals minus three point three,0
teacher:Are you aware of why youre making arrowheads,0
teacher:Reason;student:that we know  and now we got,0
teacher:Why do you take the box,0
teacher:Why;student:Madam,0
teacher:Why;student:There now Ive found for half of X I will multiply by two to find X,0
teacher:So why do times a half;student:Times a half,0
teacher:No why do you do minus five X;student:E I understand very well,0
teacher:But why do you divide by four when you have an addition;student:the minus four the over four its also here,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:No Why do you want minus 21,0
teacher:How come you have your table backwards,0
teacher:Why not;student:Well cant I multi eh multiply that,0
teacher:A and D A and D How can you see that;student:Um A and D,0
teacher:And I would like to hear again  why that would work could you tell me Erin,0
teacher:Any idea,0
teacher:Why are you thinking equally likely Hafasta,0
teacher:Why do you think seven greens and three yellows Robert,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:can you   can you tell me why;student:Yeah,0
teacher:Why;student:In the middle of unlikely and impossible,0
teacher:Why do you have thirteen and seven,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:What makes you say that,0
teacher:Why twenty;student:Yeah,0
teacher:And why are you changing;student:Seven greens and three yellows,0
teacher:Who can tell me why you think we need to do some more drawing,0
teacher:Why six more,0
teacher:Can you tell me why,0
teacher:Do you see why;student:Yeah 4,0
teacher:Yeah why;student:I think I know why,0
teacher:The reason being;student:Four yeah,0
teacher:Why five;student:That would be I think that would be five,0
teacher:Ok so why s that;student:Six,0
teacher:Why are  you going to get four bows,0
teacher:Why acts as four;student:This acts as four,0
teacher:Why does this act as four;student:This,0
teacher:Why does this act as two;student:Well yeah this,0
teacher:Tell me why;student:Six,0
teacher:Okay why would you say twenty percent;student:I would say twenty percent,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why do you think it should go there,0
teacher:Why don t you think it would go between equally likely and likely,0
teacher:I am still confused now why one half is on the zero;student:This would be one and threequarters this would be one and fourquarters,0
teacher:And why two quarters is  between zero and one,0
teacher:Who  could explain why,0
teacher:David what do you think,0
teacher:Why not,0
teacher:Well Alan would argue I think maybe not that this is  one and this is the same length one inch and this is the  same length one inch so why cant we mark these all one;student:Its not the way to put  A ruler has the different numbers  that you count by so if you have all these 1s and you dont  have the numbers that they belong to then,0
teacher:And why do you think with the friend,0
teacher:You  Why;student:Robbie,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Can you tell me why 12 inches might be the perimeter,0
teacher:Tell me who you agree with and why,0
teacher:Why you would put it there and  not to the right or to the left,0
teacher:And how do you know;student:28,0
teacher:Now why do you think I gave her red,0
teacher:Why did I give her the color red,0
teacher:Why didnt I give her the green pen the green pen,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:And how come square inches;student:Instead of just regular inches,0
teacher:Okay how  why do you have to add the square inches;student:Hes thinking area is in square inches and like when you do perimeter you dont have square inches,0
teacher:Why do you have to tell people  inches squared,0
teacher:Or  square inches,0
teacher:Why is that important with area,0
teacher:And why;student:We were trying to figure out whether to put it on likely or equally likely,0
teacher:Why was that,0
teacher:Okay why;student:She put 4 rows and 7 columns,0
teacher:Can you prove it,0
teacher:Explain why,0
teacher:About it being exactly 2000 yen why did it become exactly 2000 yen here,0
teacher:Milin tell me  why,0
teacher:Can can you give me an argument you dont  have to do it why we jump from 4 to 8,0
teacher:But why 8;student:Two4then 8,0
teacher:So tell me now convince Jeff why its going to be 8   why  its going to be double;student:You could make 8,0
teacher:Why does  that sound like guessing,0
teacher:But Milin just said you dont have  all two blues and you said thats why is that,0
teacher:Why did you say 12 Michelle;student:Its its like its like,0
teacher:How come she got something she got 512,0
teacher:Why didnt the 8  work,0
teacher:Why did you have to keep,0
teacher:How could you jump  from towers of 6 to towers of 10 without going through all  those steps and why,0
teacher:But why;student:I agree,0
teacher:Do you know why they would have multiplied this one by by 2,0
teacher:Why do you think they went to 8 cups,0
teacher:So why did you pick thirtyfour,0
teacher:So why fourteen;student:That is twenty eight then just minus two is twenty six because that is the real one twentysix,0
teacher:Why twentysix;student:It will twentysix plus twentysix is twelve it s fiftytwo,0
teacher:Why do you think it was the two browns;student:Yeah it was the two browns I think,0
teacher:Why is it a red here and why is it a white here;student:Because two of em equal up to a red like the orange and the,0
teacher:Why not;student:Looking at this it would not be fiftieths,0
teacher:Ok tell me what youre showing up here uh Sarah and  Beth;student:I think its theyre right but one green and uh and a one I  think equals one purple because if you would put that to  that it would just equal one purple and put the,0
teacher:How do you know that that that theres not one smaller,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:But I dont can you explain to  me  why from 2 you get to 4,0
teacher:Why do you think 64;student:Probably 64,0
teacher:Okay why;student:Umm,0
teacher:Why one tenth,0
teacher:What do we think,0
teacher:Ok and can you tell us why your group feels good about that match;student:Situation 5 is  This test was very difficult for most people,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:Why or why not,0
teacher:Why is 0 important,0
teacher:Again why is 0 important,0
teacher:Could someone explain to us why you would be able to answer the prompt of when the three plans would cost the same if we could correct the confusion here with Online Flix,0
teacher:Why not;student:No changes,0
teacher:How did you think that,0
teacher:Why are they two fourths;student:Well this row and this row is a half   and then these are two fourths,0
teacher:I m hearing you say Brian that the number name for red is one sixth  and the reason why is;student:If you split one of these in half  and you have three of them up there they d make they d make six  and any way and when you split them in half right in the middle  over there it s kind of like that it s kind of like this there was this  was that was the one third  and that was the  one half  on the bottom and so it s just  like this and the red I m pretending is like is like is a half of one of  the purples and you see when I split it in half it s it s one sixth and  and it equals and it equals up to a green,0
teacher:Why wouldnt it be okay,0
teacher:Why not;student:Um no,0
teacher:David doesn t believe it why not David;student:No,0
teacher:Can you tell me why you  would give it the number name one third,0
teacher:Okay tell me why the number names change;student:Yes,0
teacher:Give me an example  of why the number names change,0
teacher:Why could the light green be a third and why could the red  be a third,0
teacher:Okay and why Michael one more time,0
teacher:Okay I heard someone say in the back of the room I was listening  someone asked a question someone said look we have three red  ones making the green one why cant we call the red one one;student:Because it would take three of the red ones to make um one of  the green ones,0
teacher:Do you want to tell me why you think so;student:Three wholes,0
teacher:Why four;student:Four,0
teacher:Why would you call it four,0
teacher:Why;student:One third,0
teacher:Can you show me why that s a half;student:Okay this is this is a half  and the red is a third,0
teacher:How can you see that in the diagram,0
teacher:I heard a lot of  people say they would call the white  one    Why would you call the white  one,0
teacher:Umm why didnt you say ten plus ten plus  ten plus ten plus ten equals fifty,0
teacher:Can you figure out reasoning behind all of this,0
teacher:Why not,0
teacher:Why cant I do two times three is six cube,0
teacher:Why not why do you object to that answer;student:Me,0
teacher:Why didnt some of you have a problem with negative 30 cubed but object to negative 20 squared,0
teacher:Do you know Ondra,0
teacher:Please tell us,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why;student:No,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:So you move six to here and why cant you subtract them;student:This X is equal to six so it becomes six minus Y is 10,0
teacher:Why do you write down 180 degrees plus 180 degrees,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why did you think it might be wrong,0
teacher:Then well can you say why you got a mathematical expression like this,0
teacher:Why;student:Its not included,0
teacher:Why does it end up as this kind of fraction,0
teacher:How do you know that this is four,0
teacher:Why is that,0
teacher:Why cant we calculate it;student:Yes five X minus four Y cant be calculated,0
teacher:And what is it or why is it that we cant add them together;student:Two A plus three A to the second power,0
teacher:Which ones cant be calculated and explain why,0
teacher:Why didnt you start counting by  twos or tens,0
teacher:Why  times ten,0
teacher:Why are you telling me five times  ten,0
teacher:Ok why did you why  did you decide to do that to use a  multiplication problem to help you,0
teacher:Ok you say that very uncertainly but why do you think that;student:One sixth one sixth,0
teacher:Well why did you take off two of these off;student:What I did before when I was  ready I took off two of the red and one of the the light green,0
teacher:Why do you think it didnt fall this time,0
teacher:And how do you know that;student:One half and one third,0
teacher:Why did I say F E D;student:You said F E D,0
teacher:All right and how are you going to know what size the angle is,0
teacher:Why not;student:No,0
teacher:Okay  so what is twenty five and twenty five what  made you decide on using twenty five,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:How do you know that triangle is rightangled,0
teacher:So how do you explain or how do you convince us that this triangle,0
teacher:So why do you think it should be minus,0
teacher:Well why four times for instance;student:When I will have three centimeters times four,0
teacher:Do you know why,0
teacher:The perimeter in this case the perimeter of a square would be a problem in this case why because you dont know,0
teacher:Why are you changing it,0
teacher:You may but why would you do that since you have the formula;student:Diameter and then I can change it to,0
teacher:And why didnt you calculate two squared which is four minus three equals one times five,0
teacher:Why does it say 100 it does say negative 100 but why does it say 145 on the board;student:Negative,0
teacher:I would like someone to explain why,0
teacher:Why;student:Yeah,0
teacher:Prove it to me,0
teacher:Why did you select the mean rather than the uh the mode for example,0
teacher:Can you convince me you re absolutely sure,0
teacher:Now why is this 23,0
teacher:Why is this 23,0
teacher:16 why Natasha;student:16,0
teacher:Marshall why is one trapezoid 12,0
teacher:Why do we agree with Ashton;student:Yes,0
teacher:Rebecca why do we agree with Ashton that 23 is the same thing as saying 46,0
teacher:Why can I not add three fish and one snake,0
teacher:Cant I add three fish to one snake,0
teacher:Why;student:No,0
teacher:Why 44;student:Our first fraction would be 44,0
teacher:Why;student:You wouldnt subtract the denominator only the numerator,0
teacher:Why wouldnt I subtract the denominator only the numerator,0
teacher:The question I asked you was why dont I subtract my denominators,0
teacher:When we are adding our fractions why is our denominator not changing,0
teacher:Why does that not equal 38,0
teacher:Why dont I add 4  4,0
teacher:Okay why does this not equal 38,0
teacher:I only add the numerators but why;student:Because you only add the denominators not the numerators,0
teacher:Im asking why,0
teacher:Im telling you guys right now yes you only add the numerators not the denominators but why,0
teacher:Why am I not adding my denominator,0
teacher:Jude what did your table say,0
teacher:I cant change the denominator but why;student:Because you cant change the denominator,0
teacher:Why is the blue rhombus 13,0
teacher:Someone explain to me why is the blue rhombus 13,0
teacher:Why is that a hexagon Miranda,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why wouldnt you add;student:If you have  if youre doing one half youre still multiplying both probabilities,0
teacher:Why not,0
teacher:David why dont you come up here and  explain your reasoning,0
teacher:Whats  whats your reasoning,0
teacher:Why  do you think there isnt any,0
teacher:Why one;student:One,0
teacher:Can you help me  understand why you think five,0
teacher:Why do you think that works,0
teacher:I mean why do  you think that that works,0
teacher:Why thirteen,0
teacher:Ah so why does he think that the clear might be like camouflage;student:A clear one could be an animal that  camouflages,0
teacher:If those arent the same and if adding my denominator isnt going to get the same answer that I want who else can put in their own words why we cant add the denominators together,0
teacher:How did you know how many zeros to put;student:I am,0
teacher:Why did you do 22 2;student:I did 22 2,0
teacher:Margo stop doing what youre doing and tell us why you put seven and eight tens,0
teacher:How did you know that you had to add;student:Oh we had to add 17 cents to 146,0
teacher:Why is it the same Matty,0
teacher:If you did not get that you need to look back at your work and figure out why did you not get a 102,0
teacher:Why 15;student:Blue is the 15,0
teacher:No because why couldnt I say 110 210 310 410 1010;student:No,0
teacher:Why couldnt I say that,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:You know why,0
teacher:How do you know that Sylas,0
teacher:How do you know that;student:There were only four zeros,0
teacher:Why 3x39 Wade;student:3x39,0
teacher:Why is 3x39 nine,0
teacher:Why;student:No,0
teacher:Id like to hear from an A Dan why cant we just move that X,0
teacher:And youre looking for one that has Why do you think that its that one,0
teacher:Why this;student:Like this,0
teacher:Why do you think its five;student:I figured it out I think its five,0
teacher:How come;student:I think the mean,0
teacher:Tell us why;student:The mode,0
teacher:How come;student:I think the mean represents the,0
teacher:Who do you think is correct and why,0
teacher:how come,0
teacher:Why do we do 6 plus 2 first,0
teacher:Why do I want to add this column right here,0
teacher:I would like to hear from an A why can we not just move that X,0
teacher:With a raised hand can you guys tell me why I want to add that information in the first column Bailey,0
teacher:How comes youre proposing three;student:Maybe you multiply by 3,0
teacher:Why would dividing by 10 work;student:You could divide by 10,0
teacher:Why;student:I think its 80100,0
teacher:Lucas why do you enjoy Costco,0
teacher:Why;student:Mr Lees class,0
teacher:How do you know that its between one and two and then its not smaller than one,0
teacher:How do you know that its a little bit bigger than one,0
teacher:Who do you agree with and why,0
teacher:Tell me why you chose multiplications;student:If the children can walk run 18 of a mile in an hour how many hours,0
teacher:Can you convince me,0
teacher:Looking at the graphs in the list Id like you to turn to your table partner or someone whos sitting next to you and I want you just to say who do you think is the better surfer and why,0
teacher:Will each yurt have six campers no because and finish that thought,0
teacher:Tell me why youre guessing then;student:Yeah you cant prove it,0
teacher:Tribe buddy B I want you to tell tribe buddy A why can you not just move the X,0
teacher:Why is that a problem,0
teacher:Why is 94 not a mixed number,0
teacher:Hey why is an improper fraction always bigger than one,0
teacher:Why do you think,0
teacher:Dakota why did you say were going to add all the numbers up,0
teacher:Why three plus one;student:Then I did equals three and then I did 31,0
teacher:Hunter can I ask you why did you skip 11 12;student:6 x 10  60 6 x 100  600,0
teacher:Why did you skip all of those and go straight to 600,0
teacher:Tell me why;student:Because we dont need the small problems,0
teacher:Why dont we need the super small problems,0
teacher:Why;student:Then we take 300 and put it on the side of,0
teacher:All right why;student:Were all drawing 37 circles,0
teacher:Why can you not just move this X to here,0
teacher:Why;student:The remainder,0
teacher:Why is this answer better than our first one,0
teacher:Why else Myles,0
teacher:Me Im the vertex why;student:You,0
teacher:Why am I the vertex of this angle Patrick,0
teacher:Auden why is this an acute angle,0
teacher:How do you know,0
teacher:What do you think is the typical number of people who live in a house on Pirate Street and why,0
teacher:Partner A I want you to say what the typical number of people is and why,0
teacher:Person A two by two partner what is the typical number and why,0
teacher:How come;student:Im thinking that its four,0
teacher:How come;student:Six,0
teacher:Why are you worried about that little circle up there that you can barely see;student:The little circle up there,0
teacher:Why wouldnt you;student:Cause you still have four one thirds and one two thirds,0
teacher:Why am I the vertex of this angle,0
teacher:Which is;student:The same reason the last time,0
teacher:Why don t you do that in general,0
teacher:Okay what made you  decide there werent more,0
teacher:And why do you think they have been switched by the other  way around;student:Because there could be like switched around,0
teacher:Why do you think there would be more,0
teacher:Why;student:I think it would be less towers,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why;student:I think there might be less,0
teacher:Why do you think the same kind of patterns;student:But at the same kind of patterns but fewer numbers,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Why;student:We think its the same,0
teacher:Why,0
teacher:Aaron thinks it might be six why Aaron,0
teacher:How come;student:Its less there is only eight,0
teacher:Why do you think that it happened,0
teacher:Why do you  think so,0
teacher:So why why does one plus three give you four,0
teacher:So can you explain to me for instance  why that works,0
teacher:So why is why is that,0
teacher:Why do you think that Why do those numbers  seem to work;student:All right,0
teacher:Which is  the A and which is the B and why is it okay to  call them As and Bs,0
teacher:Why is it a red here and why is it a white here;student:Because two of em equal up to a red like the orange and the,0
teacher:Why not;student:Looking at this it would not be fiftieths,0
teacher:If you were to build a bigger  model can you predict can you predict without building it what  your comparisons might look like,0
teacher:Can you predict it in your minds  and maybe sketch it or,0
teacher:Why do you think that  happened,0
teacher:Ok Danielle why do you think 112,0
teacher:Why did you first have six;student:Now our first answer was six but then again  we thought it was three,0
teacher:You think its four why;student:I think its four,0
teacher:What was it 24 and 30,1
teacher:Do I have any grouping symbols;student:I dont really get the steps,1
teacher:Do we have any exponents,1
teacher:Do you see any multiplication or division,1
teacher:Yes Lexy;student:I didnt,1
teacher:Joy,1
teacher:It doesnt matter what color card they have but you need to read very carefully if you are finding LCM or GCF got it,1
teacher:Then youre going to trade cards got it,1
teacher:I might say something like he got it right but I could say like Brandon you found a common factor but not the greatest common factor or I could look at his division ladder and I could maybe find a mistake on his division ladder as well okay,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Four to the second;student:Two,1
teacher:What do you say to me,1
teacher:Okay so you ask me your question,1
teacher:All right we have time to do one more together yes Mia;student:Four to the second and then,1
teacher:Do we have any exponents,1
teacher:Do we have any grouping symbols;student:I think you do Im confused,1
teacher:you have a question,1
teacher:It was that one over here,1
teacher:Can I stop you there for just a minute;student:Then for the common factor,1
teacher:Yes Rose;student:Okay,1
teacher:Do six and four have any common factors;student:Four,1
teacher:Isla,1
teacher:What was yours,1
teacher:Paige;student:Okay,1
teacher:All right go for it Paige,1
teacher:Yes Alan,1
teacher:Grant,1
teacher:Is there anything inside those grouping symbols,1
teacher:Any questions on that page,1
teacher:Do you guys see how much work that I showed there,1
teacher:Yes Isaac,1
teacher:Do you guys see how Im rewriting my whole problem,1
teacher:Alan did you just catch that error that we noticed;student:The 15 one,1
teacher:Yes Valerie,1
teacher:Eliza,1
teacher:We are going to finish your note catcher tomorrow all right,1
teacher:Yes Charles,1
teacher:Yes Abby,1
teacher:Yes I thought theyre smaller but its still more treats right,1
teacher:Oh whats your question,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:You could yes go for it Sophia,1
teacher:Alicia,1
teacher:Oh 11;student:Yes 11,1
teacher:That you see how it would be in the middle,1
teacher:Do you notice how we have two for all of these its a little bit easier to compare all of them;student:That makes sense,1
teacher:Any other questions you guys would like me to answer on your warm up for today,1
teacher:Yes;student:Wait,1
teacher:Do you want to go over that one of 12 and 8;student:Okay,1
teacher:Whats your question,1
teacher:Are we back on track,1
teacher:Do you have any more questions before we move on,1
teacher:Whats your question Michael;student:Im still confused,1
teacher:What questions can I answer for you guys,1
teacher:Any questions before you guys work independently or sort of independently,1
teacher:6 right,1
teacher:Rob,1
teacher:Lyra,1
teacher:We had one person who went talk and the other person went  talk talk talk talk talk talk talk okay,1
teacher:The difference about it being written as a fraction instead of it being part to whole this is part and I want you to write this in part two parts okay,1
teacher:The square multiplying boxes;student:Yes I like  square multiplying boxes,1
teacher:Whats up;student:Its Colorado,1
teacher:We can go Yes,1
teacher:Lyra last one,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Good job keep going,1
teacher:Yes Michael,1
teacher:Sure go for it;student:Can I  another,1
teacher:Can I show people how you did that with the ratio table,1
teacher:You multiplied both of these by 2 right,1
teacher:Crew any other questions,1
teacher:Im trying to get to by the end Im trying to get to 5 yurts okay,1
teacher:You started with 200 divided by 5;student:You first see the 200s,1
teacher:Yes Nate,1
teacher:Whats up,1
teacher:Can you help me with this one Lexy,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:You guys does that if I go back does that make sense why we cant just move values,1
teacher:You guys ready for all of them,1
teacher:Do you see how each of these bars each of these four bars goes to three,1
teacher:Yes Gavin,1
teacher:to find the median;student:We dont understand how youre supposed to find the median,1
teacher:Do you remember our valueordered bar graphs,1
teacher:Does that make sense   orderedvalue bar graph,1
teacher:Sound good so far,1
teacher:Sound good,1
teacher:Anna could you read to us please,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Go for it Anna,1
teacher:Can you talk a little bit louder so that the people know the other side of;student:The answer is 15,1
teacher:Okay start over Carson,1
teacher:Before we move on do you guys have any other questions,1
teacher:Ashley did you want to share or did you have a question,1
teacher:Were not looking at numbers for our answers okay,1
teacher:Okay so this is what I heard Yes;student:I got,1
teacher:Eli,1
teacher:You can all tell me,1
teacher:Should we start over with this one,1
teacher:Four;student:Four,1
teacher:Four;student:Four,1
teacher:Yes Claire;student:Yes,1
teacher:Do you guys remember when I told you theres two ways that were going to find mean,1
teacher:What street should this data be on,1
teacher:Just tell me what you think,1
teacher:With the squares;student:I counted for,1
teacher:You can just tell me one two,1
teacher:Dan were going to start with you,1
teacher:Who is going to reiterate what Dan said,1
teacher:Do you remember when your histograms were touching,1
teacher:Yes Abby;student:What if the kid has split decision,1
teacher:Is that what youre saying,1
teacher:All right you ready,1
teacher:You are saying that we have an even number of data points and we dont have to split them in half;student:The data is even so you can split it in half so it cant be a solid number and worse its in between like 50 and 50,1
teacher:Let me pose a stake I would love to hear from Abby,1
teacher:After you analyzed your data a little bit more do you still feel like 1 is your typical value,1
teacher:If we said that typically 6th graders watch one movie a month would that be accurate,1
teacher:Would that be best representing our data,1
teacher:Tom do you have something that you want to share,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Lets get started with Isaac,1
teacher:Okay youre telling me we need to do the multiplication first;student:I think Cat is correct because Dog the order of operation which is,1
teacher:All right are you clearing out some of those cobwebs,1
teacher:Do you see here,1
teacher:See how this is getting shorter and shorter every time,1
teacher:I think 10 is zero or 10 is always that right,1
teacher:Okay are there any of these that I can go over with you or I can explain it for you;student:Yes,1
teacher:What can I go over for you,1
teacher:Lexy,1
teacher:Which number is that over here;student:Sorry I think its the LCM,1
teacher:You trust that;student:So Im going to say around 4 and then it turned out to be the mean so I trust that,1
teacher:Say that again I missed what you said;student:Theres both median or mean,1
teacher:What did I just say,1
teacher:Did you hear what I just said,1
teacher:Crew are you ready to get started today,1
teacher:Are you ready so you switch pairs today,1
teacher:Our plan for today You guys already know how to find your median correct,1
teacher:Do you know how to find mode,1
teacher:Do you guys remember at the beginning when we were talking about average and theres three types of average,1
teacher:Go for it,1
teacher:Theres three 2s and no other value happens three times right;student:Because theres three 2s,1
teacher:Are any of those factors of 25,1
teacher:Go for it,1
teacher:The value on the bar graph;student:Because of the histogram,1
teacher:You reorganized your data values;student:The answer I got was mean,1
teacher:Did anybody solve this using an algorithm,1
teacher:Thats true in golf but do you think that it represents how he is as a golfer;student:In golf youre trying the lowest score,1
teacher:Do you think there could be times when the mode could best represent the data;student:Because the mean averages it in a more accurate Why because youre adding all the actual values out but then when youre using the median you use the number of values  represents all of the,1
teacher:You think;student:The 8th graders median is 95,1
teacher:Take your time do your best but be efficient and well check in in just a little bit all right,1
teacher:Yes;student:A or B,1
teacher:Would that be helpful,1
teacher:Yes Kyle,1
teacher:Whats up Andrew,1
teacher:Go for it,1
teacher:Because were dividing by two right;student:You changed it to halves when you did that so its not going to be 112 its going to be 12 because you changed it to halves in that problem,1
teacher:The second number here is going to tell you what your denominator is right,1
teacher:If I say pause here a lot will it be in our work page again,1
teacher:Crew what questions do you have;student:I got my grading,1
teacher:Yes Reese,1
teacher:What other questions can I answer for you guys,1

teacher:Does anybody recognize where this comes from,1
teacher:Where you may have seen this,1
teacher:Olivia do you know you may have seen this problem before,1
teacher:Hannah lets start with you,1

teacher:Do you want to look there real fast,1
teacher:Whats your question,1
teacher:Partner A go for it,1
teacher:Talk to your friends,1
teacher:Bs have you been talking yet;student:What,1
teacher:Did you do some stuff,1
teacher:You have to think about what this number would need to be in order to get to three;student:They have to check it with,1
teacher:Which one are you working on there,1
teacher:Did you write it as an improper fraction and get 163 divided by 35,1
teacher:You look at it for a minute and Ill be back to review okay;student:Hold on,1
teacher:For the second parts;student:To getting the pieces I did 35 divided by 89,1
teacher:Hey Olivia whats up,1
teacher:Any other questions on the row for number four,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Yes Kyle,1
teacher:You did;student:I think I got it,1

teacher:Can you wait and ask in front of everyone else in case someone has your same question;student:Of course you can its your turn,1
teacher:What;student:We are just looking at the same lesson on  it must have a mike on thats the problem,1
teacher:Melanie is there anything you need me to check so far,1
teacher:Have you used your inverse operations to check your answer,1
teacher:How are you guys doing;student:Three and a half,1
teacher:For Which ones;student:Is that right,1
teacher:Are you totally finished;student:Wait do I get a sticker,1
teacher:Did you check,1

teacher:Do you think we need to go all the way to 200,1
teacher:Is that going to be enough to feed everybody,1
teacher:Its hard to be a good coach huh;student:You could see if you could add one of the columns maybe twice or,1
teacher:Is there a column we could add;student:You could see its in another column that you could use not just the 40,1
teacher:Is this enough,1
teacher:Remember how we mark it up like what were doing between columns,1
teacher:You can multiply 4 times 25 to get to 100 and 3 times 25 what did I say,1
teacher:Money or quarters right,1
teacher:Dwayne you want to do it,1
teacher:Do you have a question,1
teacher:Ellie are you ready;student:Okay,1

teacher:Yes Lucas;student:I agree,1
teacher:You guys ready,1
teacher:Avery,1
teacher:Yes Cooper,1
teacher:Wait  multiply that column we can add a column;student:Could we multiply it by the first column,1
teacher:As far as the math goes,1
teacher:To multiply by 30,1
teacher:Is that right,1
teacher:Are we good so far,1
teacher:Does that make sense crew,1
teacher:Do you have any questions as were going through,1

teacher:What other questions do you guys have,1
teacher:Ariana whats your question,1
teacher:Ashley we are going to start with you;student:Because it says part of our homework,1
teacher:So I heard you say that 14 is equivalent to 28;student:I agree with the first one phrase because on 14 if you multiply both of the numbers by two it gets you to 28 which is really close to the,1
teacher:Okay like equivalent fractions;student:I would say to make sure that you check what the numbers can be,1
teacher:What does that say,1
teacher:Do you have a question,1
teacher:What could your question be,1
teacher:Thats for like 80 cents is the 80 cents bigger;student:810 wait,1

teacher:I have 10 and 1015 yes,1
teacher:The common multiple;student:How do you find the common multiple,1
teacher:Yes Jordan,1
teacher:Please say that again for me;student:I think you only because if you do 3 times 5 is 15 and 3 times 2 is six and yet three times,1
teacher:You guys feeling okay about that one,1
teacher:Is that coming back to you a little bit from elementary school;student:Yes,1
teacher:One two three,1

teacher:Did you guys hear what Amalia said,1
teacher:Got it,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Its a fraction always a half;student:A fraction is a half,1
teacher:Meredith,1

teacher:Youre talking about this,1
teacher:Are you talking about this  right here,1
teacher:Okay first of all to do this we have to know what an equation is right,1
teacher:It has one of our order of operations and then it has What did you say,1
teacher:No because 1  1  2 is an equation right;student:No,1
teacher:Lucille,1
teacher:Okay Hadley can you say that in your own words;student:Yes,1

teacher:Not with their writing not with their sentences but with the answer they got okay,1
teacher:Okay so you think some of you guys can be doing pictures and some of you guys can be doing partial quotients;student:Because I asked them if they wanted to do partial quotientsor pictures,1
teacher:Are you guys writing this together;student:It might have took Ian longer to put the dots but it would have been easier to say you dont have to waste up a whole,1
teacher:How many six can go into 47 right,1

teacher:All right Hunter keep going,1
teacher:Keep going Hunter,1
teacher:Thats all you did;student:Then 6 x 200  1200 and then 6 x 300  1800 and thats our question,1

teacher:Less than would be the same as greater than;student:No more than,1
teacher:Tera,1
teacher:Bruce,1
teacher:Youre adding;student:I know the answer is yes because it would be greater because youre adding,1
teacher:Is the value of the expression less than 798212,1
teacher:Is the value of the expression less than,1
teacher:Get it;student:Because its being divided by two so thats only half to 798212,1
teacher:Lisa would you like to read that please,1

teacher:Ophelia,1
teacher:Maxine,1
teacher:Six blocks east and what;student:Six blocks east and four blocks north,1
teacher:Was that on your grids,1
teacher:Miriam does that help a little bit for this one,1
teacher:Terri,1
teacher:Tate,1
teacher:Miriam,1
teacher:Got it,1
teacher:Whats up Wallace,1
teacher:Amari,1
teacher:One of the most frustrating things is when it asks When Im asking you to get 100 and if you miss one question you dont get 100 at the end right,1
teacher:When you think you got seven out of seven is that 100;student:On this how do you,1
teacher:Guys how are you doing back here;student:I got the donate in there,1
teacher:How are we doing,1
teacher:Is that accurate;student:I did Oh my God,1
teacher:Guys how are we doing over here,1
teacher:Alanna what was that,1
teacher:Martha,1
teacher:Show me on your fingers how many more minutes you think you might need to get all six warmup questions done,1
teacher:Sterling,1
teacher:Tate,1
teacher:Maxine,1
teacher:Tate,1
teacher:Ameli,1
teacher:Are those labeled on your map,1
teacher:Its a corner right;student:A corner,1
teacher:Are we all good,1
teacher:Mika will you please read the instructions from number one,1
teacher:Clay,1
teacher:Roberto,1
teacher:Connect the points in the same order that you plot them so is it a good idea to plot all your points and then try to connect them,1
teacher:Yes so its you plot and then draw your lines okay;student:You draw the dot and then you draw the lines on there,1
teacher:What;student:Youre welcome,1
teacher:Does that look right to you,1
teacher:Does it,1
teacher:Is it,1
teacher:Did you erase that line,1
teacher:Do they look like sailboats,1
teacher:You need help,1
teacher:If you look at the rule for the new sailboat one so remember we are applying rules put your finger on page 134 where it says new sailboat one your rule is AJ will you read the rule please,1
teacher:Okay everybody repeat that;student:The rule is double each number of the original pair,1
teacher:Lisa,1
teacher:Nessa will you please read the learning target for today,1
teacher:Those of you who did not have answer two for your final answer do you now understand it;student:Yes,1
teacher:23;student:Because I rounded one and then three,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you and your group have found all three squares,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you found at least two squares,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you have found at least one rectangle,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you  yes two rectangles you could keep your hands raised;student:I found two rectangles,1
teacher:Three rectangles,1
teacher:Whats the next one triangles,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you found a right triangle at least,1
teacher:Say the word conjecture,1
teacher:Right triangles;student:Im about to,1
teacher:Lastly what is it parallelogram,1
teacher:Raise your hand if your group has found a parallelogram,1
teacher:When I say showdown you show each other and when you all come to a consensus then I want you all to stand up okay,1
teacher:Clay,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Thats close to a half so can we make an estimate now,1
teacher:Franc I think maybe your confusion was that you werent sure that the highest one is two so you had two and something right,1
teacher:Two right triangles,1
teacher:Alexia question,1
teacher:Erin can I get you to read the instructions please,1
teacher:The question is Sammie will you read the question;student:Double the first coordinate of all the points,1
teacher:Are you guys done,1
teacher:When we do showdown when everybody is done if everybodys good then you stand up right,1
teacher:Please stand up when youre done,1
teacher:Zoey did you get something,1
teacher:Paul will you please read our Learning Target for today,1
teacher:Mariah,1
teacher:Clay,1
teacher:We talked a lot last week about You need to be paying attention right,1
teacher:Mika,1
teacher:Did you guys not talk about it,1
teacher:Tera,1
teacher:Straight in a line;student:It means to have them straight or in a line like,1
teacher:Hudson,1
teacher:Say it AJ,1
teacher:Are we clear,1
teacher:where are you,1
teacher:Everybody say misalign,1
teacher:Do you think that because you understand the math you dont need to listen to me,1
teacher:Did you show us what the answer was,1
teacher:Then when he When there were leftovers for the tenths then he had to go into the next column right;student:Yes,1
teacher:Is this 54,1
teacher:He knew that there were six left here so he took Am I right that you took six from the 33,1
teacher:Do you guys see that,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:I was just thinking Do you want to share yours,1
teacher:Is that the most interesting one or do you want to talk about a different one,1
teacher:You knew you needed seven there and you finish the three here,1
teacher:The only other thing that I was looking for and I dont think anybody did it was there arent any rights or wrongs but just to have shaded them next to each other and then Can I share yours,1
teacher:Talk to your friends or talk to your partner about how you solve that,1
teacher:Serena,1
teacher:Will you come show,1
teacher:Youre just going to explain it differently;student:I kind of,1
teacher:Do we have a different strategy yet,1
teacher:Audrey,1
teacher:If I am addressing the whole class what do you need to be doing,1
teacher:Everybody say alignment;student:Misalign,1
teacher:AJ,1
teacher:Tell me in your own words,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:On the first one Mariah will you please read the instructions,1
teacher:Okay so when you do an estimate it needs to be just like that okay;student:5  3,1
teacher:Then check to make sure it makes sense okay,1
teacher:Would you like to read the learning target,1
teacher:Talk to your friends at the table,1
teacher:Sorry I interrupted you;student:Yes I was trying but someone was interrupting me,1
teacher:Okay Andrew,1
teacher:Your balance in your banking account,1
teacher:Are you guys listening,1
teacher:Tera are you listening,1
teacher:That would be in balance right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:Student number three stand up,1
teacher:Any question,1
teacher:Its kind of cool huh,1
teacher:Did I get the same number,1
teacher:Once again I have to make sure that that is aligned right,1
teacher:Tell your neighbor,1
teacher:Okay go,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Stella,1
teacher:Christoph,1
teacher:Clay,1
teacher:Since were subtracting we do need a place value holder here right,1
teacher:You made the tenths first,1
teacher:Everybody tell me,1
teacher:Did you guys all see that,1
teacher:Are you ready for this craziness,1
teacher:Were going to start with 7291 and were going to count up to this because this is what we end up with right,1
teacher:Do guys all get that,1
teacher:Were not there yet are we,1
teacher:Do you guys see why I did 148,1
teacher:That is the number that Im looking for right,1
teacher:Can I take one away from zero,1
teacher:Keep going,1
teacher:Clay thank you for being brave,1
teacher:To do those problems;student:Yes,1
teacher:So your trapezoid looked different in what way;student:You doubled the coordinates if you double the Xaxis and not the Yaxis,1
teacher:It was twice as wide;student:We double it,1
teacher:Penny,1
teacher:Penny was talking about which coordinate you were talking about the Xaxis right,1
teacher:Nessa,1
teacher:Hudson,1
teacher:Angela,1
teacher:Can you please read this with me,1
teacher:Jake wants his book to be larger he wants a larger picture of the book so were going to enlarge that book right Missy,1
teacher:Yes it was like a spider web right;student:It just became a big mess,1
teacher:Do you have any questions about the problem,1
teacher:I want you to talk to your shoulder partner about what you understand the problem is before you get started,1
teacher:I want you to talk to your neighbor about what you think you have to do,1
teacher:Remember how Audrey worded her rule,1
teacher:Franc,1
teacher:Franc,1
teacher:No questions,1
teacher:It stayed the same because if you double zero 0x2 is still zero right;student:It stayed the same,1
teacher:Did your new trapezoid already look the way you expected it,1
teacher:Franc,1
teacher:Space;student:Space,1
teacher:Vicki,1
teacher:Did she say she wants to double it;student:Double,1
teacher:Franc,1
teacher:The first coordinate is on this axis right;student:I cant see,1
teacher:Okay and did anybody write down the new coordinates;student:Horizontally it moves away so I thought if move it away,1
teacher:Come on up;student:Yes,1
teacher:You didnt write them down;student:I didnt write them down,1
teacher:Did you list the coordinates;student:I started with the,1
teacher:The first coordinate did you double the first coordinate,1
teacher:Boys and girls talk to your table group,1
teacher:It should be  right,1
teacher:The Y coordinate is always listed;student:First,1
teacher:Are we clear;student:Second,1
teacher:Did you read the instructions;student:Whats the first one,1
teacher:Were you paying any attention to this line,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Am I right,1
teacher:How much Mariah will you read it please,1
teacher:Did you guys write it down,1
teacher:Vicki,1
teacher:Stella,1
teacher:Cooper,1
teacher:Clay,1
teacher:Is worth what;student:One column is one tenth and one,1
teacher:One tenth;student:Is one tenth,1
teacher:One tenth right,1
teacher:Each column is worth one tenth right,1
teacher:Stella,1
teacher:Everybody say Addend,1
teacher:Does that make sense to you,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Are you good Penny,1
teacher:Mariah,1
teacher:Asher,1
teacher:Oh wait thats the word we just talked about;student:Explain my rea,1
teacher:My what;student:I will know when Im successful when I can accurately shade  explain my reasoning,1
teacher:Do you need me to read it or can you read it yourself,1
teacher:No its not me I dont want to read it but do you need me to read it;student:You can read it if you want,1
teacher:Are you reading along with,1
teacher:This is his original picture do you understand that,1
teacher:Do you understand that,1
teacher:Are you clear,1
teacher:Amara looks worried because there could be several correct answers right,1
teacher:You did too many right,1
teacher:Clay,1
teacher:Did you read it,1
teacher:Read it,1
teacher:This could be anything right,1
teacher:Finn will you please read it for us,1
teacher:Talk at your desk,1
teacher:Asher,1
teacher:I will know Im successful when I can Audrey will you read the success criteria for me,1
teacher:Whats up,1
teacher:Graham,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Alanna,1
teacher:Ripley,1
teacher:Is that accurate,1
teacher:15 hats for 60,1
teacher:Five hats for 1,1
teacher:Three hats for 15,1
teacher:Is that going to be a straight line,1
teacher:Okay table two every time x goes up by one is y going up or down by the same amount,1
teacher:Is that a straight line,1
teacher:No because for number three;student:Could it be a constant of proportionality like for table number three it doesnt go to zero then but it would eventually go to zero,1
teacher:Does 10 times 5 get you to this one,1
teacher:Does that sound good everyone,1
teacher:Yes;student:T,1
teacher:Whats up Julianna,1
teacher:How are you men over here,1
teacher:Yes sir,1
teacher:Questions on this page right now,1
teacher:How are we doing;student:Mine is 1200,1
teacher:Quentin;student:Yes,1
teacher:Will it take him 50 seconds,1
teacher:Does that sound good people,1
teacher:Sound good everyone,1
teacher:Are they linear or not,1
teacher:Patricks walking rate 0 0 1 2 2 9 figures right there 3 11 is that a straight line,1
teacher:Okay is that a straight line,1
teacher:Okay and then does the distance go up by the same amount every time,1
teacher:Okay does that sound good everyone,1
teacher:Is this going to be a straight line,1
teacher:Does that happen the whole way down,1
teacher:Otis question,1
teacher:Judith and then Julianna,1
teacher:Does this look like an equation that weve been talking about,1
teacher:Is that going to look like a straight line;student:Yes,1
teacher:Rio,1
teacher:Does this look like an equation that weve been looking at,1
teacher:Thats 13 of 100,1
teacher:Good,1
teacher:How are you doing up here,1
teacher:Here how are we doing,1
teacher:Is this always going down by 50,1
teacher:Does that make sense that one,1
teacher:5 regardless starts at 5 and then is sponsor B getting anything every kilometer,1
teacher:Sponsor B should be zero dollars per kilometer so its not gaining anything Malcom,1
teacher:These three blue dots are where it crosses the Yaxis and what it means is thats their donation or how much money they get no matter what Gloria,1
teacher:This kind of question has a lot of things going on it but youre reSSy just seeing is this first number times five equal to the second number,1
teacher:The second number C which means cost so zero caps for 5 is that this ratio,1
teacher:Is three hats for 15 the ratio,1
teacher:Greta,1
teacher:Could you have done the graphs and then answered Part A,1
teacher:Is this a straight line;student:Is it linear,1
teacher:Are there any other burning questions about your homework,1
teacher:Does that sound good everyone,1
teacher:Will that be more exciting,1
teacher:What does it say;student:Yes,1
teacher:Everyone good with that one so far,1
teacher:Lyles walking rate does that equation look like one that weve been working on in here,1
teacher:Everybody good with that so far,1
teacher:Luiss walking rate does that equation look pretty similar to the one I just wrote,1
teacher:How are you doing over here,1
teacher:Thats three youre going to change your answers for this;student:Oh all right,1
teacher:Let me see this line,1
teacher:Are you talking about this one,1
teacher:All you need to add in is that they started  so its 14412W and you put 100 minus  sound good,1
teacher:Rodney;student:Ive already minused this,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:You can just fill them out but then were going to use GeoGebra tomorrow okay,1
teacher:Which one the last equation;student:So that would be you put the  minus that number times,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Promise,1
teacher:Does that make sense Rodney,1
teacher:Yes Oscar,1
teacher:Is that a straight line,1
teacher:Lewis,1
teacher:Is it a straight line is it,1
teacher:Judith you know how to start right;student:it increases by 12 minusing that and then thats that,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Has anybody gotten their eyes dilated,1
teacher:Everyone ready,1
teacher:That is pretty good right;student:I think Bob is better because again he has a mode thats four and then he also has an eight surfing time thats pretty good,1
teacher:Do I need to draw any of these bars to find median;student:Were going to draw the boxes in a moment but before we draw the boxes I want to talk about median because today I really want to focus on the difference between median and mean,1
teacher:Is it two;student:Two,1
teacher:Is it in between two and two,1
teacher:Did anybody think it was going to be 25,1
teacher:Is this skewed at all,1
teacher:Did everybody remember to move it to zero,1
teacher:Sean,1
teacher:Are these different than the mode,1
teacher:How are you doing guys,1
teacher:How is it doing here,1
teacher:You got the median and the mean;student:I got the median,1
teacher:Yes Salem,1
teacher:Just looking at median does that tell us that Bob is a better surfer than Ben,1
teacher:Everybody got their graph looking like that,1
teacher:Next one,1
teacher:Eric you good back there,1
teacher:What was that,1
teacher:Has any of you tried surfing before,1
teacher:Do you think writing down your work made a difference,1
teacher:What;student:Miss Davies this fell down through this hole,1
teacher:Checking everybody has it but you got it right,1
teacher:Or everyone can get something right right;student:Everybody needs to get something wrong,1
teacher:Which ones did they have trouble with,1
teacher:Roy,1
teacher:Margie,1
teacher:What Id like you to write down here  Is it,1
teacher:It should even out at six right,1
teacher:Royal,1
teacher:16,1
teacher:Margie you were saying thats what took a while right,1
teacher:To figure out 12 times 16 should be what 172;student:Yes,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Finn,1
teacher:Does that sound good for the list,1
teacher:Are these the same,1
teacher:Looking at these numbers can we pretty much conclude that Bob is a better surfer than Ben,1
teacher:Mariana,1
teacher:Okay sound good;student:Okay,1
teacher:Is  so far done,1
teacher:There s a lot of space up there right,1
teacher:You see how those are the same,1
teacher:Does Zug pretty much look like Mug Wump,1
teacher:One other thing I want you to notice is that is this angle the same as this angle,1
teacher:Is this angle appear the same as this angle;student:Yes,1
teacher:Are these angles the same as on those two shapes,1
teacher:If you think about on a computer have you ever made a picture bigger and all of a sudden you actually drag it too far to the side and it just looks super weird,1
teacher:Are these angles the same,1
teacher:Roger,1
teacher:Lucille,1
teacher:This one,1
teacher:Lucille asked if we subtracted these two would you get back to the original,1
teacher:Rory,1
teacher:That true,1
teacher:Yes Skylar,1
teacher:Im not sure Im going to see how yes Salem,1
teacher:Yes okay so thats a completely different answer but with the same conclusion right;student:I think Seths better because his range is the smallest so his times are very consistent,1
teacher:Over here;student:Make a list of the numbers up above,1
teacher:Maggie,1
teacher:Is this median the highest of all of them,1
teacher:Maggie you all good,1
teacher:What I noticed here yes Shannon,1
teacher:For mean;student:Well Ive got the answers,1
teacher:What I noticed here is does Seth have way more boxes than these people,1
teacher:Are the angles the same,1
teacher:Is that the highest mean out of everyone,1
teacher:Then Bob would be Bob got lucky one time and sometimes thats all that matters right;student:Then Bob would be,1
teacher:Just depends what youre talking about right,1
teacher:12 minute;student:Ive had a 12 minute whiteboard time,1
teacher:Silas,1
teacher:Salem,1
teacher:Salem can you say it again,1
teacher:Marilyn,1
teacher:Pretty good and would we say that Seth is the most consistent;student:Yes Seth is pretty good,1
teacher:Here;student:For D,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:2 x 60 so its always the numbers right,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:With the equation;student:I solved it the same way exactly the same but with the equation,1
teacher:You only did it by crossing out two coins;student:I solved it with the coin and only crossing out two coins and only crossing out two bags and then crossing out two coins on that side and the two bags,1
teacher:Here;student:Yes,1
teacher:The bag and a coin is 10,1
teacher:Does anybody have an equation that uses parenthesis,1
teacher:Does everybody see that,1
teacher:Are any of these repeating,1
teacher:Travis,1
teacher:Say it again Terrance,1
teacher:Anybody tried that,1
teacher:Then you realize then youre dividing by a big number at the end right,1
teacher:Tobin,1
teacher:You mean like the X equals at the end;student:Like the answer of the equation,1
teacher:Do those sound like the same steps that we just did,1
teacher:Do you need to show your steps exactly like I do every time,1
teacher:Does that sound like the steps that we just did;student:Then you divide it by three because it said triple and you go backwards and you get nine,1
teacher:What is it,1
teacher:Those six coins get split between two pouches so then you divide it by two at the end right,1
teacher:Five so we are going to write  five and right there does this look like an equation that weve been working on,1
teacher:Yes Abel;student:Wait,1
teacher:Its like X means how many coins are in one pouch,1
teacher:Apollo,1
teacher:Are there any other questions on this one,1
teacher:Abel;student:No its not,1
teacher:Could I take half of this one as well,1
teacher:If a pouch and two coins  6 coins is that really the same answer,1
teacher:Could this be written as X  2 over here,1
teacher:Abel,1
teacher:Laim,1
teacher:Ready to try another one,1
teacher:Does that sound good,1
teacher:Abel,1
teacher:Abel,1
teacher:Yes Hunter,1
teacher:Are there any questions,1
teacher:Are there any questions about A through F of that first part,1
teacher:Wade do you know which one it is,1
teacher:Can you say it again for me;student:1x  9  2,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Aisha,1
teacher:Did anybody end up on any of these problems with x equals something,1
teacher:Anybody get to that,1
teacher:Wayne,1
teacher:Wallace,1
teacher:Alanna,1
teacher:Wouldnt it be 35,1
teacher:Oh are you wondering why its 25 instead of 35,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Aleah,1
teacher:Vance,1
teacher:I agree theyre confusing because theres xs on both sides right;student:I could not find a good answer for either of them,1
teacher:And the warmup,1
teacher:What was that,1
teacher:Youre all right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Did anybody in here get X equals 2 as a final answer,1
teacher:Timothy,1
teacher:Ramona,1
teacher:Like 10 divided by 5;student:I got five but I think its the,1
teacher:Terrance,1
teacher:For example for A2 see right here,1
teacher:Are there any questions,1
teacher:Does someone want to help us out,1
teacher:Regina,1
teacher:Tomas,1
teacher:X on both sides you see that Tobias;student:Because they have an X on both sides,1
teacher:Val,1
teacher:Then Ill also show you the assignment what its all about okay,1
teacher:Yes;student:Mr G,1
teacher:Whats up Trent,1
teacher:Is everyone okay,1
teacher:Someone else;student:I think because they have a plus on 1 or I was going to say,1
teacher:Zero times anything does it equal four,1
teacher:Other questions;student:Same I did M  120  15,1
teacher:Any other questions on here,1
teacher:Is that the same as this,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Does that make sense that its,1
teacher:Micha,1
teacher:Melvin,1
teacher:Is that what you did,1
teacher:Marshall,1
teacher:What did you say;student:Oh its negative,1
teacher:10  12 x 14  3 okay;student:Why is it correct,1
teacher:Now does this make sense if X is 14 and Y is 10,1
teacher:Do you think that line would connect to this point,1
teacher:Everybody ready,1
teacher:Go ahead Melvin,1
teacher:Miles;student:What if its a,1
teacher:Niki;student:Right,1
teacher:5  3 is 2 okay,1
teacher:Questions;student:Yes,1
teacher:How about,1
teacher:Ivanna,1
teacher:Is there a constant multiplier between these,1
teacher:Does that work for any of the other ones,1
teacher:Does that work for 3,1
teacher:Does it work for 4,1
teacher:Does it work for 1,1
teacher:Does that work for three,1
teacher:Milan you have a question,1
teacher:Marshall,1
teacher:Matias,1
teacher:Raised hands people;student:12,1
teacher:Otis,1
teacher:Did that help a little bit with your question,1
teacher:Melvin;student:Thank you,1
teacher:Harriette,1
teacher:Is the point  a solution,1
teacher:is right there is on the line;student:is not a solution,1
teacher:Ivanna,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Nova,1
teacher:Melvin a question,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Can I work backwards in the table,1
teacher:Ramsey,1
teacher:Otis you are with me,1
teacher:Evan in the back,1
teacher:Remi,1
teacher:Yes Abel,1
teacher:Abel,1
teacher:Apollo,1
teacher:Are there any questions on any of these,1
teacher:Archer question,1
teacher:35D wasnt super specific but it just said describe the graph right,1
teacher:Ariah,1
teacher:Abel,1
teacher:Instead of  Harriette question;student:Then it starts at,1
teacher:Can we write 2X  1,1
teacher:Paisley,1
teacher:Are we doing okay;student:Yes,1
teacher:Melvin,1
teacher:Ramsey,1
teacher:First of all is there a Yintercept in there,1
teacher:Yes because theres no 0 for X right;student:No,1
teacher:Down here;student:Should X be seven,1
teacher:In between the 3 In the 5 we should write 4 SS agree with that,1
teacher:Sounds good,1
teacher:Ariella,1
teacher:Ivanna,1
teacher:Question over here,1
teacher:Y 19;student:Y 192X,1
teacher:Have we done I to the L,1
teacher:Have we done L and with like;student:Yes,1
teacher:Have we done peace up and Aokay;student:Yes,1
teacher:Otis,1
teacher:Neil are we doing okay,1
teacher:13;student:13,1
teacher:Camilla did you write your thirds down,1
teacher:So this is the rule that you invented;student:Yeah this is right,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:So if you think you have an argument Erik thinks he does raise  your hand,1
teacher:You might want to talk  to your partner about your argument and see if your partner buys it,1
teacher:Does anybody need to have that shown what they  wouldve done,1
teacher:Is that all you can make,1
teacher:Erik,1
teacher:Did you hear what he said,1
teacher:So unless we use Merediths idea of creating new rods that had  that were smaller than the white rods then you could make a  smaller model Erik;student:Unless you made a new rod,1
teacher:Ok my next question is can you make one that shows the  comparison of three quarters and two thirds thats bigger than this,1
teacher:Are there others,1
teacher:You have another one,1
teacher:Ok can you leave the other one up there maybe  while youre making that,1
teacher:How many of you could imagine what it looks like even  though you havent quite built it,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you could  imagine what it looks like,1
teacher:And can you see on the overhead how  many whites those of you who dont have enough,1
teacher:Can you see,1
teacher:Right Jessica,1
teacher:Twentyfour;student:Twentyfour,1
teacher:You can see the length of  that train,1
teacher:Yeah that train we called one right;student:Well um the orange and the red,1
teacher:So youre thinking if you had more different size rods;student:Well maybe if you say you had a white rod and you divided the  white rod maybe you could make more models that way if you  divided the white rods,1
teacher:Like if you took the white rod and designed one smaller than the  white rod;student:Yeah yeah,1
teacher:Did you find is there a smallest  model when you compared three quarters or two thirds,1
teacher:Kelly you think you have something you want to come and help,1
teacher:Graham you can come and help,1
teacher:You dont have fourths;student:I dont have fourths in my one that I made,1
teacher:How about here,1
teacher:Amy,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:Jackie,1
teacher:Questions anybody;student:Ok um well um we had this model and we uh this is two thirds  and three fourths and we think that three fourths is bigger by one  twelfth,1
teacher:Are you all convinced;student:Let me show here,1
teacher:Well I said you make the smallest one you can make;student:But didnt you say to make a smaller one,1
teacher:Can you make a smaller one;student:But I dont think thats the smallest one,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:And I guess the question is  that train has a particular length right,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:How many of you have a model that shows that there are twenty four;student:I I built the model,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you have a model nearby,1
teacher:But maybe um you want to come  up here and do that,1
teacher:Thank you so much Andrew and does anybody have a  question to ask Andrew and Jessica before theyre finished,1
teacher:Does  anybody have a question,1
teacher:Does anybody have a comment,1
teacher:You  sure you dont want to ask them any of that,1
teacher:Is that interesting,1
teacher:But I guess Im asking the question uh to Meredith and James  and to Erik and Alan right now uh does this have anything to do  with your theory and the theory you tested,1
teacher:Meredith and David  and Erik and Alan  does this model have anything to do with the  theory you tested David,1
teacher:All of these  represent one is that a surprise,1
teacher:Are they related in any way,1
teacher:The lengths,1
teacher:You see this one here you  called the orange and red one isnt that right and here you called  one two orange and purple right,1
teacher:James;student:Exactly,1
teacher:I wonder if the rest of you see this Im saying this is an orange  and its not a purple its an orange and a red right;student:So its basically doubled each of the length is doubled,1
teacher:I see there are two oranges instead of  one orange I see the one orange length got doubled instead of one  orange theres two right,1
teacher:Is that what youre telling me;student:No,1
teacher:One brown was one third two browns was two thirds;student:Yeah,1
teacher:See what happens,1
teacher:Thats  what you told me,1
teacher:Ok so Sarah  and Beth you built one you dont have enough,1
teacher:Ok do you believe there are  Sarah and  Beth,1
teacher:Erin and Jackie,1
teacher:So now lets talk about um Eriks  theory Erik says now that the white one on this model the larger  model where we called one the train that was made up of two  orange and one purple right,1
teacher:That particular train that he built,1
teacher:Does anyone think the answer is one twenty fourth,1
teacher:I dont have enough of these blocks so I  said can you imagine it and I remember talking and I know Andrew  actually made the model when David had a theory that he shared  with um Erik and Alan and Meredith right David,1
teacher:Meredith,1
teacher:And then Jessica said that they already built  what the theory was thats what I heard so Id like to hear um  Davids theory again if you dont mind David if you think you can  remember your theory and Andrew I want you to listen very  carefully and Jessica and the rest of you I want you to listen  carefully to Davids theory because it really has to do with if I were  to make another model is it possible do you think to make another  model if we had more blocks it is a possible thing to do,1
teacher:How many of you think we can make another model,1
teacher:Some of you arent sure how many of you arent sure,1
teacher:Merediths not sure,1
teacher:Eriks not sure,1
teacher:Danielles not sure,1
teacher:How many of you are sure we can make another  model,1
teacher:Ok that looks like  thats James and Alan and Andrew and Jessica and Beth and Sarah  Kelly Graham Brian Michael Caitlin did I leave anybody out,1
teacher:How many of you think we can,1
teacher:Isnt that true,1
teacher:Anybody else,1
teacher:You think thats it;student:Well we got six,1
teacher:And theres this little pie that gets  delivered did you ever see these personal pizzas these small  ones right,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:Meredith,1
teacher:Are you  allowed to compare different things when you compare  fractions,1
teacher:Is that really fair,1
teacher:Is that really fair,1
teacher:Michael,1
teacher:We don t want to fall into that trap can we have an  agreement in this class,1
teacher:Do you understand that,1
teacher:Is that clear here,1
teacher:Is that clear here,1
teacher:As I walk around and  I watch what youre doing are we allowed to switch candy  bars,1
teacher:Are we allowed if were making a half and third are we  allowed to have different size candy bars;student:No,1
teacher:Sure it s a quarter,1
teacher:Change your mind;student:Oh,1
teacher:Isnt that right,1
teacher:You can all see that right,1
teacher:So its sort of dishonest to  switch candy bars isnt it right,1
teacher:Michael,1
teacher:Can you all imagine half of it,1
teacher:So you would get six out of a total of twelve right;student:Six,1
teacher:Gregory,1
teacher:Gregory nice and loud,1
teacher:Gregory nice and loud so everyone can hear you back there,1
teacher:Four out of twelve right;student:Um four,1
teacher:How many of you  would pick a half of it,1
teacher:How many of you would pick a third  of it,1
teacher:You d all pick a half right,1
teacher:However is it possible is it possible if I were talking about  different candy bars,1
teacher:Could you imagine if it were possible that a third  could be more than a half,1
teacher:How many of you could imagine  that,1
teacher:Andrew,1
teacher:Of the big one;student:I would want the third,1
teacher:How many of you would want the third of the big one;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Sort of a little dishonest is she;student:Because you uh you were gonna split up a big one so but  then she ran back and got the little one and split that in half  and gave that half to him and then she took the big one and  got a third of it and ate that piece,1
teacher:Do  you think you know,1
teacher:How  many of you think you know what number name you would  give to the piece that s bigger,1
teacher:How many of you think  you ve answered that problem,1
teacher:One fourth,1
teacher:You think one fourth,1
teacher:Anybody else,1
teacher:Youre not sure,1
teacher:Well thats something to think about this weekend ok,1
teacher:Do you  remember how Everybody here has worked on it isnt that true,1
teacher:Raise your hand if youve worked on that problem,1
teacher:Ok the question how many of you have built  two models for that problem,1
teacher:For that problem which is larger  three quarters or two thirds how many of you built two models,1
teacher:Ok how many of you have built more  than two models,1
teacher:Michael,1
teacher:Thats what you were trying to figure out;student:Thats what I was trying to figure out,1
teacher:Those of you who built three models do you  think thats all,1
teacher:Can you build more,1
teacher:This table here Jackie and  James Amy you think there can be more,1
teacher:Andrew,1
teacher:Anybody,1
teacher:Okay we could try that experiment on  Monday right,1
teacher:A little white;student:Um maybe a little white  these,1
teacher:Gregory did you figure that  out yet,1
teacher:James did you figure that out,1
teacher:Okay this is one right,1
teacher:Do you  understand the question,1
teacher:How many of you think you know  the answer to that,1
teacher:Alan,1
teacher:David will you share this on Monday  you think you can build this all again,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:Youll remember  what you just built there,1
teacher:Maybe we can start with having them share this  balance that youve made,1
teacher:It did fall to that side didn t it;student:When he removes the one light green rod  and the two red   leaving one light green rod and one  red rod his structure falls to the side of the light  green rod,1
teacher:Do you understand my question,1
teacher:Okay now if you didn t want it to collapse right;student:I took off the two reds and a light green,1
teacher:It it you  said it fell to the right the way you had it built okay,1
teacher:And the red were on the right side;student:Um,1
teacher:Do you understand my question,1
teacher:Will you help  remember,1
teacher:Cause then I could say to you is it fair to compare different  sizes,1
teacher:I see the orange got doubled here because there are two oranges  right;student:The red,1
teacher:Kimberly,1
teacher:Have you got numbers for this;student:No seven is two,1
teacher:Hum anybody check two on this one;student:Two,1
teacher:Does it work;student:Yeah two,1
teacher:Anybody prepared;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Has anybody settled any of these others yet,1
teacher:Well let me I m going to erase this one okay because we agreed on these two numbers for this,1
teacher:We are down to we just did seven right,1
teacher:Okay now uh did we get any numbers for number eight yet;student:My invention is the self dreading,1
teacher:Did anybody get any more numbers for this,1
teacher:Anybody else think they know a secret,1
teacher:Does anybody else think they know a secret;student:I ll whistle until I die,1
teacher:Brian;student:No,1
teacher:Have you got a secret;student:And eleven,1
teacher:Matt,1
teacher:Okay can I get a vote;student:I heard you say something multiples,1
teacher:Did anybody check that,1
teacher:How many of you think you know a secret,1
teacher:Does that work;student:I ll do number seven,1
teacher:Wait box times box minus seven times box plus how much;student:Minus seven times blank equals plus twelve equals zero,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Isnt it,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Isn t it,1
teacher:Hum would you put up your hand if you have that one figured out,1
teacher:Does five work for the second problem,1
teacher:Five;student:It works,1
teacher:Is that the only number that works,1
teacher:Is that right,1
teacher:Can I get everybody s attention for a second;student:One times one,1
teacher:So then when I do this when I put four in I get sixteen minus sixty is that right,1
teacher:Okay so we don t want four alright;student:I didn t do them yet,1
teacher:But did we ever get the second number for this problem,1
teacher:Huh which one is it Stephanie;student:Yeah it does,1
teacher:Will you dictate the problem to me please;student:Number six,1
teacher:How about three for that;student:Three,1
teacher:What;student:No don t erase that,1
teacher:Anybody got any others,1
teacher:Okay will you which one are you doing,1
teacher:Would you say it again;student:She said something how it s legal for some stupid reason,1
teacher:So it is legal and it s certainly true Is that alright;student:It s a whole you can start all over again,1
teacher:Who has not had a chance to talk to the camera,1
teacher:Uh could everybody hear what Mike was saying,1
teacher:Matt,1
teacher:You all know that,1
teacher:OK is everybody happy with that,1
teacher:You all know that,1
teacher:You ve got something you want to tell the camera,1
teacher:So the question is can you go and do the sort of thing Mike did and write the box and triangle,1
teacher:Take some of these other ideas but write them have you done it,1
teacher:OK come and tell the camera;student:Yeah,1
teacher:So I guess the hard problem that people are working on is number six isn t it;student:I just have to write one more thing,1
teacher:Um yeah you got six,1
teacher:Did you say it to the camera yet,1
teacher:How about three three and three;student:Three three and three,1
teacher:Uh okay so what is the next question Michelle;student:Matt stop it,1
teacher:Is that legal,1
teacher:Who thinks they know more than one;student:One but not any others,1
teacher:Six,1
teacher:Anybody checking Who is doing two,1
teacher:Michael you re doing thirty,1
teacher:Okay somebody is doing three,1
teacher:Ankur you have thirty;student:Me do thirty,1
teacher:Brian is doing three;student:Thirty times thirty,1
teacher:What;student:It s eight or thirteen,1
teacher:I have to put three in all the boxes true,1
teacher:Is that the same;student:Fifteen and two,1
teacher:Has anyone checked for five and six;student:Ohhh,1
teacher:Has anybody checked five for this problem does it work;student:Uh huh,1
teacher:Matt what are you about to say,1
teacher:Okay is there anybody who thinks they don t know any secrets about this;student:How come one never works except for the time we all think of one,1
teacher:Can I get everybody s attention for a second,1
teacher:How many people think they know one secret but not any more than one;student:And if it s seventeen,1
teacher:One but not any others;student:How many people are lost in space and are revolving around the moon,1
teacher:Do they work;student:No five and six work,1
teacher:Jessica,1
teacher:Or here;student:In the brackets,1
teacher:You have a different number;student:I think it might work with three,1
teacher:Oh I see youre calling I see youre calling one of those that top  train with the oranges and the blues and the blacks;student:No if we trade it for a no lets trade it for a blue,1
teacher:Oh my goodness can you imagine the size of that;student:Another four no another four oranges to fit five more of the  browns on so it would be a yard long probably,1
teacher:If you wan if  you wanted to make a train though where you were adding a  different color rod on the end of this train of four oranges do you  think you could come up with other models,1
teacher:It looks pretty well lets get it  this is the model you guys just had  right;student:No it was smaller,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:Hold on lets hear what David has to say for a  moment,1
teacher:Say that one more time David;student:That uh that like four fourths equals  one half which equals two halves,1
teacher:You want me to change this;student:Yeah thats what I mean,1
teacher:In the middle between numbers;student:Because um two fourths uh would be equal to right up  right next to is like in the middle of like one whole and um,1
teacher:Would you please David,1
teacher:How many of you understand  what David has done,1
teacher:Raise you hand if you understand it,1
teacher:Does anyone have a question for David,1
teacher:Hows this big model coming,1
teacher:Now what David is  suggesting which um I think helps me a lot I dont know if  it helps you that if you went to place numbers between zero  and one imagining the rods right,1
teacher:Can I ask you a question now;student:And  again if you remove that  it would take  one of those  to fill in the gap so its bigger by one half is  bigger than two fifths by one tenth,1
teacher:Does that one work;student:Mmm hmm,1
teacher:Is that what you were going to say;student:Well they used a purple and the red two reds make a purple so  now if they have a purple they doubled the red,1
teacher:Danielle,1
teacher:Do we have four oranges and two purples,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Well we have fortyeight whites going up to one here dont we;student:Cuz there would be well cuz there would be forty eight whites equal up to one and then,1
teacher:David;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Did you want to say something,1
teacher:Ok so you think you can double it and you think you can imagine   can you make one bigger than that;student:You could double that but you would have to use two rods to  make it,1
teacher:Ok the question I want to leave you all to think about Id like you  to uh first Id like to thank you for the wonderful models you built  but the question Id like you to think about is uh is there is there a  biggest model;student:If you doubled that it would be sixteen oranges  and  sixteen oranges and four browns,1
teacher:Is there a biggest model;student:Thirtytwo oranges,1
teacher:Ok do you think now that you can I mean youre working on this  one I can see do you think you can come up with one thats a  different total length than ones thats different from these two  these two have the same length;student:And then down here its basically the same size as the orange I just  made a train of a brown and a red,1
teacher:Does that one work;student:Mmm hmm,1
teacher:A working model here;student:Yup,1
teacher:Can I ask you a question now;student:And  again if you remove that  it would take  one of those  to fill in the gap so its bigger by one half is  bigger than two fifths by one tenth,1
teacher:Ok do you think now that you can I mean youre working on this  one I can see do you think you can come up with one thats a  different total length than ones thats different from these two  these two have the same length;student:And then down here its basically the same size as the orange I just  made a train of a brown and a red,1
teacher:A working model here;student:Yup,1
teacher:Jakki,1
teacher:Yeah that helps me a lot doesnt it;student:Its sort of like the Cuisenaire Rods,1
teacher:Jessica;student:Its supposed to be the purple rod one fourth would be the  white and the half is like the red or the purple I think,1
teacher:Is three going to work or not,1
teacher:Three people can talk right;student:Four doesn t work,1
teacher:Michael Michelle and Jeff,1
teacher:How about six;student:I think it s six,1
teacher:Does six work,1
teacher:How many people think they know two secrets,1
teacher:Bobby;student:Ten ten,1
teacher:Somebody say the secret again to make sure we all agree on what it is,1
teacher:Can we try can we try another kind of problem,1
teacher:Well but you know what you know what;student:I m stumped,1
teacher:Because we are looking for divisors of this right;student:The only numbers that can work are one and seventeen,1
teacher:Yeah one minus nineteen is negative eighteen right;student:It would have worked,1
teacher:Can we get it quiet here,1
teacher:Can I make a suggestion,1
teacher:Michelle;student:I think I got it I think I got it but I m not sure but I think I got it,1
teacher:Only only Michael and Michelle and Jeff can talk,1
teacher:So the only people who can talk are hum Mike and Michelle and Jeff,1
teacher:Is that alright,1
teacher:Is that okay;student:Yes,1
teacher:Its a way to build it isnt it;student:Well I think it is sort of a new way to make a number line,1
teacher:Michael,1
teacher:I think that would prove it to me would it  prove it to the rest of you,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:You did;student:I also drew a picture,1
teacher:Ok do you like to share it with us,1
teacher:How many of you understand  what James did here,1
teacher:True isn t it;student:That was three,1
teacher:And that  would therefore enable you to put them in the same place on  the number line,1
teacher:Okay was that legal;student:Put six plus six equals eight,1
teacher:Michael,1
teacher:Hum could you make it wrong both ways,1
teacher:Bobby,1
teacher:How about that,1
teacher:Okay somebody ask the next question;student:I have to think of these,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Jakki,1
teacher:Why don t you come do that,1
teacher:Are you allowed to mix up your ones,1
teacher:Is that sort of what  you re saying Audra,1
teacher:All you have to do is add one to it and it is bigger right,1
teacher:That true,1
teacher:I would say I know one bigger just add one to it right;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Some of you talked about numbers that were negative numbers right,1
teacher:That goes on for ever;student:Segments and sections because the number line is just a section of the big line that goes on and on,1
teacher:Who else in this class studied number lines and sections,1
teacher:Ever heard that before,1
teacher:You ve heard of infinity haven t you,1
teacher:We often talk about infinitely many points;student:Umhum,1
teacher:And so yes Brian,1
teacher:So the numbers we can put on this line does it ever stop or end,1
teacher:Yes Alan,1
teacher:That piece between zero and two right,1
teacher:So you thought of number  one as being half way,1
teacher:And we are just looking at this and we are sort of restricted to how  much room we have on this overhead arent we,1
teacher:That s kind of convenient isn t it,1
teacher:But if I asked you to place three the  whole number three how many of you think that you know where it would be,1
teacher:You can just read off the five right,1
teacher:Remember that David,1
teacher:Of course my question then is could there be more than  six,1
teacher:Why or why not can you prove it with the rods you have,1
teacher:Can there be more than six,1
teacher:I saw  every single person in this room thinking very very hard today and  really explaining I want you to think about one more question  especially those of you who have built six of these right,1
teacher:The question I want you all to  think about it is it possible to make more than six models,1
teacher:Because  I m wondering if you had to explain this to a younger child let s say  in the third grade and they came up with a model would it be one  that you would be familiar with,1
teacher:Is it possible for a third grader to  come up with a model with these particular rods that you haven t  seen,1
teacher:You understand,1
teacher:I want you to imagine all possible things they  can build ok,1
teacher:What do you think,1
teacher:But if I hold the ruler some of you have rulers here and I see that I m trying to imagine if this were making a rod right,1
teacher:If we are making a rod and I was talking about a rod that was a twelve rod right,1
teacher:And I think that Alan said something about a twelve rod that I could put twelve pieces here isn t that right,1
teacher:You all could imagine that can t you,1
teacher:But you could imagine they are all the same but here we don t have rods we have inches right,1
teacher:Every time I wanted to measure something I would have to count up all the ones David said didn t he,1
teacher:How many think that  you know where it would be,1
teacher:Imagine this piece of a line being  extended do you think you know where it would be,1
teacher:Okay get the idea;student:Hum I would probably put it there,1
teacher:Andrew;student:I wasnt talking about insects,1
teacher:Did you all hear what Andrew said;student:Well if you made a number line and you took a magnifying glass or a microscope and put  your number line under it you would see that you have a lot of room left to put the one hundredth onethousandth and the onemillionth,1
teacher:Okay they use to think they knew all the stars and then they invented more powerful  instruments right,1
teacher:Brian;student:If we could make more powerful microscopes then we would see more space every time  we looked through a different one,1
teacher:So you think you can put zillionths in;student:So like what Alan said you can put zillionths in,1
teacher:You are changing your mind,1
teacher:That is an interesting idea isnt it Erik;student:What I dont understand is that if you are using a microscope to get more space in actual  reality you are not getting more space,1
teacher:David;student:Yeah you just have to magnify it,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Okay Audra and then Jessica and then Mark,1
teacher:Okay Audra,1
teacher:Jessica;student:It would be really tiny but you could still see it,1
teacher:Michael said that it is sort of like the more you see the more space you  have,1
teacher:Kelly were you going to say something,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:You are the future scientists and mathematicians  and problem solvers so I want you to think about these things okay,1
teacher:You want to say that  one more time Alan,1
teacher:Erik did you hear what Alan said,1
teacher:Did you hear what Alan said;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Do you know where you would place a million;student:Umhum,1
teacher:Its beyond zero;student:I think it is negative one back there because it is beyond zero,1
teacher:Okay so its in that direction;student:That way,1
teacher:To the left of zero,1
teacher:To the right;student:This way,1
teacher:Alan,1
teacher:Do you want to know,1
teacher:Will your answer change when you change your  model,1
teacher:How many of you want to know,1
teacher:Can you say it,1
teacher:I really hope that you help out your older brothers and sisters you dont think so Amy;student:Ohm no,1
teacher:You know where to place your integers dont you,1
teacher:How many of you know how to place your integers,1
teacher:If I said you know make me a number  line with the integers would you know how to do that,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Alan;student:It doesnt,1
teacher:Can  you read it,1
teacher:Mark and then well hear from Jen,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:You see the difference here,1
teacher:Sarah and Beth want to talk a  minute,1
teacher:How many of you  think you know the answer to that,1
teacher:How many of you think  you know the answer to that,1
teacher:Ok hw many  think you know the answer to that some of you have built a James,1
teacher:You think the white is one sixth;student:I think its one sixth,1
teacher:Brian thinks its one twelfth;student:Is it one twelfth,1
teacher:Ok Laura,1
teacher:Let s see are there twelve of them there;student:So umm,1
teacher:How many of you think its one tenth,1
teacher:How many of you think it s  one sixth,1
teacher:How many of you think its one twelfth,1
teacher:I heard I heard another comment from Sara and Beth and I  would like you to share,1
teacher:But I heard Sarah something even different than that;student:And that s why we think its  twelve,1
teacher:Do you think you could write about those two different ways,1
teacher:How many think you could write about those now,1
teacher:Beth,1
teacher:Some of you are  still not sure,1
teacher:So was it okay to call white one sixth now,1
teacher:In this problem  Alan called one this  green  right,1
teacher:And you were able to make an argument to show that right,1
teacher:Do  you understand,1
teacher:Do you understand,1
teacher:Okay so is it clear what  we might hope will come out of today,1
teacher:Now where are the hands of those who really believe that they can  prove that one half is larger than one third by one sixth,1
teacher:Where are  the people who believe it can be proved,1
teacher:Raise your hand so I can  really be sure and you have no doubt and you feel very very strongly  about that,1
teacher:Ok hands up  again so I can be sure who those people are,1
teacher:Kelly,1
teacher:Ok  Michael,1
teacher:Does it matter;student:Yeah the sixth isn t the same size,1
teacher:Jessica;student:Yeah because the whole is not the same size,1
teacher:Did anybody  switch a candy bar here,1
teacher:That s true but are we doing that;student:Well they didn t switch a candy bar in that problem but from the  problem that Jessica that Jessica did he switched the candy bar  they switched the candy bar from the orange and the red to the dark  green and if you re giving someone half of the orange and red and  someone else half of the dark green the person getting half of the  orange and the red is getting a bigger piece,1
teacher:Michael,1
teacher:Andrew,1
teacher:Erik you could write about those two different ways  can t you,1
teacher:Okay both of them;student:Well I understand the problem and I feel that I can write about it,1
teacher:Both of the models,1
teacher:Now do we have another way I d like to hear from that team in that   corner Jackie and Amy and James,1
teacher:Okay so James says that in this model one half is bigger than a  quarter or one quarter is bigger than a half;student:It s one eighth yeah we think its one eighth,1
teacher:Let s start Kelly and I am going to hear from  Gregory in just a minute,1
teacher:Isn t that right,1
teacher:I think that s what  Graham did and his team right,1
teacher:Now a new team claims that one  half is bigger than a quarter by an eighth,1
teacher:Is it possible that  different models can give you different different answers,1
teacher:Some of  you think different models can give you different answers,1
teacher:Okay let s hear from Meredith she hasn t  talked in a while,1
teacher:Amy James Jacquelyn,1
teacher:one half bigger than one quarter,1
teacher:Two eighths;student:Two eighths,1
teacher:Do you think you know  Jessica or not,1
teacher:You re not really sure what the other question was anybody;student:And well I m not really sure,1
teacher:I  think what we re so used to ah what we decide what one is we begin  to get number names for the other rods like one half in this case like  one quarter in this case right,1
teacher:Do we have any other questions from  the audience,1
teacher:Can you separate those two on top a little bit because they re a  different color and they look like does that help Andrew;student:One two three four,1
teacher:They added some extra ideas  what do you think Andrew,1
teacher:Alan you have a question or a comment;student:Because there s four pieces and then they would have to put those  two pieces together to make two pieces,1
teacher:Do you understand the problem,1
teacher:How many of you think you have a solution;student:A whole model and only sized that,1
teacher:How many of you  think you now the answer to that problem and you can prove your  answer,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you think you have a solution and you  can prove your answer,1
teacher:And you know you have a solution,1
teacher:Ok I see one model up there and there s another one maybe Amy  and uh James you could build your model when their finished,1
teacher:Four;student:We have four different  models,1
teacher:Erik,1
teacher:Okay now it s listening time  because how many have one model,1
teacher:How many have three models,1
teacher:How many have four models,1
teacher:How  many have five models,1
teacher:How  many have more than five models,1
teacher:Six or seven models okay you all can listen right;student:We have six or seven models,1
teacher:Because there are  only two people here that claim they have more than five everyone  can listen and we ll learn something or we ll argue that they re  wrong right,1
teacher:Is this clear what your job is,1
teacher:How many have two models,1
teacher:Is that allowed when you re  comparing things,1
teacher:Amy,1
teacher:Wont that  be fun,1
teacher:Brian;student:Not really,1
teacher:You don t remember how you did that;student:Because  uh um,1
teacher:Because you also called it one half  didnt you you and Meredith,1
teacher:Did you all follow what what David said;student:So then this would be one  and this would be one,1
teacher:David you re  going to have to do it again,1
teacher:Michael did you follow it,1
teacher:You can help say it another way;student:All right so,1
teacher:How many of you understand;student:Alright so if this is two   then this would be a half because if you put another one and  another one that d be two,1
teacher:How many of you followed  what David said,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you followed what  David said,1
teacher:Is that what you were thinking Jackie,1
teacher:Who wants to give it a try at another way of saying it;student:No,1
teacher:You  want to give it a try,1
teacher:Go ahead Brian,1
teacher:Do you remember that,1
teacher:You re saying a red would become a half;student:When this  is two these  would be  called a half,1
teacher:Is it okay to call this  a half and call this   a half sometimes,1
teacher:Now Brian you want to come up here  because you said you had a different argument  And  Jackie,1
teacher:Do you want to pull back your argument and listen to other  people s;student:No,1
teacher:You  remember how to do that,1
teacher:Jacquelyn,1
teacher:Remember we talked about a train,1
teacher:Then the yellow and the  light green,1
teacher:Remember we talked about a train,1
teacher:Then the yellow and the  light green,1
teacher:Alan,1
teacher:T2 Okay was anyone able to figure that out;student:And the other one was if this  was considered one  what would the little red rod be,1
teacher:Okay you re all  listening,1
teacher:You  don t know,1
teacher:Is that what I heard you say,1
teacher:Erik,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Nice and loud Brian;student:We disagree,1
teacher:You re not sure you have an  argument,1
teacher:Lets  have someone else,1
teacher:And is it okay to  do it this time,1
teacher:Oh so you re saying its okay to call it one half if we call this  one;student:If we call this both of these one half it  would be one,1
teacher:When we called it  the other name two then this had to be one and this had to be  one you said because one plus one is two right,1
teacher:Does this have a half by the way,1
teacher:If I  called my candy bar dark brown right instead of yellow and  green it s the same size isn t it,1
teacher:Is that okay,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Each of those would be one half;student:Two purple would make a half,1
teacher:Do you want me to tell you,1
teacher:How many of you want  to know what I did,1
teacher:I gave Tom Purdy  half of this candy bar right down the middle right,1
teacher:You like  that,1
teacher:I gave him half didn t I,1
teacher:Did anyone ever pull that on you,1
teacher:You wouldn t  pull that on a younger brother or sister would you,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Audra,1
teacher:If I call  this candy bar one one candy bar right,1
teacher:So all of you know what a half would look like wouldn t  you;student:So the yellow is bigger than the green and the  half should be the same size,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:Would I have called it a half,1
teacher:And does that make sense to give a bigger half,1
teacher:Erik,1
teacher:Wow that s something to think about isn t it;student:So you d have therefore youd have to call one  of the reds one half,1
teacher:How many of  you understood Erik s argument,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you  understood Erik s argument,1
teacher:What do you think Michael,1
teacher:I thought some people how many of you  fell into the trap,1
teacher:When I asked you that problem right away  I said call the yellow and green two what number name  would you give red,1
teacher:You know how to do that,1
teacher:How many of you called it first one quarter,1
teacher:I think  mostly everybody fell into that trap right,1
teacher:And then when I  asked you what the yellow and green if that were given the  number name one then you said oh wait a minute right,1
teacher:How many of you like chocolate,1
teacher:Didn t I do the right thing,1
teacher:Can a half be a bigger half;student:You probably gave Tom the uh bigger a bigger half than  Amy,1
teacher:Is that  what you were thinking I did Meredith,1
teacher:Gave a bigger half,1
teacher:How many of you fell into that trap in the very  beginning,1
teacher:David;student:Okay,1
teacher:How  many of you feel pretty good at doing that,1
teacher:Did you hear her Andrew,1
teacher:Should it matter;student:Is she doing it between zero and one or zero and two,1
teacher:Does it matter,1
teacher:Can one half and one quarter go in the same spot,1
teacher:So let s hear from Laura,1
teacher:Is that better;student:It looks like a third,1
teacher:Can a fraction have more than one place,1
teacher:Erik,1
teacher:Do you want to move it over a little bit more,1
teacher:Move it over a tiny bit more,1
teacher:My question is on that number line where we said there were infinitely many points the point that has the number named a quarter could there be a different point with the number named a quarter,1
teacher:Is anyone else here confused,1
teacher:And unless we are agreeing about the same thing then we are going to keep arguing past each other you know,1
teacher:Yes Jessica,1
teacher:Now the number line that goes on and on without stopping forever and ever could we build such a model,1
teacher:That s the idea right,1
teacher:Lauren,1
teacher:Is he talked about well I could say here is a half right in the middle right,1
teacher:How about not doing it exact okay,1
teacher:It is hard up there to see isn t it Gregory,1
teacher:Alan,1
teacher:The rest of you will you help me  with this,1
teacher:You are telling me that this bar over here that is marking zero right,1
teacher:And so what you are telling me now is  that it would be really hard to place what did you say,1
teacher:Onehundredths,1
teacher:Or one thousandths,1
teacher:Laura does that help;student:I mean you could take like a really small pen and you could  divide this up into all those pieces but if you look at it with your regular eye you couldnt  see that so you would have to make it bigger,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Does anyone have a question to ask Alan about this,1
teacher:Do  you have a question for him,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:David;student:You could take the number line that has so much little space between it and if you look at  it with a very powerful microscope then you would be able to put billions in it so it doesnt  matter how big it is it could be as small as a germ and you could still put germs in it,1
teacher:Meredith;student:No,1
teacher:Remember we have infinitely many to chose from so we are not going to run out of numbers are we,1
teacher:Jessica,1
teacher:And place let s say numbers between zero and three or negative one and two or negative two and two and see what you would come up with,1
teacher:And what he is now doing is what he is doing is he is now taking the half of the length of this particular ruler right;student:Yeah,1
teacher:But if you look at the ruler you don t see in the middle here one half do you,1
teacher:Okay If you were thinking about Cuisenaire rods in a certain way you might if you were calling that Cuisenaire rod one then you would give this a number named one half wouldn t you,1
teacher:Two and one half,1
teacher:Kelly,1
teacher:Half way;student:Half,1
teacher:Half way;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Isn t that interesting,1
teacher:You know what I would like you to do;student:Yeah,1
teacher:You remember we did lots of activities with this,1
teacher:Maybe  Audra can tell us,1
teacher:Audra,1
teacher:If we gave the purple the number name one half we re going  to give the dark brown the number name one half;student:One half,1
teacher:Laura,1
teacher:Nice and loud Laura;student:Because if you put,1
teacher:I can t hear you;student:Because if you put one of these to,1
teacher:You  have to really talk loud,1
teacher:Did you all hear her;student:And that   would make that two,1
teacher:Two and one half,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you think you know where two and one half would go,1
teacher:Do you understand what I am saying,1
teacher:Jessica that is what you were saying,1
teacher:If you were calling that Cuisenaire rod twelve then you would call it a six rod right,1
teacher:Isn t that true,1
teacher:Now what is tricky here is that this line goes on and on without ending right,1
teacher:Do you understand,1
teacher:Yeah but what I want to say to you here is that if you want to put two fourths here  Is it two fourths if you are reading your ruler;student:Dr Maher what I think is since Alan says you should have two fourths here and two fourths here but each time you have a whole you have to have four fourths for each whole,1
teacher:Is it one half;student:No it s one half,1
teacher:If you are talking the distance half way between one and two that is what you are telling me to do right,1
teacher:You re pretty good at doing this,1
teacher:Between one and two right you know that half way is in the middle right,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:You put one and one half here;student:I put one and one half there,1
teacher:Jessica,1
teacher:Something to think about Meredith;student:Yeah because well I m not sure,1
teacher:If you keep adding fourths you are telling me;student:Well see if you,1
teacher:So you are telling me this is one and one half right;student:So then you would have two more fourths would equal another half which would equal a whole,1
teacher:You are telling me that would be one and three fourths;student:One and three fourths,1
teacher:Don t we,1
teacher:Do it;student:Yes,1
teacher:Now which one are you talking about,1
teacher:You have;student:We ve got a secret,1
teacher:Im going to mark it with a color and then you Is this confusing,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Bethany,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Now Ive guessed and theyre going to tell me how far away am I,1
teacher:Im one block away;student:One more block,1
teacher:Remember you cannot count crosswise okay,1
teacher:You also need to have a colored crayon or pencil because you have got to keep track of the dots okay,1
teacher:Theyre a little faded the grids okay,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:You found it;student:Its nine,1
teacher:Tell me what Lindsey are you okay,1
teacher:Speak up;student:I saw that in the 10th,1
teacher:Seven;student:I saw that in the 10th place there is a nine so I looked next door and also another nine if you rounded it up there it has to be,1
teacher:Is  your ordered pair,1
teacher:No Paul,1
teacher:What did you say,1
teacher:Bruce,1
teacher:Sammie,1
teacher:Stella,1
teacher:Except this is the grocery store can see that little dot,1
teacher:22;student:Me and Kirsten got 22,1
teacher:22,1
teacher:Youre here at the library you are at 1 3 correct;student:Yes,1
teacher:So thats 22 okay;student:So 22,1
teacher:12;student:12,1
teacher:Maurine,1
teacher:Anybody else,1
teacher:Im going to give you some clues okay,1
teacher:Tera,1
teacher:Asher,1
teacher:Finn;student:Thats seven,1
teacher:Betsy,1
teacher:CAsey,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Girls over there are you ready,1
teacher:This what you wrote out makes sense its changing is this what you wrote out,1
teacher:Should you come up with the same answers on both,1
teacher:Lets do this side first okay,1
teacher:All right what does that problem say,1
teacher:River,1
teacher:Does 13 3 go in equally,1
teacher:You should have the same exact answer shouldnt you,1
teacher:Actually you know what;student:Fraction topics,1
teacher:Is it fraction of on the computer,1
teacher:But what;student:But,1
teacher:Go ahead and talk with your neighbor again,1
teacher:How many of you guys have your answer;student:Hello,1
teacher:Do we know how much we were willing to pay yet,1
teacher:So 6X;student:Then you have to cross multiply so six equals X 6X,1
teacher:Scott,1
teacher:Did you pay 200,1
teacher:The way that they did this is this is strategy one this is strategy two right,1
teacher:Ill put this example that we just did 3420 so the first part would be 20 4 then you would do 53 thats the strategy on that one right,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Divided by right;student:Divided by,1
teacher:Minus yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:Which is whats happening when youve been given change a lot of times when people give you change youll notice that theyre counting up when they give you the change back do you notice that,1
teacher:4056;student:I got 4056,1
teacher:If I ask for a whole number should I see a decimal,1
teacher:Charlie,1
teacher:Say that again;student:So three is basically almost just,1
teacher:You knew that this seven was your marker that that was the whole number;student:So you just let it slide,1
teacher:Your job right now is All right everybody read this together,1
teacher:Margo,1
teacher:Right away you knew that this is the one that you were either going to change or not change correct,1
teacher:You looked at the two in the hundredths right,1
teacher:Do you need a zero;student:So you would leave it and change that to zero and keep 99 for one tenth,1
teacher:Ashlyn,1
teacher:Bellamy,1
teacher:Remember that multiplication like 35 53 same thing right;student:Yes,1
teacher:You mean 15 5;student:Because when youre doing times 15 youre doing 15 3 to get 3 but over there,1
teacher:Don t you have to know where the tenths place is;student:I had to know that you needed to just round the hundredths actually,1
teacher:Andrew,1
teacher:Are we okay with two and five,1
teacher:26,1
teacher:Okay so youd consider each of these a one is  that what youre saying;student:Then those two would  be considered like a regular orange so it would be considered a  one,1
teacher:Lets see  uh somebody I havent had a chance to talk with James is your  hand up,1
teacher:Kimberly,1
teacher:Did you all hear Kimberlys argument here,1
teacher:Meredith,1
teacher:Jessica,1
teacher:Youre saying  if this is five and this  is five this is six,1
teacher:You didnt mean that;student:Okay I made a mistake I,1
teacher:Ok lets see uh Andrew,1
teacher:Ok do you all follow what Andrew said here;student:I  have a solution I have a solution,1
teacher:Looks like were  into inventing our own rods again right,1
teacher:Meredith,1
teacher:I see  one of the ways that Brian has is he used light greens all light  greens and one white right,1
teacher:Ok  That would be another way to  do it wouldnt it,1
teacher:Ok lets see Sarah,1
teacher:You want to come up here,1
teacher:Oh you need another  light green you know I dont think we have any for the  overhead so maybe we could just use one of the regular  why  dont we try those ok,1
teacher:Who havent we heard from,1
teacher:Or if you can put them like this see  that space,1
teacher:Beth,1
teacher:Kimberly,1
teacher:Does it matter,1
teacher:Do you care,1
teacher:Is that is that the question,1
teacher:Alan,1
teacher:Erik,1
teacher:Can you divide things in halves and have  them different sizes,1
teacher:Andrew,1
teacher:It seems to me we have some differences  here dont we,1
teacher:Youre not saying that are you,1
teacher:You are in essence answering a different  question maybe,1
teacher:Is  that right Mr Purdy,1
teacher:Do you all see the second  condition thats not met,1
teacher:See the space in  here,1
teacher:Think  about it for a minute and you want to talk to you partner,1
teacher:Thirteen yellows;student:Thirteen yellows,1
teacher:Do you understand my question though;student:Well if you cut that  in the middle and then you  just paint the light green of each piece yellow and youre  making it thirteen and it will be equal to the train,1
teacher:So then what youre saying is if you line up the little white  cubes along the uh train with the orange and the green thered  be thirteen of them,1
teacher:What do you say now;student:Oh thats Meagan,1
teacher:Whos 20,1
teacher:What;student:Five,1
teacher:Just five;student:Five,1
teacher:Whos 17,1
teacher:On this one;student:Me and Hunter are still working,1
teacher:You dont know;student:I dont know,1
teacher:Does anybody know,1
teacher:Thirteen,1
teacher:Whos eight,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Then you got 14;student:I just did the math,1
teacher:Did anybody draw a picture;student:Yes,1
teacher:You drew,1
teacher:Serenity,1
teacher:Youre already doing it right,1
teacher:Five four,1
teacher:How are we doing,1
teacher:Did you understand,1
teacher:So you figured then that you can put have seven on  each of our halves,1
teacher:So thered be seven and seven;student:Yeah of the halves and then like youre making a new rod,1
teacher:I think we ran into the same problem didnt we;student:Oh what this guy would go,1
teacher:Would you  agree that if we went back to this model Erik where we had  these  and we were divvying them up,1
teacher:Would you agree that maybe I could take this one   and saw it in half if I had a saw,1
teacher:Daniels gonna choose our word of the day,1
teacher:Im sorry;student:UhI would want um quixotic,1
teacher:288;student:I got 288,1
teacher:One two threeeyes on me,1
teacher:Noah,1
teacher:Okay we re going to total each one so I m going to need each group to be ready okay;student:One two three four five six seven eight nine,1
teacher:Everybody read the learning target with me at the top,1
teacher:I know I am successful when Paulina,1
teacher:Okay and Lindsey;student:I explain my thinking to my team,1
teacher:Well thats not really explaining is it,1
teacher:Standley,1
teacher:Alana,1
teacher:Do you like that,1
teacher:You are going to work with your partner or the people around you,1
teacher:Grant,1
teacher:You guys talked about SS that you noticed,1
teacher:Say again;student:Do we have to cut them like that,1
teacher:Do we have to cut them like that,1
teacher:Make sure youre not picking up anybodys okay,1
teacher:You SS done,1
teacher:Brett are you okay,1
teacher:Are you SS done,1
teacher:SS right thumbs up shows me that you are SS done,1
teacher:Molly are you SS done,1
teacher:What should you be showing me,1
teacher:Does everybody notice that on their fifths and their tenths of the lines are the same,1
teacher:If I have my fifths who can count how many lines I have,1
teacher:Show me on your fingers,1
teacher:Brennan,1
teacher:Seth say it again,1
teacher:Youre going to prep it yourself,1
teacher:Fivefifths or Brennan what did you say;student:Fivefifths,1
teacher:What are you not going to cut;student:The dotted lines,1
teacher:24 1;student:No,1
teacher:Myra,1
teacher:Everything okay,1
teacher:Youre okay Dion,1
teacher:Daniel are you raising your hand for,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Emmy,1
teacher:Dean,1
teacher:All right got my answer,1
teacher:How many of you guys got 55,1
teacher:Everybody together work with your partners with your team,1
teacher:So fractions can equal a whole;student:I shared that SS of the rest of the fraction can be equal to the whole like any,1
teacher:Who remembers what a number line is,1
teacher:Reuben are you saying that it shows numbers in order;student:Shes like one two threes and fours,1
teacher:Yes are we ever going to have like 0 15 7;student:Yes,1
teacher:What are you going to cut,1
teacher:Now you guys told me that our tenths have the exact same amount of lines on them so can I count my tenths exactly like I did my fifths,1
teacher:Can I say 110 210 310 410 510;student:Yes,1
teacher:Eloise,1
teacher:Lets see lets go back to what we did two days ago and lets pull up some of those circles and see if theyre equal because our number line says they are equal right;student:First,1
teacher:SS right tell somebody next to you,1
teacher:Are those equal to each other,1
teacher:Lets say that together,1
teacher:Lets see here Seth,1
teacher:Do you guys know that one equals one;student:One,1
teacher:Stephen I havent heard a lot from you today,1
teacher:Lets say this together,1
teacher:You have twotenths;student:I have twotenths,1
teacher:You need a half;student:I need a half,1
teacher:You have everything,1
teacher:Not missing something,1
teacher:Holly are you missing anything,1
teacher:Does anyone have an extra half,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Solomon did you figure it out,1
teacher:Barbara,1
teacher:Who can answer that question,1
teacher:How;student:How,1
teacher:Yes Im skipping over a ton of tenths so are we going to have to add some lines;student:Because thats not an order,1
teacher:Somebody from table five can you tell,1
teacher:Can someone rephrase what Brennan said;student:We talked about that we have to add six more because we already have four lines and 64 is 10 so we decided that were gonna have to have six more lines,1
teacher:Shane,1
teacher:Onetenths;student:Onetenths,1
teacher:You guys notice that,1
teacher:Youre going to glue it where its supposed to go so am I going to glue my tenths on my whole;student:Yes,1
teacher:Neil,1
teacher:Am I going to glue my tenths on my fifths;student:No,1
teacher:Everyones done for right,1
teacher:Hold it in your hand say Hello pencil;student:Yes,1
teacher:Right now you are a ruler;student:Hello pencil,1
teacher:SS right has your pencil transformed;student:Right now you are a ruler,1
teacher:Shane just said something and Im wondering if anybody else noticed this,1
teacher:When you find another pair I want you to put one finger up in the air,1
teacher:When you find another pair I want you to put another finger up in the air and if you find a third pair I want you to put three fingers up,1
teacher:You already got your tenths written;student:Come on,1
teacher:Kyan read the problem,1
teacher:Angelica,1
teacher:Longer;student:Theyre like a little longer and the side and the base are not parallel like theyre a little,1
teacher:Knowing that could you have put a different number in your proportion,1
teacher:You get that X is equal to 102 is 102 85,1
teacher:You did this,1
teacher:Questions on that one,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Question on this one,1
teacher:Talk to your group,1
teacher:Is your answer juice,1
teacher:That makes sense,1
teacher:Am I done,1
teacher:Questions on this one,1
teacher:Read for me the paragraph under the coordinate plane,1
teacher:Dante,1
teacher:X Y easy right,1
teacher:Thats Where is 7,1
teacher:85 were on time right,1
teacher:Jeffrey,1
teacher:Camilla,1
teacher:Well this is 1800;student:After that I multiplied 120 by 15 which is 1800 and then I did 120 times X which is 100X,1
teacher:Youre done,1
teacher:We dont know how many are red or anything right,1
teacher:Is working together;student:I think its the part because like the whole is like how much you compare it for,1
teacher:Then did anyone simplify this first,1
teacher:Questions,1
teacher:Questions on that one,1
teacher:Figure it out with your partner,1
teacher:Write that down,1
teacher:Do you know,1
teacher:Tomas what are you doing,1
teacher:Did you read the whole problem;student:Because 50 is,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Jane,1
teacher:Do we know the part do we know the whole,1
teacher:Lynda,1
teacher:Okay yes if 100 of theSSis 120 right,1
teacher:Questions on this,1
teacher:How many of you feel like you have already reached our learning target for the day,1
teacher:Paige,1
teacher:Toby,1
teacher:Guy,1
teacher:It could be the front not necessarily just the front though right;student:A front of a shape,1
teacher:Dexter,1
teacher:Who wants to read the definition of a prism,1
teacher:Prism Tom,1
teacher:Polyhedron;student:Oh a prism is a poly,1
teacher:Okay read for me the definition of a pyramid,1
teacher:Grace,1
teacher:Matteo,1
teacher:The prism has the base which my hand is on plus do you see the base,1
teacher:If I go like this can I put it in my hand,1
teacher:If I pulled up this one the base is a pentagon the base of this is a pentagon but do you see the difference,1
teacher:Prism pyramid right,1
teacher:Ancient Egyptians,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Reed,1
teacher:Reed,1
teacher:Nash,1
teacher:Terry,1
teacher:Byron,1
teacher:Byron,1
teacher:Roland,1
teacher:Substitute a 10 in for M Reed,1
teacher:Isabelle,1
teacher:Raphael,1
teacher:Hows it going,1
teacher:How many of you drew a graph,1
teacher:You have a graph drawn;student:No no you dont,1
teacher:Reed,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Jeremy,1
teacher:What;student:Distance,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:Porter,1
teacher:It says to draw a graph right,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:You dont need the same,1
teacher:Ok Erik would you say that one more time to David and the rest of us,1
teacher:Jeff,1
teacher:More more;student:For some reason,1
teacher:Anyone else,1
teacher:Matt,1
teacher:Something still confuses Matt,1
teacher:Well what s wrong;student:He just doesn t want anybody to know what we re talking about,1
teacher:Is this still an issue,1
teacher:Or if you rolled one and then another does it matter;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Stephanie;student:If you want to roll  em tw if you want to roll  em one at a time or if you want to roll  em separate,1
teacher:Matt;student:Well it has one more possibility,1
teacher:Can you tell,1
teacher:Ankur;student:I go to write in order but,1
teacher:Let s hear from Ankur then we ll have Milin and um Michelle s yeah;student:Shh,1
teacher:Ankur;student:four,1
teacher:That might help Jeff and do you mind Matt,1
teacher:You heard that;student:Yeah if you do switch,1
teacher:Angela the same thing,1
teacher:And Jeff can come up,1
teacher:Ankur;student:No,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:You knew it wasn t fair;student:I just knew it wasn t fair,1
teacher:You thought player B had an advantage;student:I think that player B had an advantage,1
teacher:OK anyone else;student:So that s what I thought,1
teacher:Anyone else,1
teacher:Milin,1
teacher:Ankur,1
teacher:Angela;student:And they re not that commonly rolled,1
teacher:Magdalena,1
teacher:Ah Sarah,1
teacher:You didn t have a theory or did you,1
teacher:You thought it was fair at first,1
teacher:How many of you would like to be B;student:B,1
teacher:Amy,1
teacher:OK so you are telling me there are two ways you can get six three and three and four and two Is that what you re telling me;student:Like um six three and three or um four and two,1
teacher:OK Milin;student:We got a chart,1
teacher:How about you Michelle,1
teacher:Go ahead um Jeff;student:I made dots on the paper,1
teacher:Does it tell you how m see I m little um confused here because the the number in the side tell you how many times you get the number;student:Shows how many times you can get each number,1
teacher:You think its going to make it into eleven;student:Its going to make it into eleven,1
teacher:Okay Dawud said What number did Dawud just say;student:Six,1
teacher:You think six is going to go to ten;student:I think six is going to go to ten,1
teacher:Hold on he says its going to be more than thirteen;student:Its going to be twentyfour then thirtysix,1
teacher:Alright is everybody ready;student:Its going to be eight,1
teacher:Ariel thinks that the rule is any number that I put here  under this column  is  that right;student:And for five you would add eight,1
teacher:Alright would everyone hold on a second;student:Like the square is the  numbers going in like the triangle it goes into like a say a  factory and it comes out the triangle number,1
teacher:Okay Ariel go ahead;student:Let Ariel talk,1
teacher:Okay so did you hear what Ariel said;student:Square number and triangle number,1
teacher:Dawud could you tell us what Ariel said;student:No he talks too fast,1
teacher:Is that what you think;student:It keep on multiplying by four,1
teacher:Ariel,1
teacher:Lets try another one okay,1
teacher:Alright is everybody ready,1
teacher:Okay so does everyone see that when there is a one;student:One,1
teacher:You ready for the result,1
teacher:Okay heres my  rule you ready for it,1
teacher:You ready;student:Oh,1
teacher:Okay ready for it,1
teacher:That makes sense Angela;student:Yeah,1
teacher:So one would be go ahead Jeff;student:See,1
teacher:You mean the sum of seven;student:Well like like how it says that there s one two three four five six sevens that means there s six different possible ways to get it,1
teacher:And you can count them;student:Thirty six,1
teacher:Would it matter,1
teacher:The same numbers,1
teacher:Is there one last chart we re gonna show Milin,1
teacher:Anybody else;student:This you just have to roll the dice,1
teacher:Any questions for that group;student:You re welcome,1
teacher:And then we have one final question Jeff,1
teacher:Remember Stephanie s chart up here;student:Well,1
teacher:You like to see all the numbers;student:Because you see,1
teacher:I have one final question are you ready,1
teacher:What;student:Seven,1
teacher:You know the game;student:Guess my rule,1
teacher:Guess my rule,1
teacher:Milin;student:Bill has,1
teacher:Think of a rule that will  produce what you think the number for four  okay,1
teacher:O OK anybody else;student:Because like it s just it s however the luck is going,1
teacher:Again Mike please;student:No,1
teacher:You want to say it to the camera or to everybody,1
teacher:Who s talking;student:It s just for number eight,1
teacher:OK anybody else coming to help or are you doing it by yourself,1
teacher:Does anyone else have the formula for this,1
teacher:Jeff yeah you re working with Stephanie and Michelle and Mike is that right,1
teacher:Anybody want to say anything,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Do you understand what we are going to do,1
teacher:Can you listen;student:Guess my Rule,1
teacher:Can you listen to Milin please,1
teacher:This time we ve reversed it right,1
teacher:You ve got it,1
teacher:If you ve got it write it down and come show it to me would you,1
teacher:You have,1
teacher:You ve got an idea;student:I got an idea,1
teacher:OK um I think we really have come close to being out of time would anybody like to say anything about this,1
teacher:I gave you an equation right,1
teacher:Let me talk to everybody OK,1
teacher:OK all four of you are coming to explain this right,1
teacher:Now don t tell them your nice method of writing it OK,1
teacher:Do you remember what you said to me before you invented the nice way of writing it;student:Just tell them what we got for the written answer not like the code,1
teacher:OK wait a second can we get it quiet please because I want to hear what Michael is saying,1
teacher:What you just said,1
teacher:Do you want to say it to the camera,1
teacher:Sure you don t;student:Not really,1
teacher:Well later on if you want to but let s say it to the camera right now;student:That s easy,1
teacher:Yeah why don t you say that to the camera;student:When you minus this one from this one you get the multiplying number,1
teacher:That s what you had too isn t it;student:That s the code  square times square plus one equals triangle,1
teacher:OK does everybody understand that;student:That isn t very difficult If we knew what it was we just didn t put it down how it was supposed to be,1
teacher:What;student:We re done with it,1
teacher:You ve got 7 already,1
teacher:Say the first one again;student:And you d just get that moving to like 1 times 1 2 times 2 3 times 3 and 4 times 4,1
teacher:OK that s an interesting idea Amy Lynn and Bobby would you come and say your thing to the camera;student:We ve got another code,1
teacher:Why don t you talk this time,1
teacher:Who s doing the talking you doing the talking;student:This is the one for nine,1
teacher:We worked out numbers pairs of numbers that would make it true right,1
teacher:Matt,1
teacher:Why don t you see if you can find out and we can talk about that but I think maybe I propose not to do that today,1
teacher:Does it matter,1
teacher:OK are we ready to start sharing ideas;student:It s just whoever picked,1
teacher:How long does it take;student:Ow,1
teacher:Three minutes five minutes;student:Ah,1
teacher:It just sort of prolongs it is that all;student:OK,1
teacher:Did you like the problem,1
teacher:My my question is that did you change your mind about what you originally thought,1
teacher:But how many of you changed your mind about what you thought after you started playing it,1
teacher:Romina;student:Jeff and I thought that,1
teacher:Anybody else think it was fair before they started playing the game,1
teacher:Anyone else here think so,1
teacher:Amy,1
teacher:Did you change your mind,1
teacher:So that made you re rethink it;student:And player A only player A only won once,1
teacher:OK did you all hear what Mike said;student:I thought win because it more,1
teacher:Does it surprise you that when A won the scores were close;student:Yeah player B A won,1
teacher:Now does it surprise you that player A won one time here;student:And the fifth game player B won ten to six,1
teacher:But that you re saying that doesnt guarantee you win,1
teacher:Okay and so forth,1
teacher:It s one big secret;student:It s one big secret,1
teacher:Matt,1
teacher:OK we left that hanging a little bit and I think I m going to leave it hanging again today but it s a very interesting problem and it certainly looks like it might be impossible doesn t it;student:or you had to go into decimals or whatever,1
teacher:Okay and now then we in fact actually um Michelle whereyeah um I m sorry  Michelle R,1
teacher:And you left out one parenthesis do you see where you left it out,1
teacher:Michelle,1
teacher:Could I could I get some idea of how we re coming along here;student:What about me,1
teacher:You thought so too Michelle;student:At first,1
teacher:Oh ok  and Bobby and AmyLynn you re on what number 4;student:I only did one the first one,1
teacher:You found the secret;student:We found the secret,1
teacher:So you re saying this seven here is that correct;student:See seven if you add the five you take it away from there and one times two,1
teacher:Oh way hey can you come up let s erase this and come and show us OK;student:He means this doesn t go up by two what s in between it goes up by two,1
teacher:Matt have you completed that;student:Negative number,1
teacher:OK come and say that to the camera why don t you,1
teacher:OK whoever s going to talk needs the mike who s talking;student:I didn t figure it out but it has something to do with the prime numbers but,1
teacher:Three is rolled twice;student:And four is rolled,1
teacher:Ankur and Michelle you re on what problem;student:I want to see what our little pattern is,1
teacher:You think you would need the same,1
teacher:Okay so does that work;student:Times ten,1
teacher:Chris,1
teacher:Oneeighth,1
teacher:Thats winning in six games,1
teacher:Is that right,1
teacher:Thats whats left over;student:Its the same thing,1
teacher:Are you checking that this agreed with the number you found earlier;student:And that equals sixteen,1
teacher:So you  in the cases where you actually sort of got in and had to do the calculations had to sort of slog through the calculations in one way or another youre treating the last game as special and then youre looking at the possibilities that could lead up to it is that fair,1
teacher:Have you was it stated in the problem,1
teacher:Did you wonder what you would do if uh they werent equally matched,1
teacher:Uh youre looking at maybe a whole season of games right,1
teacher:The idea that one team might be better than the other;student:You just  you just change the bottom number cause,1
teacher:But would it be fair to  money most of the time;student:Some teams just dont do good  dont do well against the other teams because they take it for granted and then they play,1
teacher:Suppose the home team suppose people  some you know enough people thought the home team was twice as likely to win as the away team;student:Exactly,1
teacher:Are you sure;student:Yeah,1
teacher:How would you express  well the probabilities you wrote on the board were numbeTeacher right,1
teacher:Are you reading the fraction 216 as symbolizing two out of sixteen;student:One out of two,1
teacher:So now  thats how we looked at the probability thats how you looked at the probability of winning the series in exactly five games was that right and you got eight over thirtytwo,1
teacher:Is that right,1
teacher:So thats  the probability so lets  see where we are do we have all the alternative approaches out in the open so far,1
teacher:We want to win the World Series right;student:What we think  Um,1
teacher:Could I ask a simpleminded question;student:And then for two teams winning  its twosixteenths or oneeighth,1
teacher:So here you re looking  are you looking at it in your  are you imagining a two game series at this point;student:This is,1
teacher:So it would be two out of sixteen;student:Two to the n,1
teacher:Could you go through that a little more slowly;student:Sixteen plus sixteen,1
teacher:Is that right;student:Hmmmm,1
teacher:But is  does that complete the solution for this case,1
teacher:I just wrote down the possibilities,1
teacher:Are you saying that there are a couple of different ways of seeing it,1
teacher:Could we walk through all of them;student:Yeah there s a different way of approaching that problem,1
teacher:Just  three,1
teacher:Oh because the ones with two ones in them if they have three digits have one zero;student:Um,1
teacher:Are you saying for example that  that six comes up by adding;student:And they go into this category the ones that dont get anything added go into that one,1
teacher:And the whole triangle is built that way,1
teacher:It would be one of those ten;student:This combination would be to this  There should be out of part of these out of these ten,1
teacher:Are you saying that if the if the home team won three out of the exactly three out of the four then its in a position to win  if it wins the fifth game or;student:I dont know why but if you if you win three games for four thats the probability of winning in the fourth,1
teacher:So you didnt just pull them out of the air,1
teacher:four games,1
teacher:Right,1
teacher:Looks like theres a question on the table right;student:Like what are you,1
teacher:Do you see what Im saying,1
teacher:Does it come together,1
teacher:Does it make sense in any way,1
teacher:Do you understand,1
teacher:You all know that the World Series is played in seven games;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Did you know that Romina because I didnt know that,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:Yes;student:Can we factor this out,1
teacher:Whats the confusion;student:Were not uh exactly sure whats being asked here,1
teacher:Lets listen to what David has to say,1
teacher:Jessica,1
teacher:Did you all hear what Erik said,1
teacher:Erik do  you want to say that one more time,1
teacher:How  many heard what Erik said,1
teacher:How many  would like to hear it a second time,1
teacher:Is that good enough,1
teacher:Is that okay,1
teacher:Are you curious;student:If you say that,1
teacher:Am I wrong to wonder;student:Then you tell us  why and we dont know,1
teacher:Want to talk for a while and Ill join you in a couple of minutes;student:Like three games,1
teacher:Yeah but what would you do for the four game series;student:Youre adding that,1
teacher:Is that the only way,1
teacher:You mean that the A could be in one out of four places;student:It cant happen in the last one,1
teacher:And in each of those cases were the As in a different place  Are you taking the same product in the fractures;student:Yeah so it would be eight out of two hundred and fortythree that Team A  Team B would win,1
teacher:You are;student:Yes,1
teacher:Will there be a two thirds under the B at the beginning;student:Its gonna be the same,1
teacher:You mean exactly four games exactly five games exactly six games exactly seven games;student:What are the chances the World Series will be won in four games five games six games and seven games,1
teacher:Are you saying you would you get the same product with the two third in those different places,1
teacher:Wouldnt we want to compare that with the equally matched case see if theres a difference;student:Its always  its probably come up in the same  order,1
teacher:Two to   isnt that eight;student:third is eightytwo,1
teacher:Now what I remember here was that  it was like we  we chose to look at a simpler situation which is what happens in two games in a row right,1
teacher:Right,1
teacher:And  right,1
teacher:That way,1
teacher:Or Team B could win both games right,1
teacher:What;student:Then you add em together and you get seventytwo out of two fortythree,1
teacher:Does that work;student:Times five,1
teacher:Does it matter;student:Cause if N is a big number,1
teacher:Is that okay,1
teacher:So is this the table given to you,1
teacher:Student number three stand up and table three,1
teacher:So is this something that they asked you yesterday or you just  thought of,1
teacher:But if you think about the order of operations do you need any kind of  parentheses here;student:Plus three times three,1
teacher:Would you do  addition first or,1
teacher:X is the number that you start with;student:X plus three,1
teacher:So if I see it written this way then you think I would do first I would  add three and then I would multiply the result by three;student:X plus three times three equals Y,1
teacher:Huh;student:Why is it two,1
teacher:OK so you did the operations in this order  the order in which they were written;student:Five plus two is seven seven times three is twentyone,1
teacher:So is that another way you could do,1
teacher:How about you,1
teacher:T1 So you need that to avoid confusion here;student:Thats what our teacher did,1
teacher:Would you leave this rule the same way,1
teacher:This is your rule right,1
teacher:Say that one more time Romina;student:And then and then yeah exactly,1
teacher:Is that what they have here,1
teacher:Do you want an equals sign there;student:Thats just thats what it is,1
teacher:Five times three;student:Two plus three equals five  times three is eighteen,1
teacher:James Ariel is writing this number three can  you write the other;student:Three,1
teacher:Alright does everyone see what happens to ten;student:You go to put,1
teacher:Do you want another  problem,1
teacher:Do you think that theres another rule that we can have;student:Now we can take a break,1
teacher:Or do you  think that is the only rule we can get,1
teacher:And then you are telling me that you get to thirty;student:Ten eleven twelve then thirteen and then fourteen and then fifteen   and then for twentyfive,1
teacher:Do you want Ariel to help you;student:Then you will try to,1
teacher:Does it work for the others;student:One times two is two plus five  is seven and then we can up with,1
teacher:Have you guys talked about it;student:Yeah,1
teacher:OK would you like another challenge;student:Yeah,1
teacher:You are trying to find for twentyfive;student:I just got one thing,1
teacher:Ariel,1
teacher:Seventy six;student:Seventy six,1
teacher:What do you think James;student:If you follow  my rule  twentyfive times    oh wait a minute  so I must have  messed up somewhere because twentyfive times three is seventyfive  plus one is seventysix like I got up here,1
teacher:Does that make sense to you;student:I start off with one then add the next  number by three then add the next number by five then seven then  nine add odd number in that order,1
teacher:A thousand two hundred and fifty;student:What if I give a thousand two hundred and fifty,1
teacher:You add three and then you multiply  by three,1
teacher:Would you mind Jeff;student:I wrote that so you dont have to,1
teacher:Ankur;student:Extension,1
teacher:Isnt that what Jeff said,1
teacher:Are you impressed;student:Thats it,1
teacher:Thats another form isnt it;student:The addition rule in factorial notation,1
teacher:Is that the same thing;student:It s too confusing,1
teacher:It is;student:It is the same thing,1
teacher:Did you all very carefully check that arithmetic;student:We wrote that like that,1
teacher:You sure;student:Yeah all right,1
teacher:Did you check it;student:Yeah I guess,1
teacher:What do you think;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Is that foreboding,1
teacher:Would you like to know how to do that;student:the factorial,1
teacher:Would you like to know how to do the algebra of factorials,1
teacher:Ill just show you one thing that I know you know and Ill leave you to think about this because everyone is getting tired but lets just take something like this right,1
teacher:Six choose two right,1
teacher:Times two factorial right;student:Three fact four factorial times two factorial,1
teacher:And you know what six factorial is right;student:Mm hm,1
teacher:Go ahead Brian;student:I can just sit in the back and watch,1
teacher:Say it so Brian can follow it because he wasnt here for the earlier pizza discussion;student:Place,1
teacher:The Readers Digest version;student:No I just said like the Readers Digest version or something,1
teacher:What was that Ankur;student:Yeah,1
teacher:And now Im thinking of towers that are five tall,1
teacher:And were talking of those that have two reds;student:You can we just,1
teacher:Do you understand my question,1
teacher:You remember that;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Do you understand my question,1
teacher:Do you understand,1
teacher:Do you want that divided sign here;student:Yeah n n represents,1
teacher:But can I do that;student:Thats thats simplifying is great then you can,1
teacher:On that one;student:No,1
teacher:That s what I heard you say Jeff;student:Mm hm,1
teacher:Is the last one N N,1
teacher:Do you want to put it at the end;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Is that true;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Do you believe that,1
teacher:You all believe that;student:Yeah I believe so,1
teacher:No one could persuade you otherwise;student:Uhhuh,1
teacher:Can we get one in the middle there like n choose r;student:Mm hm,1
teacher:Nessa okay,1
teacher:Who could remember one,1
teacher:You added like place values;student:Yes,1
teacher:Melanie,1
teacher:Lee,1
teacher:We just want to leave a space to show whether its larger right,1
teacher:Did you write what I put on the board;student:Mr Parker can I please get help,1
teacher:We want each one to equal 18 right,1
teacher:Sixteen eighteenths,1
teacher:How many of you are familiar with either one of those words,1
teacher:Is there another one,1
teacher:Is there another definition for fractions,1
teacher:Have you ever heard of the word decomposing,1
teacher:Bennett,1
teacher:Okay Dominic;student:I think it means I dont know,1
teacher:Has anybody ever heard of an earthworm,1
teacher:Luis,1
teacher:I could fold this over correct,1
teacher:Numerator Josh;student:You also do the top,1
teacher:As long as I cut along this line here this should be half correct,1
teacher:Which is nine times four right,1
teacher:36;student:No,1
teacher:Can you make five sixth;student:I don t have any,1
teacher:Table three nobody from your table either,1
teacher:No way we could come up with a common denominator without multiplying these two together,1
teacher:Lincoln,1
teacher:The point of todays lesson was that you should be able to understand how to break things into pieces but isnt it just easier to do it mathematically,1
teacher:Avery,1
teacher:Yes;student:Wait,1
teacher:Can we use four,1
teacher:Can we use eight,1
teacher:Can we use 12;student:maybe,1
teacher:What about 16,1
teacher:What about 20;student:No,1
teacher:What about 24;student:No,1
teacher:What about 28;student:No,1
teacher:32;student:No,1
teacher:For this one were we able to take a shortcut,1
teacher:Finn its time for you to start talking up;student:No,1
teacher:Did I cut it into two Kleenex,1
teacher:Are these two Kleenexes,1
teacher:Do you think its 14,1
teacher:Did I make two cuts;student:Two,1
teacher:Talk about that;student:No,1
teacher:Did I make two cuts;student:Two,1
teacher:Ms Sadie stand up please,1
teacher:Please just tell everybody what you told me,1
teacher:Tell them not me,1
teacher:Ready set vote,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Have you even told them why,1
teacher:Have you tried to convince them at all,1
teacher:Is there anybody in here who feels so strongly that they are correct that they would be willing to make a wager with me,1
teacher:Go ahead Elliott,1
teacher:Are you willing to make the wager that you are correct,1
teacher:Can I go ahead and assume from your sheepishness now that thats a no,1
teacher:Did I make two cuts;student:No,1
teacher:Okay but to make 14 dont I need to have two cuts;student:One fourth,1
teacher:Talk to your table,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Mr Finn you say yes to that question,1
teacher:Is this two Kleenexes,1
teacher:When I took my scissors and cut this in half did I cut it into two Kleenexes,1
teacher:Whats Cecilia,1
teacher:How about size are they the same size,1
teacher:This ones quite a bit bigger right,1
teacher:When I cut that original Kleenex into two pieces those pieces are not wholes are they,1
teacher:Nobody in there has a problem with the way I wrote this question;student:I have problems,1
teacher:Two halves right;student:Two Halves,1
teacher:If I only have one of these pieces so if I were to cut it in I use that one and I still have this one left do I still have a Kleenex,1
teacher:Anybody want to bet me,1
teacher:How many of you think that I have 12,1
teacher:How many of you think that this is half;student:They do,1
teacher:You just said that what I did was I took a whole Kleenex and I cut it in two pieces and if I have one its 12 right,1
teacher:Four halves;student:Four halfs,1
teacher:Please quietly as a table talk about what this is,1
teacher:One whole right;student:One whole,1
teacher:Smart boy,1
teacher:You guys have no problem with this question the way I wrote it,1
teacher:But could I do it this way,1
teacher:Mr Josh,1
teacher:Im missing my numerators right;student:A numerator,1
teacher:Jack,1
teacher:Miss Laurie huh,1
teacher:No wonder Jesus beat you huh,1
teacher:Did everybody hear what she said,1
teacher:What did she say Truman;student:Yes,1
teacher:And thats okay because it was a little quiet please repeat what you said,1
teacher:So weve been practicing multiplying our two denominators together right,1
teacher:Mr Max,1
teacher:The answer is could we do my way,1
teacher:I think what youre looking for is youre still looking for a common denominator right;student:By getting a smaller by cutting it into by cutting it into more than three pieces but less than 36,1
teacher:Julian,1
teacher:Does it matter what your common denominator is as long as your two numbers are multiples of it,1
teacher:Because is three a factor of 12,1
teacher:If you happen to get lucky and have a fraction that is half which four is half of eight right,1
teacher:I had to do multiplication on both sides of my equation right,1
teacher:How many of you have number three done,1
teacher:Sixteens bigger than nine;student:Sixteens bigger than nine,1
teacher:Did you just say we times;student:So how we get 24 is we times,1
teacher:Anybody,1
teacher:Ladies and gentlemen remember me teaching you factors and multiples and saying how important theyre going to be,1
teacher:Is it the only common denominator we could use,1
teacher:How many of you think the answer is yes,1
teacher:Is there another denominator we could use instead of 24 and get the right answer,1
teacher:Does 8 go into 6,1
teacher:Did you guys find another one,1
teacher:So you guys say 16,1
teacher:Can we use 16,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you think we can use 16,1
teacher:So table three you did a good job of understanding that if we multiply eight times two we get 16 right,1
teacher:Is there any groups that have found it,1
teacher:Did any of you at this table take an even quicker shortcut,1
teacher:48 so we could have used 48 right;student:48,1
teacher:Do you have any questions about what Miss Polly you just did,1
teacher:Noah,1
teacher:Mr Parker this work every time,1
teacher:Youve already done it without multiplying your denominators together,1
teacher:Melanie,1
teacher:Did it work;student:Six,1
teacher:Gabriella are you waiting for something,1
teacher:So why are we not using the pattern blocks to solve it;student:No,1
teacher:You did,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Explain to them,1
teacher:So explain it to him;student:They all got it,1
teacher:Yes yes so are they equivalent,1
teacher:You now realize;student:I now realize,1
teacher:Doesnt this look the same,1
teacher:So you went down,1
teacher:Are these the same,1
teacher:Are they the same size;student:No,1
teacher:We cut this guy in half right,1
teacher:Why cant we add them together,1
teacher:But we dont add the bottom so its probably just two twelfths right,1
teacher:Shouldn t our answer be two 16th,1
teacher:If I have two thirds and I have four sixth if I put my triangles on top of my rhombuses does it work,1
teacher:When you think youve got it  raise your hand and I Mr Parker come tell you whether you got it right or not,1
teacher:So you see that twofourths is equal to twofourths,1
teacher:Good but can you do it without multiplying by four and two,1
teacher:That equals four right;student:Times two,1
teacher:Marie you got it,1
teacher:So do you see how we get the same answer,1
teacher:You think you get it,1
teacher:So then one third and one third are they the same,1
teacher:All right who else feels like they need a lot of help,1
teacher:Okay so the rest of you nobody feels like they need a coach just somebody to work with,1
teacher:Three;student:I picked three triangles,1
teacher:Count them again,1
teacher:Okay so do you think they have it right;student:I was trying to check it on my paper but I couldn t make sense of it,1
teacher:You dont know;student:I don t know,1
teacher:Is that a number sentence for what you have in the blues;student:Two thirds,1
teacher:Well is four sixth the same thing as two thirds,1
teacher:Anybody else feel like they really need help,1
teacher:Okay Miss Robin come to the front;student:Robin,1
teacher:Do we know how many cuts I did,1
teacher:Did I make any additional cuts,1
teacher:Now I have a complete sentence that makes sense right,1
teacher:Is this a complete sentence,1
teacher:Is everybody understanding what a number sentence is,1
teacher:Getters please hold up a red trapezoid,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you can tell me what fraction that red trapezoid represents of our whole,1
teacher:A donkey,1
teacher:Yes have we completed it,1
teacher:Is that a complete sentence,1
teacher:Is that a correct complete sentence;student:Yes,1
teacher:Is it true,1
teacher:Does onehalf plus onehalf equal one whole hexagon;student:Yes,1
teacher:Talk to your teammates about what youre doing,1
teacher:If Javier or Tanner or Daniel doesnt get it is it really good Diana does,1
teacher:Hey are we talking about this or are we just doing this;student:I said rhombuses,1
teacher:If Seth is not talking to him about it is that helping Simon to learn any of this information,1
teacher:What about now;student:I flew like a bird,1
teacher:Aiden if you dont understand what somebody is doing should you be asking them questions;student:No,1
teacher:Even though it is a complete sentence does it make sense the way its written,1
teacher:Is that a complete sentence,1
teacher:Is it a complete sentence,1
teacher:You dont think it is either,1
teacher:Because its the wrong answer,1
teacher:Do you think that is a complete sentence,1
teacher:You say yes,1
teacher:One by show of hands who thinks that is a complete sentence,1
teacher:Raise your hand,1
teacher:you said it was and now your hand is down,1
teacher:Now Addie you changed your mind,1
teacher:Who thinks it is not a complete sentence,1
teacher:But is that the right answer to complete that sentence;student:Because without an answer its not wholly complete,1
teacher:Do you think its a complete sentence;student:No,1
teacher:Is it a complete sentence,1
teacher:If I hear you right what youre saying is its a complete sentence its just an incorrect complete sentence;student:So an incorrect answer,1
teacher:Blake read me that sentence out loud please;student:What,1
teacher:Is it a good sentence;student:Yes,1
teacher:Have you asked any questions yet;student:Yes,1
teacher:All right Anybody needs more time with this or do we think weve all got a pretty good grasp of these first three,1
teacher:What shape Only Tanner,1
teacher:Does anybody have any questions how I got those,1
teacher:Triangles right;student:Triangle,1
teacher:Who havent I heard from,1
teacher:I need three of them right;student:Oh yes you need three,1
teacher:So if I have three of them do I have one whole,1
teacher:Do you know what youre doing,1
teacher:Okay so could you make me a number sentence with what youre seeing in front of you,1
teacher:Is that one of each,1
teacher:Now can you make a number sentence of that,1
teacher:Now can you make me a number sentence of that,1
teacher:Mr Blake,1
teacher:Denominator;student:You never added the denominator,1
teacher:That thing;student:Because if you add the denominator,1
teacher:I got it right right,1
teacher:Talk to your table first,1
teacher:Daniel,1
teacher:Walker;student:How many pieces we need,1
teacher:Jessica,1
teacher:How many pieces we actually have right;student:That you have two pieces,1
teacher:Am I holding up one whole,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you think that that is threesixth;student:Yes,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you think that that is onesixth,1
teacher:Do you think we are doing what we are supposed to be doing when we are talking in groups,1
teacher:Diana,1
teacher:Now confused yet,1
teacher:Onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth right,1
teacher:So you think its an incomplete sentence because of that;student:He doesnt have,1
teacher:Using rhombuses who thinks they have our final number sentence that we are going to start with today,1
teacher:Two halves right;student:Two halves,1
teacher:Talk as a table,1
teacher:Leia lets have Corbins sharing his thinking first,1
teacher:Lena your turn;student:Why do you,1
teacher:So how many of you by show of hands think that you understand why it is but cant explain it,1
teacher:Explaining your math thinking isnt always easy is it,1
teacher:So who thinks that they can;student:I can explain it,1
teacher:Melissa are you trying this because it doesnt look so,1
teacher:It was like there was a hidden piece;student:You open the pieces that you cut in half and then there are four pieces,1
teacher:Talk as your table do I have a complete sentence on the board;student:Yes,1
teacher:I dont have an answer right;student:You dont have an answer,1
teacher:Who sees something other than twofourths,1
teacher:Raise your hand,1
teacher:Tell them I already know,1
teacher:Because they are what;student:Because theyre adding,1
teacher:What is it,1
teacher:If were adding its got to be twofourths right,1
teacher:Huh;student:Because they  the same,1
teacher:To the whole group,1
teacher:So,1
teacher:Think Lola,1
teacher:Id be eating the same amount as that right;student:Twofourths,1
teacher:But does it look the same,1
teacher:Can you cut the same amount up another way that is equal,1
teacher:Can you do it another way,1
teacher:When you think you have done what I asked please raise your hand,1
teacher:Raise it up I want to see who sees twofourths,1
teacher:You have halves here is there another way with another shape you can make the same amount with a different size shape,1
teacher:Raise your hand if twofourths is what you see raise your hand,1
teacher:What you should currently have in your first circle is this correct,1
teacher:This is one whole Kleenex as far as you know correct,1
teacher:Because if I just took this first one and I cut it right down the middle I mean this isnt going to be perfect because Im just ripping it right now but if I cut it right down the middle do I have the same thing,1
teacher:Now this is why I wanted to trick you a little bit because when they were both together it made it look like I only did one cut right;student:Two,1
teacher:Raise your hand dont blurt it out,1
teacher:Okay you all have the red circled out right,1
teacher:Talk to your table mates,1
teacher:Lets say there were 10 of those yellow ones could you still figure out that they were fourths,1
teacher:Could you still figure out they were fourths even if you had 10 of them,1
teacher:Luis,1
teacher:Did everybody hear what Luis just said,1
teacher:Three out of the four right;student:Threefourths,1
teacher:You tell me is it;student:Is this,1
teacher:Dominic your hand is up what,1
teacher:Does everybody understand that;student:It would equal that when you added these three together because theyre equals three but you never add the denominator,1
teacher:One out of four or onefourth okay,1
teacher:Who sees twofourths,1
teacher:Almost but are you missing a piece,1
teacher:Many of you used this color and you came up with a half right,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you think you got it,1
teacher:Everybody,1
teacher:My predicate is the whole thing right,1
teacher:Now its also pointed out that we need a capital do we have one,1
teacher:And punctuation do we have a form of punctuation;student:Yes,1
teacher:How about this,1
teacher:Do I have a complete sentence on the board,1
teacher:Simon no;student:No,1
teacher:Is there a period,1
teacher:What do you think Tanner do I have my complete sentence now,1
teacher:Im missing a subject right,1
teacher:Would that be a complete sentence,1
teacher:Daniel,1
teacher:Have I written a number sentence on the board,1
teacher:Okay and an equal sign right;student:Plus plus,1
teacher:Is that a number sentence,1
teacher:Leia,1
teacher:Corbin,1
teacher:Addie,1
teacher:Is that a sentence I am a dog,1
teacher:Wow you guys are doing good at this I wasnt sure if you guys would pick this up did you get it,1
teacher:Get it;student:Oh,1
teacher:Get it,1
teacher:Six right;student:Six,1
teacher:Denominator right;student:Denominator,1
teacher:We had three right,1
teacher:This is what we actually see with the blue shapes correct;student:Onehalf,1
teacher:Do I now have a complete sentence,1
teacher:Mr Dominic stand up please,1
teacher:Sounds good but let me ask this does it have to be addition,1
teacher:Diana you dont know what a number sentence is,1
teacher:I like it but do we have to have digits;student:A number sentence to me is an equation of multiple digits to make a new number,1
teacher:What does that say,1
teacher:What does that say,1
teacher:What does it say Ashley,1
teacher:Is that a sentence,1
teacher:Walker,1
teacher:Do you,1
teacher:Alright Mr George,1
teacher:You think you can,1
teacher:One slice right;student:One,1
teacher:Multiplied;student:And then I multiply,1
teacher:Good thats all last night was right right;student:Because whatever you do to the bottom you have to do to the top,1
teacher:So obviously here theyve given us the top so does it work in reverse,1
teacher:Whatever you do to the top you have to do to the bottom,1
teacher:We had to multiply by three right,1
teacher:Two were we missing a denominator on number five;student:Two,1
teacher:Can you still use multiplication,1
teacher:One and 56 right;student:One and 56,1
teacher:Is that something you guys know,1
teacher:Easily,1
teacher:No its not when you generally think about right,1
teacher:What about three,1
teacher:Is there anything we can multiply by three,1
teacher:How about four;student:No,1
teacher:Have you eaten half,1
teacher:Oooh you all say that there is something we can multiply by four;student:Yes,1
teacher:But I said one half isnt the numerator in ONE half one,1
teacher:Delilah,1
teacher:Ava,1
teacher:You ended up with 412 on the 13;student:That would be 412,1
teacher:Haley does that make sense,1
teacher:Haley does that make more sense,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:So from the talking I hear Im assuming that we have our answer,1
teacher:Is this one feeling easier than the last one,1
teacher:And 12 dont fit because 15 dont fit into a 12 do they;student:That one worked and those are 15,1
teacher:Matthew;student:No,1
teacher:Okay so you think it is 910;student:Yes because,1
teacher:You think that tenths is the denominator that we need to convert to right now,1
teacher:Did anybody use the multiply the denominators trick,1
teacher:How many people feel like their comfort zone their jam is really looking at those fraction circle pieces,1
teacher:Alreya,1
teacher:Good to find equivalent fractions thats exactly what we did in yesterdays lesson right;student:To find equivalent fractions,1
teacher:I have to eat two pieces of pizza right;student:Two pieces of pizza,1
teacher:Emiliano,1
teacher:Multiply by two right;student:Times it by two,1
teacher:Fancy huh,1
teacher:That would be a parts of a set right;student:Set,1
teacher:Lets rewrite onetenth here and the first thing you need to ask yourself is does it have any wholes,1
teacher:So think of the examples that we just used parts of a set or parts of a whole,1
teacher:But is that our whole group,1
teacher:But Ive taught it already Jessica,1
teacher:Ones;student:Ones,1
teacher:Easy right,1
teacher:Kim,1
teacher:Yes sir,1
teacher:And if we have three parts out of 10 of a piece of pizza do we have a whole pizza,1
teacher:Now is it possible to have a decimal where we do have wholes,1
teacher:First off we have to separate our wholes from our parts right,1
teacher:We have one right;student:One,1
teacher:And then is that decimal still gonna look the exact same way as the decimal up here,1
teacher:Deneli question,1
teacher:Isaiah,1
teacher:A lot of like a whole;student:A lot of like a whole,1
teacher:Now Brody Im actually glad you gave me that example because so far weve really focused a lot on parts of wholes right,1
teacher:Mr Brody,1
teacher:Is that it,1
teacher:Theres another one,1
teacher:We did this yesterday in class right,1
teacher:Who havent heard from yet,1
teacher:Are there any that we missed,1
teacher:Well did we just prove that 30 has a plethora more than two,1
teacher:All right any questions about your homework,1
teacher:Remember how I said it is always okay to not know but its not okay to,1
teacher:Yes Areya a question,1
teacher:So for like this one here that you did so to get from four to eight you multiply by two right,1
teacher:That means you must have learned yesterday during the lesson I taught huh,1
teacher:Now if you recall when Mrs Cals class was in here last week because she was out I talked about fractions and decimals as a whole right,1
teacher:Does anybody remember what that was,1
teacher:We talked about how do you remember this that a lot of you thought that this is what the answer should have been that one half should look like that as a decimal,1
teacher:Alex,1
teacher:Onetenth is a much better name for it but one out of 10 is accurate right,1
teacher:On the left side;student:When you have to square anything on this side like right there on this side,1
teacher:Isaiah,1
teacher:Morgan,1
teacher:I went over and helped these gentlemen  use our fraction circle pieces and once you really set the pieces out how much sense did it make,1
teacher:Claire,1
teacher:Remember is it okay if you did yours the other direction,1
teacher:Does this fit our pattern of one times three is three and three times five is 15,1
teacher:Charles,1
teacher:Now number one read the directions for number one,1
teacher:Please Matt,1
teacher:Can someone else read this directions for number one Laura,1
teacher:When you said multiply the numerators and denominators it starts to sound like numerator times denominator and thats not what you mean is it,1
teacher:Awesome Laura;student:Mine is the algorithm for multiplying fractions as numerator times numerator equals numerator and denominator times denominator,1
teacher:But you dont have to change it but thats Ava,1
teacher:Read that again;student:First you multiply the two numerators and the two denominators and into products to make them a fraction,1
teacher:So instead of saying The two numerators and the two denominators it could end up being that theres three you know what Im saying,1
teacher:All right so today what we are going to be working on is were going to be adding and subtracting fractions that dont have the same denominator okay;student:Never mind,1
teacher:Do you remember doing that,1
teacher:Ari,1
teacher:Audrey,1
teacher:28 is the same as 14 right,1
teacher:Josh,1
teacher:Can I show you what I saw from some people,1
teacher:Can I tell you guys something,1
teacher:Can I just tell you something,1
teacher:Annabelle,1
teacher:Ava,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:Part of that is doing it correctly right,1
teacher:Any questions about that,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:When you are making a model for 34 times 23 should yours be a rectangle that s shaded then,1
teacher:Audrey,1
teacher:Claire,1
teacher:Yes did you do it this way;student:We need to draw the same,1
teacher:Christian,1
teacher:Michael,1
teacher:Now can I show you what some of you were doing;student:You look at 34 and 23 and then when they come together it makes a rectangle,1
teacher:Jackson,1
teacher:Is that correct,1
teacher:This is comfortable learning,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Because thats a 12 and a 13 pink and orange,1
teacher:So you did 112 plus 112 and you got 1012,1
teacher:Hannah,1
teacher:You know how I feel about being able to describe what you did though right;student:So 12 I did I dont know how to describe it,1
teacher:Matthew,1
teacher:I think it would be good for us to do a couple more of this what do you guys think,1
teacher:How do what;student:Ms  how do you do the strategy of it again,1
teacher:That Hannah was describing,1
teacher:Just have them next to each other because were adding 13 plus 14 right,1
teacher:412;student:412,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Does that make more sense,1
teacher:Matthew did you get it,1
teacher:Owen did you get it,1
teacher:Can you guys look at me for a moment,1
teacher:Just can I clarify;student:Okay so I laid out the pink piece and the orange piece and then,1
teacher:Can you say that again a little louder,1
teacher:Ari,1
teacher:You could fit one fraction into the other couldnt you,1
teacher:Green,1
teacher:All right does that make sense now;student:Okay purple it is,1
teacher:Haley does that makes sense;student:Yes,1
teacher:Purple;student:Its purple,1
teacher:Did that work with purple,1
teacher:Say that again,1
teacher:You see the difference there,1
teacher:Maybe we shouldnt have gone to  before we had the answer should we,1
teacher:So you see if your answer is reasonable right;student:We estimate so when we do get our answer we can see if its really correct,1
teacher:Okay so have you been using the the fraction circle pieces,1
teacher:Have you been using them,1
teacher:The last one we had What was the last problem we had,1
teacher:Is that something you guys  fractions,1
teacher:12 plus 48 so did you guy get that,1
teacher:Actually how about you solve this first,1
teacher:Mark do you have your answer,1
teacher:Ava,1
teacher:Oh wheres the confidence from my class,1
teacher:Are you asking about this one;student:So like if the decimal when its like two or one lets just say that was,1
teacher:May I see it please,1
teacher:How many of you think the answer is equal to,1
teacher:One,1
teacher:Miss Laurie,1
teacher:George,1
teacher:Mr Josh,1
teacher:Mr Julian has the right answer does anybody else,1
teacher:So of you four how many of you were right on your initial guess,1
teacher:Now do you see why I say never guess,1
teacher:How many of you want to see how to do this,1
teacher:Max,1
teacher:Robin,1
teacher:Have you noticed that I keep saying that over and over again,1
teacher:Do you think thats gonna be a big part of fourth grade;student:Yes,1
teacher:So do you think theyre mildly important,1
teacher:Okay and weve explained why right;student:Do to the top you must do to the bottom,1
teacher:How many of you think the answer is less than,1
teacher:You all know why we do both of those things,1
teacher:Two,1
teacher:Raise them up,1
teacher:You did;student:I got it,1
teacher:Gaby did you get this one right,1
teacher:Onefourth,1
teacher:Deneli,1
teacher:Isnt that fancy;student:Thats cool,1
teacher:So the way to think of it is onefourth of 1 is a quarter right,1
teacher:Its what,1
teacher:Is it what;student:The whole dollar is actually kind of,1
teacher:Alreya,1
teacher:Yes maam,1
teacher:George you ready,1
teacher:Max You ready,1
teacher:So you did hear me,1
teacher:How many of you think the answer is greater than,1
teacher:Raise your hands high,1
teacher:One two Laurie is your hand up,1
teacher:Who can repeat what Laurie just told me,1
teacher:I have five people can repeat what Laurie literally just said which was the right answer,1
teacher:Malaria,1
teacher:Hernan,1
teacher:Eight or is two a multiple of four;student:Eight,1
teacher:Now do you see that twofourths is bigger than one fourth,1
teacher:Are there any questions,1
teacher:Jack,1
teacher:Remember when Truman came up and circled 40 yesterday,1
teacher:Okay let me see real quick by show of hands how many of you are completely lost and dont understand what to do,1
teacher:Oneninth;student:Oneninth,1
teacher:Thats number two,1
teacher:Mr Jack do you understand where 24 is coming from,1
teacher:Do you understand why were using 24,1
teacher:Thats it I have four people can explain why were using 24,1
teacher:Talk as your tables,1
teacher:Talk,1
teacher:Perfect because if we take a pizza that has eight slices and then a pizza has three slices and we add slices we keep going until we get to 24 right,1
teacher:Noah,1
teacher:Is everybody listening to my directions,1
teacher:So now ladies and gentlemen is it clear to see what the answer should have been,1
teacher:So if we change the total number of pieces were also changing the number of pieces we care about right,1
teacher:What did she say,1
teacher:Michelle,1
teacher:Alreya,1
teacher:Raise your hand,1
teacher:Truman,1
teacher:Weve eaten one half of the pizza right;student:Onehalf,1
teacher:And that fraction is written like this correct,1
teacher:Well guess what,1
teacher:but do you know why,1
teacher:So why do whatever we do to the bottom do we do to the to the top,1
teacher:Because if you cut the whole pizza one extra time are we changing just the amount we didnt eat,1
teacher:Are we changing just this part,1
teacher:Are we changing just the part that we did eat;student:No,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Evan;student:Yes,1
teacher:Isabelle,1
teacher:So youre saying we just multiply both of these by two;student:Is it twofourths because we multiplied the top number by two and the bottom number by two,1
teacher:Lets only worry about parts because the questions youre asking involve parts and wholes and right now I just want to focus on what happens if we only have parts all right,1
teacher:If I take the number two and I divide it by three which is what we would do because thats what a fraction is right,1
teacher:So now ladies and gentlemen is that true;student:10,1
teacher:So hang on hang on Deneli let me stop you for just a sec does it matter more about the number of zeros or where the decimal is,1
teacher:Does that zero matter,1
teacher:If I add a zero here is it still four;student:Yes,1
teacher:If I had a zero here is it still four,1
teacher:So with whole numbers I can add zeros on either side and it doesnt change anything right;student:Yes,1
teacher:Weve established that right,1
teacher:We say it is as four hundredths correct;student:Zero and four hundredths,1
teacher:Tati,1
teacher:Did you just say point;student:Zero point four hundredths,1
teacher:Zero and four hundredths;student:Zero and four hundredths,1
teacher:Is that four,1
teacher:Turn to your tables and tell your table mates if you think thats true or not,1
teacher:Is it or isnt it,1
teacher:How many of you think that that is true,1
teacher:So using the skill we learned yesterday you think you can prove that;student:I multiplied by ten to the 4 and then multiplied ten by the hundred,1
teacher:Theres too much zeros too many zeros;student:Its not four because theres too much zeros where the four is,1
teacher:So thats exactly what we did yesterday right,1
teacher:But yet youre telling me that that ones not worth four;student:Yeah,1
teacher:And so does it matter how many we add,1
teacher:You do huh;student:Yes,1
teacher:Isnt it the same thing,1
teacher:Yes because does it matter how many zeros we have to the left of the decimal;student:Yes,1
teacher:Decimal moved over one place and were only dealing with zeros right,1
teacher:Its four yes its four now is that the way that you write the number four;student:Four,1
teacher:Remember we had this discussion at the beginning of the year,1
teacher:But the thing is when you have the number four wholes are there any parts,1
teacher:So we all know that thats the number four right,1
teacher:Mr Jonathan,1
teacher:Mr Jonathan,1
teacher:So look at that doesnt that look similar to what we just did just in reverse,1
teacher:It cant be four still cant it,1
teacher:They dont count because theyre not placeholders right;student:Because the zeros dont count,1
teacher:It doesnt matter how many I put right;student:Yeah it doesnt matter,1
teacher:What;student:Four,1
teacher:I have the exact same number of zeros here that I have here correct,1
teacher:I said are they the same,1
teacher:Alreya,1
teacher:Are our denominators,1
teacher:Yes sir,1
teacher:So do we have any wholes,1
teacher:So think about pizzas if we have if it needs 10 slices to make one whole pizza and we have eight of them do we have a whole pizza,1
teacher:No we dont right;student:Uhuh,1
teacher:All right so the first one was pretty easy right,1
teacher:But lets hear it Miss Tati,1
teacher:Ah did you hear what Tati just said;student:Because you need ten tenths to make one whole and five is half of ten,1
teacher:Four right;student:Four,1
teacher:Is this fraction the same thing as this decimal,1
teacher:Two right;student:Two,1
teacher:What about this one,1
teacher:What about this one;student:Yep,1
teacher:What about this one;student:Yep,1
teacher:What about this one;student:Yes,1
teacher:Any one of those would work right;student:Yes,1
teacher:Ms Deneli question,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Theyre not equal when were dealing with whole numbers right,1
teacher:Remember I said I would steal your money Ill give you four you give me 40,1
teacher:Is 1000 the same as 100;student:No,1
teacher:Of pizza right;student:40 slices,1
teacher:Leslie,1
teacher:We want to eat four slices of pizza right;student:Four slices,1
teacher:Theyre not right,1
teacher:Anybody want to do it,1
teacher:The rule tells us why right,1
teacher:Its just not reduced correct,1
teacher:Well its kind of hard to imagine because thats so big right,1
teacher:Six;student:Six,1
teacher:Deneli;student:10,1
teacher:Kim,1
teacher:Alex,1
teacher:So those are the same right,1
teacher:Are those equal,1
teacher:By themselves;student:No,1
teacher:But what about four tenths and 40 hundredths,1
teacher:Remember how we said level 3 is I dont understand what Im doing every once in a while and 2 is I get it but it helps me if were going through it step by step  and one is I have no idea what Im doing,1
teacher:Do you,1
teacher:Talk to your team not me lets go,1
teacher:You have three different other strategies;student:No I have like three different other strategies,1
teacher:Is this a six,1
teacher:They think youre going to count up by one every time;student:That number one because  using because some people think youre counting up by,1
teacher:So I want to say that Can I say that out louder guys;student:When you know how to do multiplication its easier to do fractions when youre trying to find,1
teacher:Its memorized;student:Its memorized,1
teacher:Division,1
teacher:Alicia;student:I multiplied two and got a six and then I added both of those together which would give me 119 which equals 1 and 29,1
teacher:You guys ready to learn another strategy,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:Give me a thumbs up if you feel confident with the multiple skipcounting strategy,1
teacher:A thumbs down if you dont feel confident,1
teacher:Thumbs to the side if youre kind of in the middle,1
teacher:How about this;student:I only use Robs strategy,1
teacher:Does that sound good,1
teacher:Yes Daniel,1
teacher:None;student:None,1
teacher:You know;student:I know that strategy,1
teacher:What questions do you have about this strategy,1
teacher:Are there any fractions that youve drawn,1
teacher:Okay Im going to give you some other options could you measure the volume of the gingerbread house with mini marshmallows,1
teacher:Luis what do you think;student:Yes,1
teacher:You guess;student:Yes I guess,1
teacher:You dont know;student:Because I dont know,1
teacher:Chloe,1
teacher:Do you want to look at the items to see,1
teacher:Okay hold your marker up after youre done writing your thoughts and youre ready to share with a learning partner,1
teacher:Turn to a learning partner share which of the items you would use to measure volume and why,1
teacher:Smarties,1
teacher:You dont know;student:Theyre more close to a square,1
teacher:They can stack;student:and theyre probably going to be the most accurate,1
teacher:Is that the shark,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Help me count by 4s,1
teacher:Four,1
teacher:Is there any fractions that youve drawn that have the same denominator,1
teacher:Stand up if youve used this strategy before multiplying two denominators together,1
teacher:Caleb I want to know from you is this a strategy that everyone in fourth grade learned or just some kids,1
teacher:Just some kids;student:Some kids,1
teacher:Is 79  69 139,1
teacher:Who changed this fraction,1
teacher:Who changed it into a mixed number,1
teacher:Hey Marianne how are you doing,1
teacher:Good;student:Good,1
teacher:Do we need to change any of the numbers that are being multiplied,1
teacher:Go ahead and What do you think,1
teacher:Three,1
teacher:Harper,1
teacher:Did you find it,1
teacher:Do you need help getting started,1
teacher:Did you find the point into the sailboat;student:Oh my God what a surprise,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Ellie did you get all of your points,1
teacher:These are your first two points,1
teacher:Denominators need to be the same so what you wrote here,1
teacher:You know what,1
teacher:Do you see any fractions in this bottom part of the denominator,1
teacher:You want to use quick common denominator,1
teacher:Five and six;student:Six and five,1
teacher:Give me a thumbs up if you prefer the multiple strategy,1
teacher:Give me a thumbs up if you want to try quick common denominator in the next problem,1
teacher:Hows this table doing,1
teacher:Is this your common denominator,1
teacher:For this problem;student:For this problem,1
teacher:Is this the problem were working on,1
teacher:What if you didnt have a ruler or a meterstick,1
teacher:Is that right,1
teacher:Have you used the multiplication table before;student:Whats the other  9 and your whole number in there,1
teacher:How are you doing today,1
teacher:Not so good,1
teacher:circles,1
teacher:You know what,1
teacher:Hows it going,1
teacher:Can I take a look,1
teacher:Can I show you a tool you can use;student:See thats easy,1
teacher:Do you see a zero on the page,1
teacher:Jackson,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Hermione,1
teacher:So you say the ratio of East fans to West fans is 23 all right,1
teacher:What is your responsibility,1
teacher:Roge does that make sense,1
teacher:You know what I mean,1
teacher:These two;student:It doesnt work there,1
teacher:Whats something  Yes times five right,1
teacher:Uploading a file okay,1
teacher:Vince,1
teacher:Lisa,1
teacher:Did you do times five,1
teacher:You click on Investigation 3 and then its the last one right here okay,1
teacher:Whats that,1
teacher:Yes;student:They all have,1
teacher:Serena,1
teacher:The ratio of does anyone remember how to write those,1
teacher:Ian,1
teacher:What else Rebecca,1
teacher:Is this in the simplest form,1
teacher:Like three minutes I dont want to share up yet because people are listening right,1
teacher:Clay youre ready,1
teacher:What about Team 2,1
teacher:Rebecca,1
teacher:Thats taking Paulinas thinking a little bit further which I love is that if these were each 10 then there would be five of them right;student:One way to  60 then 50 to 60 is 10 so you dont get to 90 so maybe we dont,1
teacher:50 60 70 80 90 Roge saying because theres only four blocks it has to be a little bit more than 10 then its probably 62 or 63 or 64 somewhere there right,1
teacher:Oh yes yes no worries can I keep going and then well come back to your thinking;student:It might be wrong but the first one might correct with 90,1
teacher:Or was your hand up,1
teacher:Sorry Im not it was,1
teacher:Like how could we write 31100 okay,1
teacher:Rebecca,1
teacher:Someone new these guys have all shared yay Franc,1
teacher:Yes its easier to get the percents when you have a 100 as the denominator as the per per 100 so we are trying to go there and did you do like the quickest jump;student:Its easiest to get a percent when you have a 100 as the denominator,1
teacher:Yes to be 60 and 84;student:Well point sixeight if thats right,1
teacher:Rebecca,1
teacher:Is this simplest,1
teacher:Any other questions about the two cell phone companies,1
teacher:Oh up here,1
teacher:Up this one,1
teacher:Okay Eli,1
teacher:Sarah;student:Material,1
teacher:Carrie,1
teacher:How long what needs to be;student:How much of each thing they need how long maybe,1
teacher:Danielle,1
teacher:Sarah I see youve got a burning idea,1
teacher:Do you think we need to consider perimeter as well;student:What about perimeter,1
teacher:Jackson,1
teacher:Who is talking to you about volume;student:is talking to me about volume here,1
teacher:Eli;student:Timesing I used,1
teacher:Carrie,1
teacher:Maddy,1
teacher:Okay Sarah,1
teacher:I want to hear from Jared,1
teacher:Would you use a ruler to measure the volume of a gingerbread house,1
teacher:Materials and maybe quantity of materials how much;student:How many materials they need,1
teacher:All my tennis nobody  Whats that,1
teacher:Whats that,1
teacher:Charlotte ask your question,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Should I reread this right here,1
teacher:Who can restate that for me,1
teacher:Ian,1
teacher:Do you guys have the rest filled in,1
teacher:Does everyone see how I got 30 here,1
teacher:Have I used all my points,1
teacher:You dont know,1
teacher:The card and how much does the card have on it,1
teacher:Points right;student:Points,1
teacher:Awesome 100  N  6  P right,1
teacher:Griffin,1
teacher:Griffin,1
teacher:Who havent I heard from yet,1
teacher:A hundred;student:A hundred,1
teacher:As rides increase are we gaining more and more points left;student:It only goes straight up,1
teacher:Slim,1
teacher:What number goes into each box right;student:Well you can find out what number goes into each box,1
teacher:Hey ladies are you done,1
teacher:Is this group ready to move on,1
teacher:Take a moment to talk at your group;student:You could put it into a fraction,1
teacher:Is that what it says;student:Ms  can I go to the bathroom,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Is this fraction circle sliced up at all,1
teacher:Its what;student:Its a whole,1
teacher:Is this pizza sliced up at all,1
teacher:Madison;student:Its a half,1
teacher:James;student:Its a half,1
teacher:A whole right;student:Four,1
teacher:I might be huh;student:It probably is,1
teacher:Questions about why we labelled our numerator something or why we labelled our denominator something,1
teacher:Question yes;student:How do they come from being,1
teacher:We ate two slices which means we ate the whole pizza does that help,1
teacher:Lets look whats our next color;student:Yes,1
teacher:How many;student:Three,1
teacher:Can you split 17 into thirds;student:You cant split 17 into thirds,1
teacher:One my pizza is cut into three slices if I eat all of the slices I would eat three out of three I would eat the whole thing right;student:One,1
teacher:I hear you saying that because 17 is an odd number youre thinking youll have to use a fraction or a decimal;student:These two are probably going to be more easier,1
teacher:Ms Rossi Rachels feeling ready,1
teacher:Whos feeling really good about their tape diagram,1
teacher:Lindsay wait and see me after when you can solve it okay,1
teacher:Rachel,1
teacher:Maggie,1
teacher:What questions do you have about this problem before we move on,1
teacher:Any questions before we go to the next one,1
teacher:Ellis questions,1
teacher:Lindsay,1
teacher:Division;student:You could do a division,1
teacher:Multiplication;student:Multiplication,1
teacher:Angela do you think you could try to draw a tape diagram,1
teacher:Three;student:Three,1
teacher:Yes go ahead,1
teacher:Whos feeling that they might be ready to go up and draw their tape diagram on the board,1
teacher:Grant are you feeling ready,1
teacher:Go ahead and draw your tape diagram;student:Yes,1
teacher:Thats still quite a bit of pizza right;student:Its still a lot of pizza,1
teacher:No Austin;student:No,1
teacher:One two;student:One two,1
teacher:Are those the same,1
teacher:Equal in value;student:Yes,1
teacher:Cameron youre good,1
teacher:Should we try another one;student:Yes,1
teacher:Dark blue;student:Light green,1
teacher:Light green;student:Light green,1
teacher:Eight;student:Eight,1
teacher:Are you sure,1
teacher:Raise if you think dark blue has right slices;student:Yes,1
teacher:You think four eighths;student:Four eighths,1
teacher:Gabriella says if I take four of those slices theres four of them right;student:Yes,1
teacher:Is four eighths equivalent to one half,1
teacher:You want to try another one,1
teacher:Whats the next one we see,1
teacher:10;student:10,1
teacher:Maya,1
teacher:Diego says can we bust this up and make something equivalent to one half,1
teacher:One sixth right;student:One sixth,1
teacher:What Diego was asking is if we have something else thats cut even to even number of slices we should be able to make something equivalent to one half right,1
teacher:Do you think its one out of two,1
teacher:You think;student:Yes I think its one two,1
teacher:Adam;student:Because,1
teacher:What Adam is saying is if we compare it to one half to the Austin says is one half are those the same;student:Because one half is like one half of it and thats very narrow but if its two thirds and then its two thirds then that means if you take out one it cant be two thirds,1
teacher:Let me see thumbs on that feeling good,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:Should we bust it open,1
teacher:Paula say it nice and loud and proud,1
teacher:Sarah,1
teacher:Two fractions that represent the same amount right,1
teacher:Am I right,1
teacher:Do you agree,1
teacher:Question;student:Yes,1
teacher:If the piece is cut into an even number of slices we could find something equivalent to one half,1
teacher:Should we try it,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Do you remember yesterday when I gave you the word equivalent;student:Yes,1
teacher:Are you connecting the points as you go along;student:Larry Im stupid,1
teacher:Did someone at Miguels table hear what Paula said,1
teacher:Lindsay,1
teacher:Bigger;student:Bigger,1
teacher:a yacht,1
teacher:Do you think that doubling the points will change the shape of the boat,1
teacher:Maybe;student:Yes,1
teacher:Where is your new sailboat,1
teacher:Two times bigger;student:Two times bigger,1
teacher:Are you going to look at your sailboat number two,1
teacher:Because only one part of the coordinates is being multiplied its not going to maybe retain this in shape but look a little more different;student:Its going to look different because youre multiplying one part,1
teacher:Do you think it will get taller or wider in that boat in that new shape,1
teacher:and the yaxis stays the same youre predicting or making a conjecture that its going to be wider;student:Its wider,1
teacher:Do you want to work on new sailboat one or do you want to jump in where Liz and Louis are and work on a new sailboat,1
teacher:More sense;student:Because it makes more sense,1
teacher:Can zero be doubled,1
teacher:Really big;student:Its looking the exact same but just really big,1
teacher:Times two;student:Wait times two bigger,1
teacher:Finished;student:Im finished,1
teacher:Two times wider;student:Two times wider,1
teacher:How are you girls here,1
teacher:You know what;student:Wait do I leave this one zero,1
teacher:Mostly;student:No,1
teacher:Do you need help in building your sailboat;student:Im not smart,1
teacher:Seven,1
teacher:The same but bigger;student:I think that its going to be the same but bigger,1
teacher:Multiply it by two;student:Multiply it by two,1
teacher:Do you see an X on the graph,1
teacher:Louis are you working on doubling your points,1
teacher:how are you,1
teacher:Do you need,1
teacher:Is this your sailboat,1
teacher:Did you follow the points on the chart,1
teacher:Did you check your points;student:This straight edge is really helping,1
teacher:51,1
teacher:Did you talk to Liz about what happens when youre multiplying by zero,1
teacher:You dont remember,1
teacher:It will be way bigger;student:I think itll be way bigger,1
teacher:xaxis;student:Because we multiplied the first number by two and thats the xaxis,1
teacher:Okay did anything change on the yaxis,1
teacher:Are you looking Is the coordinate that you want to plot 02,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:You found when you were just working with numbers,1
teacher:Gabby actually can I hold up your board,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Paula,1
teacher:Rachel,1
teacher:You know what,1
teacher:See how it kind of looks like a piece of tape,1
teacher:Did we solve the problem,1
teacher:You guys feeling ready to try another tape diagram problem,1
teacher:What questions do you have before we move to the next problem,1
teacher:Any questions at Jeremiahs table,1
teacher:Eileen whats your question,1
teacher:All right read this next problem,1
teacher:Someone else read the problem for us,1
teacher:Not really;student:Not really,1
teacher:Did you find that using addition helped you solve the problem,1
teacher:Then I see youve got four columns and six rows;student:Yes,1
teacher:Did you boxes look It looks like it It kind of looks like a grid like this,1
teacher:Then on the yaxis,1
teacher:Yes you did all aspects of it doubled by two;student:I am not smart,1
teacher:Did you try that one,1
teacher:Ellis;student:Lets go,1
teacher:Paula,1
teacher:Someone at Maggies table,1
teacher:Miguel,1
teacher:I want to hear from someone at Paulas table,1
teacher:You want me to come back to you,1
teacher:Maybe they werent thinking about it at the time;student:They just werent thinking about it at the time,1
teacher:Eileen,1
teacher:Now do I have enough to subtract,1
teacher:Did we talk about reducing or simplifying in 4th grade,1
teacher:Grant what about you,1
teacher:Before we move on any final questions about addition and subtraction of fractions,1
teacher:You dont know;student:I dont know,1
teacher:Just stretching,1
teacher:So I have to multiply them all by six;student:Because whatever you do the bottom you must do to the top,1
teacher:Angel,1
teacher:All right lets share all that weve got,1
teacher:Huh;student:Student growth,1
teacher:I like it but we need to be a little bit more specific because is it the whole school,1
teacher:Is it the whole world,1
teacher:Is it the whole country,1
teacher:Landon,1
teacher:Alyssa,1
teacher:What;student:Mrs Robertss class growth,1
teacher:Alyssa you were saying,1
teacher:Does that give us a pretty good title for what were about to do,1
teacher:See,1
teacher:Joy,1
teacher:Do we care about those 10 years,1
teacher:Talk about where youre going to start and talk about what youre going to do,1
teacher:Have we established what our first number on our line plot is going to be,1
teacher:at one right;student:So whats the last,1
teacher:Raise your hand;student:Students,1
teacher:three is three more than three and a half,1
teacher:Huh,1
teacher:Eliza,1
teacher:So if I made this title would that be a good title for my line plot,1
teacher:Kim,1
teacher:How about pets per student,1
teacher:It does zero counts because is it possible to not have any pets,1
teacher:Henry,1
teacher:Huh,1
teacher:How are you doing,1
teacher:Yes we do but will Mrs McCain if I bring her this data;student:No,1
teacher:Does it matter;student:No,1
teacher:If I took this line plot over the way it is right here I drew this on a piece of paper and I took it to Mrs McCain would she understand it,1
teacher:She doesnt huh;student:But it doesnt matter,1
teacher:Bailey says she doesnt know how many have certain number of pets but does she,1
teacher:First off does she know how many people are at Table 1,1
teacher:Using that data does she know how many people are at Table 1;student:Yes,1
teacher:So this takes this information this data which is pretty much useless the way it is right,1
teacher:Now in this particular line plot does he have any data points that occur zero times,1
teacher:Talk,1
teacher:Jonah do you have a clue or youre just still drawing and coloring,1
teacher:Joshua nothing;student:No,1
teacher:Remember when we did partial products we got a whole bunch of products that the answers to multiplication problems and then we have to add them all up to put them together,1
teacher:Talk as a table,1
teacher:Michael,1
teacher:Cameron,1
teacher:Place values right;student:Your horns  the value,1
teacher:Complex multidigit numbers,1
teacher:So if I have the problem 56 times 78 how many of you can do that in your head,1
teacher:But how many of you can do that one in your head,1
teacher:Zeros;student:35,1
teacher:See,1
teacher:Daniela,1
teacher:Lacy,1
teacher:Lynn,1
teacher:So do you see how it depends on what the question says,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:Lacy,1
teacher:The one student right;student:What would we do next,1
teacher:Huh;student:Ill go ask,1
teacher:but start talking,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:Correct,1
teacher:Does it matter with the side of this,1
teacher:Melissa,1
teacher:Class,1
teacher:A half an inch right;student:They grew,1
teacher:So if I walk next door and I gave those numbers like that to Mrs McCain would she understand what it means,1
teacher:Is that the smallest number in our data set,1
teacher:Three and what;student:Three and one half,1
teacher:Is that our largest growth,1
teacher:What Mr Parker,1
teacher:Melissa,1
teacher:Seven;student:Seven,1
teacher:Your lowest should be one half your highest should be three and a half that means you have to fill three in but are there going to be any Xs,1
teacher:Alyssa,1
teacher:One and one half;student:One and one half,1
teacher:Does that make sense to everybody,1
teacher:You ready,1
teacher:Huh,1
teacher:Miss Sara please teach your fellow classmates what you were just telling me,1
teacher:This is thirds and this is halves right,1
teacher:If I take two thirds can I make a half,1
teacher:And if I have a half does it equal a third,1
teacher:Are all of those shapes the same,1
teacher:Talk as your table,1
teacher:Charles,1
teacher:I always ask you to show your work right,1
teacher:Wow are we asleep;student:Yes,1
teacher:I always ask you to show your work right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Juliana did you have a question,1
teacher:Does it do you any good to finish them all and then you go help Camden,1
teacher:You hear now Mr Sean,1
teacher:Everybody hearing that,1
teacher:Is threethird equal to one;student:Yes,1
teacher:In this problem;student:A denominator,1
teacher:Is threethirds equal to one;student:Yes,1
teacher:Youre really going to listen to him,1
teacher:You have the answer,1
teacher:Do you have the answer,1
teacher:Talk to your team,1
teacher:Did you get bigger value,1
teacher:Did you fix,1
teacher:Talk as a team,1
teacher:Are you confident;student:No,1
teacher:Does that look familiar;student:and then you get your answer threesixths,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Talk as a table,1
teacher:Sixsixth is equal to one right,1
teacher:Well two halves is equal to one right,1
teacher:Threethirds is equal to one right,1
teacher:Chance you can answer this question;student:You can not do two halves,1
teacher:Is two halves equal to one,1
teacher:Is two halves equal to one,1
teacher:Repeat what you said,1
teacher:What one;student:The five tells us how many pieces we need to make one,1
teacher:Amy,1
teacher:Thats what I would do;student:Count how much wholes you have,1
teacher:Angela,1
teacher:Do you need your Mr Parker to repeat the question;student:Antonio,1
teacher:Repeat your question loudly;student:Repeat your question,1
teacher:Does that help them understand why we do that,1
teacher:Antonio,1
teacher:Michelle,1
teacher:Is three less than five;student:Three,1
teacher:Every time we take away one group of five marbles that equals one sack right,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:Question,1
teacher:A decimal,1
teacher:You guys listening,1
teacher:Got it,1
teacher:So line segments arent straight,1
teacher:Mr Gale,1
teacher:Do you have to;student:Yes,1
teacher:Now can you put numbers inside,1
teacher:Good,1
teacher:How quickly you forget the lessons from just yesterday,1
teacher:Joanna,1
teacher:Can we use marbles and bags;student:How many candy bars fit in the bag,1
teacher:Remi,1
teacher:Juliana,1
teacher:Now ironically when we create a mixed number will they all necessarily be full bags,1
teacher:Emerson,1
teacher:Joy,1
teacher:You said I have to draw 38 circles,1
teacher:Call on somebody else,1
teacher:You do 5 or 10;student:I think its 5 or 10,1
teacher:How many poodles;student:How much can fit into the bag,1
teacher:Donkeys minivans spaceships;student:How many,1
teacher:Keep going;student:Marbles,1
teacher:Is that kind of important in this question,1
teacher:Andre;student:Jacob what do you do now,1
teacher:What you do is convert the improper fraction,1
teacher:Right whatever well figure it out right;student:Its like each bar is 1620 which should point whatever,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Oh really none of you,1
teacher:Am I done,1
teacher:Ms Emily what is our question;student:Five,1
teacher:Is what;student:Is the fraction,1
teacher:Okay questions about that,1
teacher:How many of you did something other than 200 to start,1
teacher:Are you not grasping this concept,1
teacher:Any other questions,1
teacher:Are we done,1
teacher:Is the prime factorization for 45 just 3 x 3 Missy,1
teacher:Stella,1
teacher:Four times;student:Then the 8 there is 4 x 4,1
teacher:Are we done,1
teacher:Finley,1
teacher:Stella did you do that,1
teacher:Did you get to the least common multiple,1
teacher:5x13;student:13,1
teacher:Lisa,1
teacher:Brielle am I done,1
teacher:Now are you all going to have the same number over here,1
teacher:Is this the right answer,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Yes maam;student:Wait I have a question,1
teacher:Always put it off to the side of your problem so we know where were going okay,1
teacher:All alright Mr Jack,1
teacher:She asks in the thinking box do we always multiply by the divisor,1
teacher:The answer is yes always because the divisor tells us either how many groups were going to have or how many per group we have right,1
teacher:Did everybody hear that,1
teacher:Jack what did I just say;student:Yes,1
teacher:Gavin what did I just say,1
teacher:Roman what did I just say;student:Use,1
teacher:Roman what did I just say,1
teacher:Jack what did I just say,1
teacher:Gavin what did I just say,1
teacher:What did I say Roman,1
teacher:Arianna,1
teacher:Is that what you got Hudson 360,1
teacher:Is that what you said,1
teacher:Any questions about that,1
teacher:You have it still right,1
teacher:With that,1
teacher:Are you done with that,1
teacher:How did it go Jacob,1
teacher:Were going to all get together prior to  Okay,1
teacher:Royce youre working on that,1
teacher:This is it,1
teacher:All right so its the same right,1
teacher:What are you working on Hudson,1
teacher:Yes;student:Ms,1
teacher:Iits just fractions but Im trying to have them in between  You know what I mean,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:You what;student:Can I,1
teacher:Everyone over here what did I just say,1
teacher:Did you read up here,1
teacher:Could we use this right here to get to 15,1
teacher:Are you here too Hudson,1
teacher:There you go okay,1
teacher:Maybe draw the lines remember when we talked about,1
teacher:Its an activity of Whats that,1
teacher:Hudson are you done,1
teacher:You dont want to do the next one;student:Im done,1
teacher:Laura youre done right,1
teacher:You want to try one;student:I think I can finish it,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:240   10 right,1
teacher:What Im going to teach you later on If you didnt hear what Brians question is Brian had a good question do we always have to write the remainder as a fraction,1
teacher:Did you do that here;student:Divide by ten,1
teacher:Sandra did you finish your quiz,1
teacher:Sandra,1
teacher:Sandra;student:Yes,1
teacher:Oh did you,1
teacher:We could do that;student:From here it looks like its 34,1
teacher:Yes so try that instead I think then youre going to have more success okay;student:Oh yes,1
teacher:Like four or five of these up here,1
teacher:Is it,1
teacher:How many of you guys want my help,1
teacher:Do you see how once we got to 15 we did it two different ways,1
teacher:Yes Katie,1
teacher:Can I use that to solve the problem;student:Yes,1
teacher:But is it my best choice,1
teacher:Youre following Vanessa,1
teacher:Youre following Zach;student:Yes,1
teacher:Really;student:Yes,1
teacher:Now how can I check this,1
teacher:Do I have a six,1
teacher:Do I have a 10;student:Yes,1
teacher:Do I have a 60;student:Yes,1
teacher:Jason,1
teacher:Talk as a table,1
teacher:How many chicken nuggets we have,1
teacher:Is my bucket empty,1
teacher:Isnt that what I was trying to do,1
teacher:Isnt the goal of division to try to divide everything youve got out evenly,1
teacher:How many of you know how to multiply by 10,1
teacher:Who can tell me,1
teacher:Arianna,1
teacher:Table five;student:6 times 20,1
teacher:Does Cameron know know exactly what we should use,1
teacher:Did we just make up numbers and put them on the paper,1
teacher:Does the question change,1
teacher:The question is what it is right;student:No,1
teacher:Youre 100 right and you actually used good math terms but can you use it in our marble problem;student:Because its larger than the dividend and if you try and subtract it from your divided then its going to be a negative,1
teacher:Did you all hear what  said,1
teacher:Jack did you hear what she said,1
teacher:Lacy please restate what Ms  said so that Jack and Zach can hear it and pay attention this time,1
teacher:We cant use something we dont have guys okay,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Go go go,1
teacher:Table two,1
teacher:Table three;student:We did six times 20,1
teacher:Table four;student:6 times 10,1
teacher:Table four;student:Six times,1
teacher:Would it work,1
teacher:Ms,1
teacher:Marcus,1
teacher:Cameron,1
teacher:Do I have 18 marbles,1
teacher:Arianna,1
teacher:Are we done,1
teacher:Because three marbles left can we fill up another bag of six;student:We knew were done because,1
teacher:Were going to do 6 times 10 because we know 60 works right,1
teacher:Can we do that one,1
teacher:Thats too big right;student:That you cant do it because its bigger than,1
teacher:Could we do this one,1
teacher:Could we do six times one,1
teacher:Can we do it again;student:Six,1
teacher:Are we done;student:Yes,1
teacher:Any questions about either one of those,1
teacher:Yes Emily,1
teacher:Are you trying to put them in bags with six marbles in each one,1
teacher:Lynn,1
teacher:Jonah,1
teacher:Good because 15 is larger than 6 right;student:Because we can still have more in the bag,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Are we done,1
teacher:Jason;student:Were trying to figure out what our portions is,1
teacher:If the question is asking how many full bags of marbles we will have do we care about the three that are leftover,1
teacher:Following that Mr Zach,1
teacher:Mr Jack are you following that,1
teacher:Did you when I first taught it to you,1
teacher:Daniela,1
teacher:You what,1
teacher:Down here;student:When we are doing the more easier because if we dont want to  when You know how you did 15 and we did,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Do we need to write anything else on the thinking box,1
teacher:No we can do this one again can we;student:No,1
teacher:60 is less than 75 right Jack;student:Yes,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Lynn,1
teacher:You mean 60 from 75;student:We have to subtract 75 from 60,1
teacher:How many are left in the bucket;student:How many,1
teacher:We go back to our;student:We can,1
teacher:Did you do like place value,1
teacher:What other questions do you have,1
teacher:Brielle,1
teacher:Say it,1
teacher:Can we use the pattern and use what we know,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Say it extrapolate,1
teacher:You know what,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Do you have four five and six done,1
teacher:Jaxon,1
teacher:Do we agree;student:I do not think that the first expression is greater than 45 x 9 because in the parenthesis it has 45 x 9 and then it has  50 so I know its going to be less than 45 x 9,1
teacher:Bowie,1
teacher:Allen,1
teacher:Is the value of the expression less than 798  212,1
teacher:Talk to your kneetoknee partner,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Agree;student:I got yes because of youre going to be subtracting so I could just tell by that that it would be less than 198  212,1
teacher:Are you ready to think,1
teacher:Is anybody else willing to let us see their journal how they wrote down the rule or the pattern,1
teacher:Are you guys talking,1
teacher:Your job right now is to explain to each other do Ingrids ordered pairs model the data,1
teacher:Ready;student:No,1
teacher:Talk to the partner go,1
teacher:Were really good at getting our ordered pairs on the graph but is it important what order you put them in,1
teacher:You see why,1
teacher:Have you learned this;student:Yaxis,1
teacher:My friends do you have this data in your graph on your page right now,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Are they in this same order,1
teacher:Does it look like this,1
teacher:Is there a rule or a pattern in this graph,1
teacher:Did you talk about a rule or a pattern on number two or three,1
teacher:Did you find the pattern,1
teacher:Are you always the same number of years apart,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Amanda,1
teacher:One two three,1
teacher:Andrea;student:Coordinates,1
teacher:Jaxon,1
teacher:Jace,1
teacher:Show me on your fingers how many minutes you think you need to finish this up,1
teacher:Oh do you want to try,1
teacher:Bianca,1
teacher:Declan,1
teacher:Jaxon,1
teacher:Who would like to come share theirs as well,1
teacher:Wesley,1
teacher:Who can talk to me about doubling the zero before we start,1
teacher:Allen,1
teacher:Fill out number two while you and your partner talk,1
teacher:Was that at 104,1
teacher:Briar,1
teacher:Jaxon;student:The zero point,1
teacher:Amanda;student:Origin,1
teacher:Adelle,1
teacher:Jaxon,1
teacher:Raise your hand,1
teacher:Raise your hands,1
teacher:Adelle,1
teacher:Did you know before you even finished your sailboat if it was going to be larger or smaller,1
teacher:Adrianna,1
teacher:Andrea,1
teacher:Coordinates;student:Coordinates,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:One two three,1
teacher:Who would like to read that first little paragraph up there,1
teacher:Bethany,1
teacher:Will that work,1
teacher:Doubling the first coordinate will that work,1
teacher:xavier,1
teacher:If one were bigger than the other and  by how much,1
teacher:Jose,1
teacher:xavier,1
teacher:Jaxon a comment,1
teacher:Does anyone want to switch sides,1
teacher:Do Ingrids ordered pairs model the data,1
teacher:Okay are you guys with me,1
teacher:All right so if we multiply this out 126 times 275 is 34650 okay;student:Yes,1
teacher:Now Im going to take that 34650 with the decimals here right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:I would like everybody just to do the odd numbers okay,1
teacher:Do you want me to do the first one with you,1
teacher:To 10;student:To 10,1
teacher:Were trying to make our lives easier right,1
teacher:So were going to multiply 761 times 96 okay,1
teacher:Annie,1
teacher:Does that make the number close to this,1
teacher:I dont think thats easy to multiply,1
teacher:Its really close to 200 isnt it,1
teacher:Five,1
teacher:Okay if were making the answer close to 400 then the decimal would have to go here right,1
teacher:Wayne are you with me,1
teacher:Okay howd it go,1
teacher:Then Im going to multiply 275 times 10 squared because there are two place values right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:What are you doing,1
teacher:You did that in your head or did you use a calculator,1
teacher:Got it,1
teacher:Will you show your answer quickly;student:Yes,1
teacher:Tera,1
teacher:Does that makes sense;student:My first step was to estimate so I rounded 68 up to seven and then I rounded 21 down to two and I knew seven times two is 14 and then it said to ignore the decimals so I made 68 into 68 and then I made 21 into 21 so it needs to be  as in 428 and then in order to place the decimal I put my estimate and then it was 14 so I knew that was a tenths place so I put the decimal after tenth place,1
teacher:Is an estimate going to help you with that,1
teacher:Wayne are you with us,1
teacher:Is an estimate going to help us with that;student:Yes,1
teacher:Talk to your shoulder partner,1
teacher:Okay so what do you guys think about that,1
teacher:Shelia does that help us,1
teacher:Would it help you to make an estimate with that,1
teacher:So to make this into 73 I need to multiply are you guys paying attention,1
teacher:This is a new thing we are moving the decimal place three times so were multiplying this times 10 to the third and then here we need to multiply it by two so were going to move that two places so altogether we have 10 to the fifth right,1
teacher:126 times I need shift that over so theres no decimal in there so its 10 to the first power right,1
teacher:I might say Okay were going to do page What were we on 140,1
teacher:Sound good,1
teacher:Get it,1
teacher:Whats it asking while Collins Corey,1
teacher:Yes Elise,1
teacher:You want to tell us;student:I agree with your answer but I did it differently on how to figure it out,1
teacher:Sometimes it helps to see the very first one doesnt it,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:What do we think about that,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:My friends youre getting so good at plotting coordinate points right,1
teacher:Does anyone want to read that top sentence for us,1
teacher:Casey read it for us,1
teacher:Do Ingrids ordered pairs model the data,1
teacher:Does this model match this,1
teacher:Does her table match her data,1
teacher:Does the data that she wrote represent,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Stay standing if youre at team five,1
teacher:Everybody show me on your fingers what number are you working on,1
teacher:Talk,1
teacher:Ready go,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Twos and fours youre talking now,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Elise,1
teacher:Do you know your team numbers,1
teacher:Stand up if youre a two,1
teacher:Stay standing if you are a team four,1
teacher:Would you mind showing that under the document camera;student:We got four and a half because we drew like  we all drew a rectangle and then we split it into two and we were able to split them all so they had four,1
teacher:Is it one half of nine,1
teacher:Is that what the problem is,1
teacher:Everyone seeing how she did that,1
teacher:Friends stand up if you are number four at your team,1
teacher:If you are a number two stand up,1
teacher:Yes then youre going to place the decimalbased on your estimate okay;student:You place the decimal point,1
teacher:Should we go back,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Owen,1
teacher:River,1
teacher:Class city class,1
teacher:I have 52 ones,1
teacher:Look at this example solve it with your table go,1
teacher:Pam ta da pam pam,1
teacher:Samual,1
teacher:Correct,1
teacher:Who would like to be my next Ms Koski,1
teacher:Aria,1
teacher:Mathew,1
teacher:So Mathew keep going,1
teacher:Penelope,1
teacher:Is that what you are saying,1
teacher:Pam param pam pam,1
teacher:Have you ever heard of a vertical,1
teacher:Layla,1
teacher:River,1
teacher:Okay now am I done;student:Done,1
teacher:Im I done,1
teacher:Levi;student:No,1
teacher:Lucy,1
teacher:Classidy class,1
teacher:Give me place to five how are you feeling about addition right now,1
teacher:60;student:Number 60,1
teacher:She is like Okay six is in the tenth place right,1
teacher:Antony,1
teacher:Everyone say hundredths,1
teacher:We have 68 correct,1
teacher:28,1
teacher:Asher,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Caleb,1
teacher:Give me a thumbs up when you are done with seven tenths,1
teacher:Answers,1
teacher:Do these match,1
teacher:Classidy class,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Do you start in the hundredths place,1
teacher:Oliver,1
teacher:Who has the problem written down on their board,1
teacher:Abigail read me off the problem please,1
teacher:Emily,1
teacher:Would I write it like this,1
teacher:Do you notice how Im aligning the decimals;student:Because its in the tenths place and eleven would put you in the ones place,1
teacher:Do we match;student:One,1
teacher:to five how are you feeling;student:I agree,1
teacher:Lucas,1
teacher:Did you hear Lucas;student:To do something correctly and as quickly as possible,1
teacher:Henry,1
teacher:Who can read the word adapted to the class,1
teacher:Charlie,1
teacher:Everyone say the word align,1
teacher:We will know we are successful when we can explain whos talking,1
teacher:One two three,1
teacher:Lucas,1
teacher:Elijah,1
teacher:Olivia,1
teacher:Can we put it in multiple places,1
teacher:Evelyn,1
teacher:Class,1
teacher:Knee to knee,1
teacher:William stand up,1
teacher:William,1
teacher:Lucy,1
teacher:Again can you repeat the word form of this number;student:I agree with Elijah,1
teacher:Were going to say William you just blew my mind,1
teacher:I never said pause and socialize did I,1
teacher:Who do I see doing a great job,1
teacher:Lucas will you please stand up,1
teacher:Do you see who cant see,1
teacher:Okay were going to go to Lucas were going to do  Oh oh oh oh you did a good job you did a good job,1
teacher:One two three,1
teacher:Lets have Charlotte,1
teacher:Bianca,1
teacher:Im I done,1
teacher:Im I done with 33 hundredths,1
teacher:Andrea;student:X coordinate and Y coordinate,1
teacher:Andrea,1
teacher:One two three,1
teacher:How will we be successful today,1
teacher:If I was looking at Valentinas work I would want to make sure that since Im looking at this for the first time that it makes sense to me because her rule should make sense to just someone random looking at it right,1
teacher:Who can read,1
teacher:Colton can you read the blue,1
teacher:Pink Ruby;student:How many answers do you need,1
teacher:Ari;student:Using the appropriate process to solve the problem accurately,1
teacher:Who can read A,1
teacher:Aaron,1
teacher:Alice,1
teacher:Charlie C;student:This means,1
teacher:D Auden;student:This suggests,1
teacher:Then Nolan can you read D,1
teacher:Jaxon;student:Xaxis,1
teacher:F Cameron T;student:Yes,1
teacher:Briar,1
teacher:Bianca,1
teacher:Does the trapezoid look the way you expected,1
teacher:First lets turn and talk to your shoulder partner,1
teacher:Does it look the way you expected,1
teacher:Is the trapezoid what you expected,1
teacher:Bianca,1
teacher:You were surprised just to see the Y coordinates not change;student:That we missed something it became larger on the Xaxis,1
teacher:Allen,1
teacher:Which one are you missing,1
teacher:Classy classy,1
teacher:Friends,1
teacher:Classidy class,1
teacher:Remember the one thing that we tend to miss is explaining our mathematical reasoning okay,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Amanda,1
teacher:Andrea;student:Yaxis,1
teacher:Okay and Valentina H;student:This mathematical thinking explains why,1
teacher:Low voices working hard go,1
teacher:For what;student:Can you make a handshake for that,1
teacher:Turn knee to knee and talk,1
teacher:Asher,1
teacher:Asher,1
teacher:Lucy,1
teacher:Raise your hand,1
teacher:Violet,1
teacher:Levi,1
teacher:Who is ready,1
teacher:Who is showing me active listening,1
teacher:Arden,1
teacher:River,1
teacher:Talk to your team about how you are going to fill out that grid,1
teacher:Matteo,1
teacher:Claire,1
teacher:Im I done;student:You feel three tenths one two three,1
teacher:Ezra,1
teacher:To show something;student:Im not sure but to show something or maybe,1
teacher:Arden,1
teacher:Wyatt,1
teacher:For show;student:For showing,1
teacher:Switch those two numbers okay,1
teacher:River,1
teacher:Willow are you and your partner telling a story,1
teacher:Classy class,1
teacher:Lily,1
teacher:I want you to do Levi do we do that,1
teacher:Five rows;student:Five rows,1
teacher:Did you see how I messed up saying that,1
teacher:Levi lets start with you;student:Im still doing mine,1
teacher:Matteo,1
teacher:Matteo,1
teacher:Violet,1
teacher:One two three,1
teacher:Turn and talk to your knee to knee partner,1
teacher:I will know Im successful when I can accurately,1
teacher:Show me a thumbs up when you are done,1
teacher:Say the word alignment;student:Align,1
teacher:Are we clear,1
teacher:Enrique,1
teacher:The answers yes,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Finn will you read that number for me,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Now does it make sense,1
teacher:Nessa you want to read it,1
teacher:We have talked about algorithms many times before right;student:Stepbystep in prepping for doing something such as learning the computation in solving this problem,1
teacher:Any questions about our learning session,1
teacher:Ellie will you read that for us please,1
teacher:One two three four five six,1
teacher:Did you guys understand that,1
teacher:You want me to shade it for you,1
teacher:My shade mark is on that way and you were supposed to label these right,1
teacher:Hello,1
teacher:Are you with me Tera,1
teacher:Got it,1
teacher:Zoey will you read that number for me,1
teacher:What;student:I still dont know how it works,1
teacher:Are there any questions about that,1
teacher:Paul,1
teacher:Perimeter is something totally different than what were talking about but youre talking about the length of the edges right;student:I just want So wouldnt that be four ninths becauseBruce said Im pretty sure thats how many of the squares there are but its not how much the perimeter is,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Talk to your neighbors ab or talk to your shoulder partner,1
teacher:Sarah,1
teacher:Did you work withTera,1
teacher:Was there any questions;student:You can just do the rest of the lesson if you  if you want,1
teacher:Is that what youre asking,1
teacher:Alexa;student:Three,1
teacher:First of all who can read this number,1
teacher:Somebody read this number for me,1
teacher:Missy,1
teacher:Kayla,1
teacher:Clay,1
teacher:Tricky huh,1
teacher:Do you want to show your work;student:I shaded,1
teacher:33;student:I shaded in the whole box right here and then I did 33 and I took out that,1
teacher:Any questions for Mariah;student:Then I became easy and I shaded it all and then I double shaded this part,1
teacher:Okay so heres the question if we have four fifths times two thirds is the answer going to be more than each of these factors right,1
teacher:These other factors or is it going to be less than those factors,1
teacher:RIcardo,1
teacher:Does that make sense Sarah,1
teacher:Okay so here we started out Audrey with two thirds right,1
teacher:If its a fraction times a fraction if both factors are fractions its going to be smaller right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Hey Todd will you read our learning intentions for today,1
teacher:Didnt you guys ever play that game with your mom,1
teacher:because Then as we can see here Do you guys remember this rule;student:Because,1
teacher:Paige will you read the,1
teacher:success criteria please;student:Success,1
teacher:Does that make sense;student:If its clear theres no more mistaking it Miss Esther,1
teacher:Is that an ocean thats west of us,1
teacher:T,1
teacher:Talk to your partners,1
teacher:That would be the perfect explanation for how you would explain multiplying fractions using an area model right Finn,1
teacher:Talk to your table,1
teacher:Sarah,1
teacher:Nessa do you have a question for her;student:I dont think so,1
teacher:Does your picture Are there any other questions;student:I did 34  23  612 because 3  2  6 and 4  3  12,1
teacher:The part that wasnt clear that was hard was that Do you see what were saying,1
teacher:Roberto,1
teacher:What I end up with is this area is double shaded right,1
teacher:Correct,1
teacher:This is the same as 3  2 over 4  3 to get 612 right,1
teacher:Do you have a question;student:Two thirds,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Youre already done,1
teacher:In the opposite direction so then youd have thirds in one direction and fifths in the other right Marco;student:You would add on this drawing,1
teacher:Then you put that in,1
teacher:Thirds this way and Id label it;student:Yes,1
teacher:What did you say fifths the other direction,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:The denominator;student:Then from  the numerator times the numerator,1
teacher:Thats the same what;student:Thats the same,1
teacher:To be specific you might give an example right;student:Why cant you be on,1
teacher:Talk to your table group,1
teacher:The area;student:It says over here,1
teacher:Is it math,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Are you guys done,1
teacher:Give me a thumbs up if youre done,1
teacher:Did you talk to your friend about what you noticed,1
teacher:Onefifth is two right,1
teacher:Did you get that,1
teacher:If onefifth of 10 is two then threefifths of 10 would be two times three because you want three of the onefifths right,1
teacher:Or onefifth plus onefifth plus onefifth equals threefifth right,1
teacher:Everybody say unit fraction,1
teacher:Lets read it together,1
teacher:Mariah,1
teacher:If onetenth is one then three of those is one two three right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Hudson do you have a question Im sorry,1
teacher:Is it the same,1
teacher:Theyre all multiples of three;student:I think  those were all multiples but,1
teacher:Are you guys ready,1
teacher:Are you with me,1
teacher:Is that what it looked like,1
teacher:Did anybody do counting up,1
teacher:What are you doing,1
teacher:Did you do it,1
teacher:Did you do it,1
teacher:Go Nessa,1
teacher:What;student:This is,1
teacher:Oh Francdid it,1
teacher:Neither,1
teacher:This one;student:This one,1
teacher:Okay so we start at the number that were subtracting right,1
teacher:1220 then right,1
teacher:Cash registers that are calculators;student:When you dont have to  and now that we have those,1
teacher:To find your balance you would subtract what you spend right Nessa,1
teacher:Lisa would you like to read that,1
teacher:Hudson whats our success criteria,1
teacher:I want you to write down an expression to model the problem that Im asking you okay,1
teacher:All right are you ready,1
teacher:Can I get a volunteer,1
teacher:To what;student:Show your work,1
teacher:Show your work to;student:Show your work,1
teacher:The area model lets read this together,1
teacher:Evan,1
teacher:Jason,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Two,1
teacher:Are you guys done,1
teacher:Stand up when youre done,1
teacher:Four eighths;student:Four eighths,1
teacher:Alexander will you please read question one,1
teacher:Youre thinking about it;student:Im still thinking about it,1
teacher:With the coordinate grid;student:It was with the coordinates grid,1
teacher:Talk to your table,1
teacher:Because;student:Because it says over there,1
teacher:To what;student:Show your work,1
teacher:Success criteria Mariah will you read it,1
teacher:The area of the base is what you started with when we were working with volume;student:Its extremely heavy,1
teacher:Penny;student:Finding out the area of something,1
teacher:Missy,1
teacher:Zoey,1
teacher:Talk to your neighbor,1
teacher:Zoey,1
teacher:Do you have one,1
teacher:Is that what weve been practicing,1
teacher:Have we ever done a problem like that,1
teacher:Tyler,1
teacher:Did you hear,1
teacher:You guys have a little conversation check each other and make sure youre all on the same page,1
teacher:Stella,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Onefourth of eight is six,1
teacher:Threefourths is less than one right,1
teacher:Got it,1
teacher:Threefourths of sixteen is four,1
teacher:Did you hear your friends,1
teacher:Frst youre going to estimate the real thing okay,1
teacher:Did anybody get a clearer idea of what concise means,1
teacher:What was your first clue just that Im not very concise  wasnt it,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:That makes sense to you guys,1
teacher:So this is actually a third of a half right,1
teacher:So really its the same as taking a third of a half because were starting with a half which is the same as multiplication right,1
teacher:Go and be ready to share your answer your explanation with your table group,1
teacher:Are you done,1
teacher:Heres a third but then I need to divide that into two parts right,1
teacher:This makes sense to you all,1
teacher:Okay partner A you go first,1
teacher:Zoey were you partner A or B,1
teacher:Will you stand up please,1
teacher:Okay this time its partner B ready go,1
teacher:Tera and Kayla youre not done,1
teacher:Alve are you partner A or partner B,1
teacher:Okay so the answer is nine;student:I thought that it would be nine,1
teacher:Six;student:Six,1
teacher:Its going to move;student:Its going to move,1
teacher:Talk to your table group,1
teacher:Talk to your neighbor,1
teacher:Your table,1
teacher:Are we multiplying 14 x 45,1
teacher:Times eight;student:Well its,1
teacher:None of it,1
teacher:Everybody say Representation,1
teacher:Its hard isnt it,1
teacher:Its not always so easy is it,1
teacher:You guys are going to work with Do you want to work in table groups or do you want to work with partners,1
teacher:Any other Ms Gibsons,1
teacher:Did you do a representation or a picture for that,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:Did anybody do a picture,1
teacher:So you used mental map to figure that one out,1
teacher:Any pictures,1
teacher:No representations you all did it in your head,1
teacher:Anything else,1
teacher:Are you partnering,1
teacher:All right Stella oh you guys are you done,1
teacher:Wayne are you partnering,1
teacher:This one,1
teacher:Can we give him two claps for that,1
teacher:Can we give him two claps for that,1
teacher:Talk to your shoulder partner,1
teacher:Eight plus one;student:I would have done eight plus one,1
teacher:Eight plus one,1
teacher:EIleen,1
teacher:Were you not listening to EIleen,1
teacher:EIleen will you please tell her again,1
teacher:Portia,1
teacher:Matty,1
teacher:Can you guys listen up,1
teacher:Okay because theseSShave different place values right;student:In the questions they do too but the decimal is always in a different place value,1
teacher:Is there a decimal on this one;student:In 12 times eight theres a decimal in that one and its not in the eight and the twelve,1
teacher:Decimals go here right,1
teacher:Clay,1
teacher:Can we give him two claps for that,1
teacher:You guys understand that,1
teacher:Can we give him two claps for this,1
teacher:The decimal place will move,1
teacher:so can you read what that number will be,1
teacher:Bruce are you partner A or partner B,1
teacher:Today this is our learning intention can I get people whose numbers have a factor of two,1
teacher:Those of you who are standing will you please read the learning intention,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Oh what did you say Joyce;student:How much money he spends,1
teacher:Shelia,1
teacher:Here they rounded it or they just got rid of the whole number or the decimals out of the whole numbers and then rounded the decimals and added those to the whole numbers to get a sum thats an estimation okay,1
teacher:An estimation is just usually fifth graders when they make an estimate they are trying to help themselves be sure that their answers are correct when they do the actual calculation does that make sense,1
teacher:Is that why you do it Clay,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Youre going to need to be able to solve and explain the strategy today okay,1
teacher:Are you thinking,1
teacher:Are you going to solve that,1
teacher:Usually is you are simplifying the problem and making it more efficient right;student:Its you round the factors and the numbers problem to try to find around what your answer will be like close to an answer it will be,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Oh 8 x 23 is going to tell you how much money he has left;student:How much money does he have left,1
teacher:Say it again;student:How much money does he have for food,1
teacher:Are there more,1
teacher:Everybody say it,1
teacher:Okay everybodys done,1
teacher:Sarah,1
teacher:Stella,1
teacher:Asher,1
teacher:Royce;student:93 93,1
teacher:When were doing that basically we are saying if we need to add fractions or subtract fractions because we dont worry about common denominators when we multiply right,1
teacher:I think I have For 4 and 6 I know I have 4 8 12 and for 6 I can 6 12 18 and so I know that 12 would be a common denominator right,1
teacher:We can say we know that 14 is equal to 312 okay,1
teacher:22 right;student:Two,1
teacher:This is 20ths right,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Does everybody understand that all we are doing is multiplying by 1,1
teacher:Am I clear,1
teacher:Its going to be 187 of 5 less than 5 okay,1
teacher:Do you feel like you want to work with me;student:Yes,1
teacher:Youre multiplying by more than 1 right,1
teacher:Is greater;student:The answer is 5 x 2,1
teacher:I want you to tell me what I want to know in as few words as possible but you also need to be clear and specific okay,1
teacher:Everybody say it,1
teacher:Repeat after me,1
teacher:Is that news to anybody,1
teacher:Are any of you thinking that Oh yes of course that is the multiplication rule for finding equivalent fractions right,1
teacher:Did you know that that was a property,1
teacher:Bruce will you read the instructions,1
teacher:This would also read as 12 of 5 right,1
teacher:Tera,1
teacher:Okay like in all cases theres a fraction involved though right,1
teacher:are you with me,1
teacher:Are you listening;student:Well when I multiplied the fraction by a whole number at first I thought that,1
teacher:Would you be like no,1
teacher:You would say no right,1
teacher:If youre taking a fraction of something youre going to end up with less than you started with right,1
teacher:It is;student:Because its a whole fraction,1
teacher:You want to give it a try,1
teacher:Franc,1
teacher:One of those three okay,1
teacher:All right you guys ready;student:She spent 23 of money on,1
teacher:Multiplication right,1
teacher:Oh did you guys hear that;student:Yes our problem was we built a bookshelf that was 6 feet tall and  wide yes,1
teacher:Say it again,1
teacher:Dont tell me tell them;student:We build a bookshelf that,1
teacher:Are you guys thinking about that,1
teacher:The question is can you multiply fractions of a yard by feet and come up with something that is meaningful;student:By six,1
teacher:Michael what do you think,1
teacher:It does,1
teacher:6 feet  2 yards so they converted that first so its 2 yards x 12 yard is the area of their bookshop got it,1
teacher:Table 3,1
teacher:Is that what you are asking,1
teacher:He didnt eat very much pie did he,1
teacher:Andrew does that work,1
teacher:Table 5;student:No too much,1
teacher:Because we are multiplying,1
teacher:Yes will the product be greater than nine Georgia;student:Hes spending some of his money so 23 of his money,1
teacher:Georgia,1
teacher:How about Roberto,1
teacher:We know that 34 is going to be greater than or 34 x 3 is greater than 34 because were taking three of those 34 right,1
teacher:Everybody say Multiplicative identity property,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Do you see what Im saying,1
teacher:Okay say it all together;student:I mean smaller,1
teacher:MIssy can I get you to read the learning intention for me,1
teacher:Yes did you hear that;student:Where two fractions are being multiplied,1
teacher:You guys are you listening,1
teacher:What did he say Asher;student:Yes,1
teacher:Okay will you please stand up;student:I still cant hear it,1
teacher:MIssy,1
teacher:You guys are not taking vacations when other people are talking in the room okay,1
teacher:Margo,1
teacher:Stella,1
teacher:Talk to me more;student:We do the garden when we want to get the size of it,1
teacher:Stella you have to do it,1
teacher:Say it again;student:He said that its a number model of fractions multiplied by whole numbers,1
teacher:What other questions do you have,1
teacher:Give them a high five and say Im excited to work with you on problem number one,1
teacher:Oliver,1
teacher:Does it make sense if we add those together,1
teacher:Does it make sense to add those together,1
teacher:Rita,1
teacher:Does her driving from Florida get any closer to Georgia,1
teacher:Im on the road driving to Kansas right,1
teacher:Does her drive from Florida make me any closer to Georgia,1
teacher:Theyre not part of the same whole are they,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Could I be 13 eighths of the way to my parents house,1
teacher:If I said you drink half your water bottle and then Luke drinks half of your water bottle that would be a whole water bottle wouldnt it,1
teacher:Well you couldnt eat so you couldnt have that much out of the same thing could you;student:What if its like seven eighths and then three eighths that still be something,1
teacher:Isnt it,1
teacher:Bella can you read the top example,1
teacher:This one should say Are you all getting this one,1
teacher:All right what was your question Isaiah,1
teacher:We really can t add dollars and euros because they re not part of the same system are they,1
teacher:It makes you think doesnt it,1
teacher:They re not the same units right,1
teacher:Its going to be 2500 right,1
teacher:How many people feel like their comfort zone their jam is really looking at those fraction circle pieces,1
teacher:Eliza,1
teacher:Julia,1
teacher:Rita,1
teacher:Dylan,1
teacher:Isaiah,1
teacher:Isabel,1
teacher:You could see one half and three fourths and add it to the other like that can you,1
teacher:That easy isn t it but you know what Ive realized,1
teacher:Remember the other day when we had the question and asked you to find the area but nobody found the area you just found the length,1
teacher:Remember the other day when there was a question where you needed to subtract and others added,1
teacher:I think sometimes with 5th graders you get in a habit of Oh we re working on adding fractions so you know what,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Bella,1
teacher:Turn to the person next to you,1
teacher:Remember how I told my cousin was visiting from London for Thanksgiving,1
teacher:Can we use two fifths plus three tenths to show that one,1
teacher:No you know the whole is here,1
teacher:Adam say it again,1
teacher:Bella,1
teacher:Lauren,1
teacher:Is your answers going to be a fraction,1
teacher:Read it again tell me if your answer is going to be a fraction;student:Yes,1
teacher:Adam,1
teacher:Is it going to be a whole number is it going to be a fraction,1
teacher:Riley,1
teacher:Jake,1
teacher:Adam,1
teacher:You know what;student:Estimate,1
teacher:Isaiah,1
teacher:Caroline;student:Show your work so you know,1
teacher:Lauren,1

teacher:Eliza,1
teacher:Dylan,1
teacher:JD,1
teacher:Caroline,1
teacher:You dont know my full expectations do you,1
teacher:So Garret say that again;student:We got to redo the whole question,1
teacher:Make sense,1
teacher:The last thing Im going to do yourexit ticket is going to be can you write your own situation,1
teacher:Can you write your own situation,1
teacher:Your own situation for it okay,1
teacher:Does that make sense when I say write your own situation,1
teacher:Remember how we had the multiplication before,1
teacher:Did anybody use the multiply the denominators trick,1
teacher:Can I get a volunteer to read this paragraph out loud,1
teacher:Jeff,1
teacher:Wait say those again;student:1 12 and 2 and 5 15 of the chocolate bar,1
teacher:Luke,1
teacher:Yes so your answer is going to be a fraction isnt it;student:I also circled fractions part,1
teacher:Rita,1
teacher:Rita can you repeat yourself please,1
teacher:Read B please,1
teacher:What is it Anna,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:You think that tenths is the denominator that we need to convert to right now,1
teacher:Theo;student:No,1
teacher:All right so today what we are going to be working on is were going to be adding and subtracting fractions that dont have the same denominator okay;student:Never mind,1
teacher:Do you remember doing that,1
teacher:Isaiah,1
teacher:28 is the same as 14 right,1
teacher:Is that correct,1
teacher:This is comfortable learning,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Green,1
teacher:All right does that make sense now;student:Okay purple it is,1
teacher:Skyler does that makes sense;student:Yes,1
teacher:Purple;student:Its purple,1
teacher:Did that work with purple,1
teacher:Say that again,1
teacher:You see the difference there,1
teacher:So you see if your answer is reasonable right;student:We estimate so when we do get our answer we can see if its really correct,1
teacher:Bella,1
teacher:Lydia,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:If you look here truthfully it doesnt totally make a circle does it,1
teacher:Frankie whos your partner,1
teacher:Does that make sense;student:That makes sense,1
teacher:Kinsley,1
teacher:Eliza,1
teacher:I know 13  13 is 23 right,1
teacher:Can you picture it in your head,1
teacher:I know some of you want to do this in your head so badly you cant even stand it but I want you to use your fraction sample cases for this one okay;student:Math Message,1
teacher:wasnt it;student:It has to be a different number,1
teacher:What have you been asked to do right now;student:Whats dark blue and light blue,1
teacher:Ezra,1
teacher:Continue to share,1
teacher:You put 28 on top of the 4;student:Then 2  3 would be 4,1
teacher:Then you have one more 18;student:Yes,1
teacher:Then you knew you had 38;student:Yes,1
teacher:Caroline,1
teacher:It kind of works but see if we just had this and try to make a circle out of that it doesnt totally work does it,1
teacher:Okay so have you been using the the fraction circle pieces,1
teacher:Have you been using them,1
teacher:The last one we had What was the last problem we had,1
teacher:Theo did you get it,1
teacher:Owen did you get it,1
teacher:Can you guys look at me for a moment,1
teacher:I went over and helped these gentlemen  use our fraction circle pieces and once you really set the pieces out how much sense did it make,1
teacher:Maybe we shouldnt have gone to  before we had the answer should we,1
teacher:Adam,1
teacher:Remember how I said it is always okay to not know but its not okay to,1
teacher:Lydia,1
teacher:You ended up with 412 on the 13;student:That would be 412,1
teacher:Skyler does that make sense,1
teacher:Skyler does that make more sense,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:So from the talking I hear Im assuming that we have our answer,1
teacher:Is this one feeling easier than the last one,1
teacher:And 12 dont fit because 15 dont fit into a 12 do they;student:That one worked and those are 15,1
teacher:Does that make more sense,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:412;student:412,1
teacher:Just have them next to each other because were adding 13 plus 14 right,1
teacher:Is that something you guys  fractions,1
teacher:12 plus 48 so did you guy get that,1
teacher:Actually how about you solve this first,1
teacher:Josh do you have your answer,1
teacher:You could fit one fraction into the other couldnt you,1
teacher:Isaiah,1
teacher:Can you say that again a little louder,1
teacher:Okay so you think it is 910;student:Yes because,1
teacher:Just can I clarify;student:Okay so I laid out the pink piece and the orange piece and then,1
teacher:So you did 112 plus 112 and you got 1012,1
teacher:Piper,1
teacher:You know how I feel about being able to describe what you did though right;student:So 12 I did I dont know how to describe it,1
teacher:Theo,1
teacher:I think it would be good for us to do a couple more of this what do you guys think,1
teacher:How do what;student:Ms  how do you do the strategy of it again,1
teacher:That Piper was describing,1
teacher:Because thats a 12 and a 13 pink and orange,1
teacher:Raise your hand if youve had pita bread,1
teacher:Sawyer,1
teacher:Rita,1

teacher:The data shows us 12 inches right;student:None,1
teacher:Keep measuring right;student:Stick on line,1
teacher:Charlie,1
teacher:Do you see how we are taking realworld data about meerkats,1
teacher:Then we graph the ordered pairs and we made a line graph;student:Yes,1
teacher:Any questions about that,1
teacher:Once we graph the ordered pairs were we able to answer questions about the data,1
teacher:Eli,1
teacher:Do you remember which is which,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:What I want to ask right now what burning questions do you have,1
teacher:Clara,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Maria,1
teacher:Were also going to be answering some questions about the data you graph in your ordered pairs okay,1
teacher:Nora,1

teacher:Emerson,1
teacher:You know what,1
teacher:Jonathan,1
teacher:Can you say that again;student:From the bottom it goes to 15 and from up it goes one single,1
teacher:What does it say right here,1
teacher:Do you guys see this is an example of how coordinate grids can be helpful for you to organize data;student:Yes,1
teacher:Any thoughts any questions,1
teacher:The denominator;student:When you multiply the mixed number,1
teacher:Rita,1
teacher:Whatever you found for the 15 you multiply by 3 to get to the 35 right;student:That,1
teacher:Have you understand what have I done until this point,1
teacher:Is that pretty straightforward,1

teacher:That was a shortcut wasnt it,1
teacher:Show one and onethird of the pizza,1
teacher:Can I show you guys something real quick,1
teacher:Can I show you something,1
teacher:Drawing a third its not as easy as drawing a half or a fourth is it,1
teacher:This is great and you are awesome but thats why  shown you how the fourthgrade standards have no decimals,1
teacher:Thats pretty close to the middle right,1
teacher:Haley,1
teacher:Do you notice that,1

teacher:Right so you know that see,1
teacher:Remember how we talked about these moments of productive struggle;student:Im done,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1

teacher:Yeung Suk Ping;student:Yes,1
teacher:Lo Chi Hung,1
teacher:Is there any question,1
teacher:Uh Mung Wing Chi,1
teacher:So the answer compared of this equation A is negative three okay,1
teacher:Fung Chi Pui,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Kuba,1
teacher:Kuba,1
teacher:Iveta,1
teacher:Negative 20 squared does not come out to a negative answer but a Kuba,1
teacher:Vasek,1
teacher:Michael,1
teacher:Because the table chart is rounded to the nearest tenth okay,1
teacher:Call up the next person Alenka,1
teacher:On your own or in a group of two please do number 16 right now okay,1
teacher:Dont forget that these problems require that you reserve about 15 percent okay,1
teacher:Height,1
teacher:Do you need an additional minute to complete this do you need it,1
teacher:Excuse me,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:Six;student:Nine,1
teacher:Uh Leung Chi Fu,1
teacher:Is it the same,1
teacher:Kwong Wai Kit;student:Neg negative,1
teacher:Another sign;student:Uh a negative  equation,1
teacher:Its the same okay,1
teacher:Do you have any questions,1
teacher:Okay find this do these two classworks okay,1
teacher:So each of uh each of the questions you can find two answers okay,1
teacher:Did you get two answers,1
teacher:Leung Hoi Chung,1
teacher:Uh Ng Chun Mei,1
teacher:This is to represent a positive value okay,1
teacher:So there are two answers okay,1
teacher:And then for this case it is correct okay,1
teacher:Do you have any questions,1
teacher:Lo Chi Hung,1
teacher:Is it equal equal to negative negative four,1
teacher:So the answer must be positive okay,1
teacher:If the answer is negative only if there is a negative sign uh before the square root okay,1
teacher:So you just combine the two questions okay,1
teacher:La Lai Chi Fu,1
teacher:A must be positive or negative,1
teacher:But now uh is is there any request about A,1
teacher:Choi Ka Yan;student:Six,1
teacher:Six okay;student:Six,1
teacher:Woo Hau Pang,1
teacher:Ng Ka Wing,1
teacher:Cheung Ka Wai,1
teacher:Ten because 10 squared equals 100 okay;student:Ten,1
teacher:To Tsung Him,1
teacher:Jitka,1
teacher:Wong Yee Hung sorry Wong Yee Ling,1
teacher:Hmm,1
teacher:Uh Wong On Tin,1
teacher:Nine;student:Nine,1
teacher:Wong Wai Yan,1
teacher:Chan Wai Yan,1
teacher:Huh;student:Negative,1
teacher:So Chi Yan,1
teacher:Mm,1
teacher:Do you have any questions,1
teacher:Marta,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Which of you had A and B assignments,1
teacher:Is there anyone I did not call up,1
teacher:Which students had C and D assignments,1
teacher:You have what,1
teacher:Okay so youll go with Lubos yes;student:A and B,1
teacher:Which of you have C and D,1
teacher:Okay one of you will go with the girls and the other one will go here okay,1
teacher:Youre supposed to compare the answers and if your results come out different discuss it okay,1
teacher:Which one did you work on,1
teacher:Basically this part is similarly calculated yes,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:How are you doing over here,1
teacher:Were you having any difficulty,1
teacher:You did check the rest of your work yes,1
teacher:Go ahead;student:May I go to the restroom,1
teacher:Once again please raise your hand those of you that have A and B assignments,1
teacher:You may return to your seats okay,1
teacher:So those students that had assignments A and B please raise your hands,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Teresa,1
teacher:Positive number correct;student:One,1
teacher:Lukas,1
teacher:Zero okay;student:Zero,1
teacher:And it is five C to the fourth power isnt it,1
teacher:Youre supposed to change over the expression okay,1
teacher:Youve scratched this out because its not correct yes,1
teacher:Martin is finished,1
teacher:Yes;student:Three,1
teacher:Did you check this one to see if its correct,1
teacher:Are you sure;student:Im satisfied with it,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:May I help you,1
teacher:Excellent and did you finish this part as well;student:Im done with my work,1
teacher:Yes and you crossed it out correct,1
teacher:Im listening,1
teacher:And did you calculate it in dollars;student:and from 16 I got 66176,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Michael Onderzak,1
teacher:Next person,1
teacher:Six times three cubed please erase it and Radka start again;student:Six times three cubed minus four times three cubed,1
teacher:Show me the first one,1
teacher:Read it out,1
teacher:Read the other one;student:Three cubed,1
teacher:Jitka,1
teacher:Ondra,1
teacher:We cant be mixing it up okay;student:X equals,1
teacher:Good next person,1
teacher:Andulka,1
teacher:Is that important;student:Seven squared equals 49,1
teacher:Very good call up the next person;student:Plus two times 10 to the first power plus six times one,1
teacher:Could this have been just two times 10 not 10 to the first power,1
teacher:Is that correct,1
teacher:Whos finished with this problem,1
teacher:Good next person lets hurry up,1
teacher:So do you have it correct or not,1
teacher:Lucka was absent in the first class as well correct;student:Okay,1
teacher:Which you just did in class okay,1
teacher:Do you recall that,1
teacher:Two identical gifts okay,1
teacher:Correct,1
teacher:Do you remember,1
teacher:Anna,1
teacher:We worked with powered numbers that had the same main numbers Vasek,1
teacher:Excuse me;student:Using the pencil,1
teacher:Ondras,1
teacher:Vojta,1
teacher:Vojta,1
teacher:To the sixth power equals is the main number going to be the same Vojta;student:To the sixth power,1
teacher:You can see that the exponents are the same do you see that,1
teacher:Katka,1
teacher:Lucka Maresova,1
teacher:Okay Paul,1
teacher:Jitka,1
teacher:Jana,1
teacher:Who says that it is equal to two,1
teacher:Is it correct,1
teacher:If I turn the one into two then both of them will be two right,1
teacher:Now we have formed a new equation right,1
teacher:Since it is turned into equation number three okay,1
teacher:Lo Pak Man,1
teacher:If you want elimination shouldnt we use subtraction,1
teacher:Use subtraction okay,1
teacher:Two X minus two X is zero okay,1
teacher:Understand,1
teacher:Three Y minus negative four Y okay,1
teacher:Well next this will become seven Y right,1
teacher:Negative 21 right;student:Negative 21,1
teacher:Negative three okay;student:Negative three,1
teacher:Put it into equation two okay,1
teacher:So X minus two times negative three equals 12 okay,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:If the numbers are not the same we can think of some ways to make them bigger right,1
teacher:So they can be subtracted by each other okay,1
teacher:If they were the same number we could find some ways to use addition or subtraction to eliminate is that right,1
teacher:Three Y plus negative two Y right,1
teacher:Is that a one one under the,1
teacher:You did not write that;student:Nothing,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:Are all four questions completed,1
teacher:You have to see if anything will be cancelled right,1
teacher:Here it is for sure that only X will be cancelled right,1
teacher:Finished,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you have not finished,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you have not finished,1
teacher:Raise hand,1
teacher:Are there any questions;student:No the upper one times the lower one,1
teacher:Are there any questions;student:The one on the bottom,1
teacher:Finished yet,1
teacher:Finished,1
teacher:Calculating number four for those of you who have not finished are you doing number four,1
teacher:They are all different right,1
teacher:Chong Fong Wai,1
teacher:So we need to multiply the lower equation by three okay,1
teacher:Understand,1
teacher:Okay can can you get the meaning of of of your thank you thank you your your classmate say,1
teacher:Understand,1
teacher:Okay first of all do you still remember equiangular polygon,1
teacher:Do you still remember it,1
teacher:Get it,1
teacher:Okay can you get the meaning of the uh questions,1
teacher:Can can you get it,1
teacher:Have you finished,1
teacher:Understand,1
teacher:Got the point,1
teacher:Number six,1
teacher:Number six yes,1
teacher:Twenty,1
teacher:Wheres 20,1
teacher:Okay 32,1
teacher:Can we find any angles more than 180 degrees,1
teacher:How how about this polygon;student:Yes,1
teacher:Okay that means uh this angle is more than 180 degrees;student:Yes,1
teacher:More more than 180 degrees;student:Uh more than 180 degrees,1
teacher:One is positive six Y and one is negative six Y okay,1
teacher:Understand,1
teacher:Do you remember,1
teacher:Okay uh boys and girls uh for today we are going to discuss a topic okay,1
teacher:Uh for last Friday I have asked you to prepare for this topic have you read over this chapter,1
teacher:Uh this kind of the uh polygon we call a con a convex polygon okay,1
teacher:Seventeen,1
teacher:Can Y be negative four,1
teacher:You forget it,1
teacher:Anybody,1
teacher:Anybody try,1
teacher:Twentysix,1
teacher:Who is 26,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Can you come out,1
teacher:What what what,1
teacher:Whos 35,1
teacher:Put up your hand,1
teacher:Y can be a negative number right,1
teacher:Did you hear,1
teacher:No problems right,1
teacher:Do you want to do any of the problems,1
teacher:Or do you want me to talk about any of them,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:Do you remember,1
teacher:Is that right,1
teacher:Can you see it,1
teacher:Uh Ho Wai Kwan;student:A,1
teacher:Didnt I mention before that um when there are two unknowns in a question it is impossible to calculate it right,1
teacher:Is that right,1
teacher:Okay if now I want to find out A but B is blocking the way right,1
teacher:The best is to take B away right,1
teacher:Take away B and the remaining A will be easier to calculate right,1
teacher:Kam Mo Lam;student:Zero,1
teacher:Louder,1
teacher:Is the answer correct,1
teacher:Louder;student:Zero,1
teacher:Is the answer correct,1
teacher:Twentyone and 22 are both very easy right,1
teacher:Please put up your hand,1
teacher:Positive,1
teacher:Negative,1
teacher:Or zero,1
teacher:Do you have any questions,1
teacher:Or you can uh read these pag pages now okay,1
teacher:Uh in the next lesson we will learn something about the square root okay,1
teacher:Uh some of you uh try to do the class practice okay,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Yesterday we should have stopped on 22 right,1
teacher:First of all are there any special questions,1
teacher:Are there;student:No,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you have questions;student:No,1
teacher:Are there any questions on question number 20 with the star,1
teacher:There is nothing special about it right;student:No,1
teacher:How to do number 20;student:Can you teach me,1
teacher:Yes zero right;student:Zero,1
teacher:Four minus four plus negative four is equal to zero right,1
teacher:Should it be zero;student:Zero,1
teacher:Now it is three X plus two Y and three X minus two Y right,1
teacher:So now if I eliminate the two Y is there a plus and minus before Y,1
teacher:Is that right,1
teacher:Will become zero right,1
teacher:However are this three X and this three X positive,1
teacher:Eight right,1
teacher:Three X minus three X will be nothing it will become zero right,1
teacher:Will it be zero if this is subtracted from this,1
teacher:Will it become zero,1
teacher:So if you really subtract them from each other it will become two Y minus negative two Y right,1
teacher:You should take take the whole positive two Y minus two negative Y right,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:You have to circle to circle equation one and equation two or else it will be confused as numbers one and two right,1
teacher:One of them is A plus B and the other one is A minus B right,1
teacher:Any questions,1
teacher:Right substitute it back into the equation right;student:Substitute it back into the equation,1
teacher:Get it yet,1
teacher:If it is zero then there is no B right,1
teacher:Twenty plus eight right;student:Eight,1
teacher:Two A right;student:Two A,1
teacher:Siu Hiu Ching;student:Zero,1
teacher:Positive B plus negative B equals to zero right,1
teacher:It should be understood right,1
teacher:A right;student:A,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Is there a B,1
teacher:That is to eliminate B okay,1
teacher:Fourteen right;student:Fourteen,1
teacher:So you will realize the reason why when we are looking for the bigger number A is the bigger number right,1
teacher:When it is the bigger number we need to add the sum to the difference this is the sum and this is the difference the sum added to the difference is this right,1
teacher:The sum added to the difference and then divided by two right,1
teacher:Can you see that,1
teacher:Can you see that,1
teacher:Do you understand,1
teacher:Thirtytwo,1
teacher:Lubo,1
teacher:The problem was comparing two  fractions,1
teacher:Read me what you have;student:Its just like,1
teacher:But its not really a dividing something in a ratio story is it,1
teacher:Danny,1
teacher:Read me what you have please,1
teacher:Did you understand the question Colin,1
teacher:However do you actually think the Mars Bar company would have a ratio of five to six of winners and losers;student:Yep,1
teacher:Is that likely,1
teacher:Emma;student:One to 10,1
teacher:Same thing isnt it,1
teacher:Do they;student:On that on that ad thing they have one to six,1
teacher:So theres a is there an ad;student:It used to be,1
teacher:Is that right,1
teacher:Jessica,1
teacher:Michelle,1
teacher:The unitary one,1
teacher:Danny,1
teacher:Who else,1
teacher:Who else was there,1
teacher:Have you finished,1
teacher:Thats a different question isnt it,1
teacher:Lindsey,1
teacher:So I had some Smarties and person A stole some,1
teacher:Marbles surfboards;student:Marbles,1
teacher:Tanya,1
teacher:Sam,1
teacher:Pardon,1
teacher:In a shop;student:In a shop,1
teacher:Might have been better to knock off a zero in that story perhaps eh,1
teacher:You cant work it out;student:I didnt get to work my ratio out Miss,1
teacher:Is it,1
teacher:So 80 divided by 24 is 10 80 over 24 theyre both divide by eight arent they,1
teacher:Can you work that out in your head,1
teacher:Follow what Im saying,1
teacher:Isnt that right,1
teacher:So the 55000 would actually be the answer so it would have been better left out of the question wouldnt it,1
teacher:Finished,1
teacher:Which question is it;student:Four of them,1
teacher:One share,1
teacher:Do you have it or anyone found a problem,1
teacher:Is it good,1
teacher:Are you finished,1
teacher:May I start,1
teacher:Everybody knows what an easel looks like,1
teacher:Everybody has seen an easel,1
teacher:Everybody knows what an easel looks like,1
teacher:Can you imagine a picture,1
teacher:Katka,1
teacher:So whos ready,1
teacher:How are we doing,1
teacher:So its just George nobody else,1
teacher:So Tomas,1
teacher:So who has any answer raise your hand,1
teacher:Kamila what is it,1
teacher:And loud Dan you have to speak out loud so we can understand what youre saying,1
teacher:Is it going to be the length of the diagonal,1
teacher:Already yourself,1
teacher:Did anyone have a problem;student:Yes,1
teacher:Four twenty divided by 12;student:Thirtyfive,1
teacher:You right now then;student:They got the answer,1
teacher:None,1
teacher:Itll be easier wont it,1
teacher:And one out of six weve got 16 or so isnt it,1
teacher:Sixteen and two thirds,1
teacher:So youre going to have a different number here to six arent you,1
teacher:Bobbie Jo,1
teacher:Thirteen;student:Thirteen,1
teacher:Byron,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Oh then thats where you probably youve got a;student:Just six and three,1
teacher:So Marcela talk,1
teacher:So did you enter it in the calculator correctly Marcela,1
teacher:Okay okay so its six point you said eight;student:Six point eight  nine four,1
teacher:Any problems so far,1
teacher:Anybody have 14,1
teacher:George,1
teacher:Nicole first,1
teacher:If 204 shares is two 408 dollars one share is only two dollars isnt it,1
teacher:You understand what Im doing,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Anybody got any questions;student:Mm hm,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Beg your pardon;student:Um,1
teacher:Whos to say whether that is twentyeight point five or twentyeight point six,1
teacher:Do you follow what I mean,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Everyone at that stage,1
teacher:You have now deleted all information from list one yes,1
teacher:This is for the data were going to work on your chocolate chip cookie one right,1
teacher:If we if we put these chocolate chips into the mixture and mixed them around we would expect them to get mixed a little bit and not sit in one corner wouldnt we,1
teacher:Twentynine;student:Twentynine,1
teacher:The mean;student:The mean,1
teacher:Yep,1
teacher:If you have created your scale and your scale is starting at 20 and going up to 44 right,1
teacher:Okay so youre going to select the larger number and just ensure that youre going to end up with the three yeah;student:Cause its the largest number  get,1
teacher:But now youve gotta show what these actual points are right,1
teacher:Yes thats right but you now have to show what scale the scale that you used on the actual line there dont you;student:So thats not right,1
teacher:Now we havent used one of our pieces of data as the actual median have we;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Anyone not finished,1
teacher:No you first of all are going to have to draw up your own scale arent you,1
teacher:Now is your scale is your scale going to start at zero,1
teacher:If it does imagine the length of the scale that youre going to need right;student:No,1
teacher:Twentyone;student:Twentyone,1
teacher:Miles,1
teacher:Yep,1
teacher:No your scale is just going to indicate those individual scores isnt it,1
teacher:Why would it;student:Why would it be better to start at 21 than 22,1
teacher:Dont forget once you have completed drawing your your plot then you must show those five points on that scale yes,1
teacher:Now youve gotta On your plot youre going to have to show those five numbers yes,1
teacher:And what Im saying is is there any need to include from zero up to 22 on your scale,1
teacher:Theres not is it,1
teacher:Not no you dont have to but that is the reason why when we do these box plots yeah;student:23 24 25,1
teacher:That looks all right yes,1
teacher:What about if you were a chocolate chip cookie manufacturer yeah,1
teacher:Theres no fellow sitting there poking in the same number of uh chips is there,1
teacher:So are you telling me that they weigh every cookie;student:If they if its under then well what they do is they just mix it up so that even if its a different size or shape it still weighs the same,1
teacher:Do you want a hand,1
teacher:Hmm,1
teacher:You right,1
teacher:Did you have you swapped,1
teacher:Still,1
teacher:See;student:How do you,1
teacher:Does nine go into 121,1
teacher:Are we all right then;student:She had to,1
teacher:Is that just about enough time,1
teacher:How did you guys go,1
teacher:You got it right,1
teacher:Pardon,1
teacher:Twentyfive to one dividing them both now wait a second youre dividing them both by four arent you;student:Twentyfive,1
teacher:So isnt it 50 to one,1
teacher:Are you making up the question or are you doing his question,1
teacher:Have you finished doing your friends question yet,1
teacher:Do you have to restrict yourself to dollars,1
teacher:A hundred to one;student:Forty a hundred to one,1
teacher:Bobbie Jo,1
teacher:Is he;student:And hes a quality manufacturer,1
teacher:There were there were a couple of scores there like the 42 and the 43 that mentioned who got the 42;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Those those two scores seem very high compared to the rest yes;student:We got,1
teacher:Beg your pardon,1
teacher:So you need to try to be reasonably quick about taking Twelve,1
teacher:Lindsey you can take any spares and put them in the box and bring the box to the front okay,1
teacher:Follow that,1
teacher:Nicole,1
teacher:Ashley,1
teacher:Its starting to seem really easy now isnt it,1
teacher:What is it Tanya,1
teacher:Would it be equal to 30,1
teacher:Worked it out Mark,1
teacher:Is that what youre saying,1
teacher:Nicole;student:So the eight would be,1
teacher:Do you follow whats going on,1
teacher:Finished,1
teacher:Marcela,1
teacher:Martina,1
teacher:Dan,1
teacher:Martin,1
teacher:G and H you dont have one yet;student:I already have G,1
teacher:Do you have one,1
teacher:Which assignment do you have;student:Teacher so I can go up,1
teacher:So who has done the letter A,1
teacher:No one else has the letter A;student:Me,1
teacher:Excuse me;student:I will do letter A,1
teacher:Who has the letter C,1
teacher:I did not assign the letter F to anyone,1
teacher:Excuse me;student:I have that one,1
teacher:Which problem do you have,1
teacher:Now Denisa will go up to the board,1
teacher:You will do C and what else;student:I have done the letter C as well,1
teacher:Yes;student:Teacher,1
teacher:What does it say,1
teacher:Lubo,1
teacher:Excuse me,1
teacher:Go ahead;student:The third power,1
teacher:Number two is an exponent;student:No,1
teacher:One more time;student:I know it like this,1
teacher:Do you all understand,1
teacher:Eric,1
teacher:If youre having troubles remembering it you may look it up on page 44,1
teacher:Is it clear,1
teacher:Is it hard,1
teacher:Good next person Nik,1
teacher:Jana,1
teacher:Do you all understand it,1
teacher:You,1
teacher:Do you all understand,1
teacher:To the nearest hundredth yes,1
teacher:Nikolai,1
teacher:Marcela,1
teacher:Number five is an exponent;student:Exponent,1
teacher:Jana come up here and write it up on the left side of the board;student:No,1
teacher:Veronika,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Jarko,1
teacher:Excuse me,1
teacher:Jarka;student:Zero point four to the ten thousandths,1
teacher:Raise your hand and speak up so I can hear you,1
teacher:Paul,1
teacher:Rosta;student:Negative 25,1
teacher:Veronika,1
teacher:Please read this part for me,1
teacher:Denisa,1
teacher:Jarko,1
teacher:So use it to answer the questions and just write the answers okay,1
teacher:Youre done;student:Im done,1
teacher:Good is it working out for you Paul,1
teacher:Why dont you start Lubo,1
teacher:Paul,1
teacher:Marcela,1
teacher:Go ahead Jana,1
teacher:Excuse me,1
teacher:Jana,1
teacher:Mike please read number four,1
teacher:Lukas,1
teacher:Excuse me;student:Nine minus four,1
teacher:Paul,1
teacher:Dennis;student:One,1
teacher:Once again I want to know which two numbers are calculated Go ahead Jana,1
teacher:Dennis;student:Sixteen minus five,1
teacher:Minus 21;student:Four minus 25 equals minus 21,1
teacher:Come up here Martin,1
teacher:Is it in fact one,1
teacher:Excuse me,1
teacher:Can you repeat it Martin,1
teacher:Excuse me,1
teacher:Who did that problem,1
teacher:Excuse me,1
teacher:Go ahead Nicole,1
teacher:Go ahead Jana;student:Ten minus 12,1
teacher:Isnt it negative one,1
teacher:So where didnt I go so far,1
teacher:Martin,1
teacher:You take a circumference mark a point on it and you let it roll yes,1
teacher:So is everything okay,1
teacher:Did you have any problems,1
teacher:And Janas going to start,1
teacher:Come on Jana,1
teacher:Are you sure Jana;student:So the parenthesis come first so its eight divided by four by four is 16 is eight divided by 16 minus two,1
teacher:Jonas,1
teacher:Zero point five Jana;student:Zero point five,1
teacher:What about you,1
teacher:So do you all have it,1
teacher:Can we do another one,1
teacher:So do we all have it,1
teacher:Any problems,1
teacher:Read it,1
teacher:Do you have it,1
teacher:Raise your hand how were doing whos already done,1
teacher:Martina,1
teacher:Petra,1
teacher:Jonas,1
teacher:Katka,1
teacher:Yes Jonas,1

teacher:So whos work havent I seen;student:I have already,1
teacher:Who else,1
teacher:So Tom what does it look like back there,1
teacher:Are you done,1
teacher:Can we look at it,1
teacher:So where didnt I go,1
teacher:So Tomas can we take a look,1
teacher:So can we start,1
teacher:So Marcela you start,1
teacher:Zuzko,1
teacher:Yes that is 40 Dan;student:Four plus three times two squared that equals four plus six squared is equal to 40,1
teacher:Petra,1
teacher:Katka,1
teacher:Take another one,1
teacher:First we have to subtract and when we have the answer well raise it to a certain power okay;student:The last one,1
teacher:Teresa,1
teacher:Do you understand that,1
teacher:Paul,1
teacher:Nicolie,1
teacher:I think you overdid it with that one wouldnt you say;student:A to the second power plus B to the second power,1
teacher:Excuse me,1
teacher:You also know how to figure out a triangle yes,1
teacher:John,1
teacher:Excuse me;student:Radius,1
teacher:Michael,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes but,1
teacher:So when I inscribe it when should I do it,1
teacher:Would you be able to do something else,1
teacher:Stanley,1
teacher:Do you remember,1
teacher:Is it going to be three,1
teacher:Is it going to be four,1
teacher:Perimeter of a square youll be able to remember that yes;student:Square,1
teacher:The last one;student:So the,1
teacher:And four of them;student:Eight,1
teacher:Four point zero,1
teacher:Lucko read the next one,1
teacher:So how is it going,1
teacher:Who has everything,1
teacher:Katko,1
teacher:Marketa;student:Its equal to six,1
teacher:So Dan read the next one,1
teacher:Karin,1
teacher:Okay in order to wrap this up did we discover a direct proportion,1
teacher:Alino,1
teacher:Dado,1
teacher:Yes we have to have the parenthesis here so lets move on Katka;student:We have to have them,1
teacher:Sure so where are we;student:Its commutative,1
teacher:Zuzko,1
teacher:So Zuzko are the parenthesis necessary there;student:Fifteen times two plus nine times two is equal to 48,1
teacher:Are they necessary or not,1
teacher:So Petro are you checking signs,1
teacher:Jitko,1
teacher:Dont forget when we are finding the median we had the full 14 pieces of data yes,1
teacher:Thirtytwo,1
teacher:Yeah you,1
teacher:Since we want to lose this angle so this hm isnt it a little bent,1
teacher:Did you get it,1
teacher:and then we want to get rid of this angle right,1
teacher:It disappears right;student:It disappears,1
teacher:And if you get one on this side then this time cant you also get it on this side;student:Yes,1
teacher:Hm;student:Is it okay to change some,1
teacher:You found a new one,1
teacher:Then would you draw it then like this,1
teacher:Can you shrink it,1
teacher:Well you dont understand it well;student:Uh well,1
teacher:But you were able to do it,1
teacher:You made this triangle and this the same right,1
teacher:Then cant you get one on this side,1
teacher:You dont understand it well;student:Still how do I get it,1
teacher:Is it okay,1
teacher:If there is one on this side then how about this side,1
teacher:There is something like this here right,1
teacher:Also,1
teacher:Here if you make this straight like this then this angle disappears right,1
teacher:You cut it doing like this doing it like this into two doing it like this right;student:Huh,1
teacher:The triangle is over here right,1
teacher:If you cut it like this then here with this one diagonal line would you get a triangle just over here;student:Then also over here,1
teacher:Is it just over here;student:Over here is also,1
teacher:Wont it extend to this side,1
teacher:You noticed things like this on this side right,1
teacher:This area and over here are the same right,1
teacher:Isnt there anything like this over here okay,1
teacher:Hm;student:Oh oh oh,1
teacher:Its over here huh,1
teacher:If there is a right side then there is a left side also right,1
teacher:Then triangles that are the same with this area are hm there are a lot of these right,1
teacher:All you have to do is get rid of it right;student:Get rid of it,1
teacher:Its an interesting thought huh,1
teacher:Thats good huh,1
teacher:This is one answer right,1
teacher:A triangle huh,1
teacher:If you look at it like this then its a triangle and parallel lines right,1
teacher:all we have to do is reduce the angles by one right,1
teacher:Then this becomes a triangle right,1
teacher:Do you understand,1
teacher:The problem,1
teacher:Are you okay,1
teacher:Is there another one,1
teacher:Oh youre making two triangles huh,1
teacher:Hm,1
teacher:If you draw a line wh where then would you get a triangle,1
teacher:Its like this right,1
teacher:Its like this or like this huh,1
teacher:Whats up,1
teacher:First of all this is correct huh;student:Still only two,1
teacher:Chiba;student:Im not scary,1
teacher:You got two right;student:Two,1
teacher:Youre done right,1
teacher:This has become straight right,1
teacher:This triangle and this triangle are the same right,1
teacher:The area of the triangle over here is the same right,1
teacher:How about a triangle like this;student:Also what do I do,1
teacher:Then is this the only triangle that we can get,1
teacher:Thats right huh,1
teacher:You can also do that right,1
teacher:Hm;student:Can I also do that,1
teacher:The diagonal line isnt done okay,1
teacher:You made a mistake;student:Just now I made a little mistake,1
teacher:Huh;student:Like this like this,1
teacher:Isnt there one more parallel line a triangle,1
teacher:You drew it like this;student:I dont understand this,1
teacher:It doesnt look straight okay;student:Straight,1
teacher:You dont know anymore;student:I dont know yet up to where I did,1
teacher:The reasons,1
teacher:So all you have to do is get rid of one angle okay,1
teacher:Is better over here,1
teacher:For example when this becomes straight how about it,1
teacher:If it becomes like this,1
teacher:This is where its supposed to be straight okay;student:Huh,1
teacher:Its good okay,1
teacher:If you have drawn it on this side okay,1
teacher:You drew this and this,1
teacher:A triangle has been made right,1
teacher:Then okay,1
teacher:Hm,1
teacher:For example do you want to think about it with the triangle over he over here;student:Huh,1
teacher:Thats right huh,1
teacher:Thats right huh,1
teacher:Are there anymore other than this one,1
teacher:The fact that you can get one on this side means that then if we extend it a little like this then huh,1
teacher:The fact that you got one like this means that cant you make one on this side,1
teacher:Are you done;student:Teacher,1
teacher:Yes;student:Teacher,1
teacher:Hm;student:Is it okay with one,1
teacher:Is one all you made;student:With one zero,1
teacher:In all,1
teacher:Hum;student:I can get it over here and over here from this,1
teacher:Thats sharp huh,1
teacher:And cant you make a triangle over here that is the same as this,1
teacher:Thats right huh,1
teacher:Huh;student:Teacher the one we call the triangle isnt just one,1
teacher:You dont understand,1
teacher:You dont understand;student:I also dont understand,1
teacher:People who didnt understand it please listen to it closely okay,1
teacher:So we want to do it so this here becomes straight like this okay,1
teacher:The angle okay,1
teacher:People who were able to d who did it like this,1
teacher:People who can say I drew it like this over here,1
teacher:People who say I was able to draw it,1
teacher:People who say I was able to do it like this way,1
teacher:People who say they were able to do both,1
teacher:Next uhm using this as a foundation okay,1
teacher:You cant do it with it just as it is right,1
teacher:Its a quadrilateral right,1
teacher:If its just as it is its a quadrilateral right,1
teacher:If everybody had a triangle and parallel lines then they can do it huh,1
teacher:It may be that you can get many types huh;student:In addition,1
teacher:You can get it on the opposite side right,1
teacher:Are you going to make it into an upright state;student:I got it,1
teacher:Are you going to fold it like this,1
teacher:Do you understand,1
teacher:Here and here are the same right,1
teacher:This okay,1
teacher:How about this side,1
teacher:Cant we make somewhere,1
teacher:Straight like this,1
teacher:Are you done,1
teacher:What is it;student:Teacher,1
teacher:Snobbishly,1
teacher:If it has become this then can we do it,1
teacher:You cant do it as it is a quadrilateral,1
teacher:Dont you have to draw a parallel line to the triangle;student:Here,1
teacher:Im sorry okay,1
teacher:Then where is the tri quadrilateral oh triangle thats equal to the area here,1
teacher:Since its parallel like this so in the parallel lines where is the qua thats equal to here,1
teacher:You get a triangle like this;student:Draw a parallel line and,1
teacher:Its reduced by one right,1
teacher:It becomes three right;student:Three,1
teacher:Youve gotten to a good place in the problem huh,1
teacher:If you have folded this then okay,1
teacher:It wont at least overlap right,1
teacher:Then okay,1
teacher:If this corner for example its good if the corner here was gone right;student:Yes,1
teacher:Ill draw a line longer here okay,1
teacher:Things like these dr are also the same right,1
teacher:Things like these are also the same right,1
teacher:Then okay,1
teacher:Theres a lot right,1
teacher:We have to make it straight right,1
teacher:Are there any others,1
teacher:You can also do this side right,1
teacher:If you notice this one then okay;student:Is it okay with this,1
teacher:Youll also notice the one over here huh,1
teacher:Youll notice it right,1
teacher:Ohba how are you doing,1
teacher:All you have to do is decrease it right;student:Reduce,1
teacher:Is there anybody who does not understand;student:You understand,1
teacher:Then is it over with these with two,1
teacher:This side,1
teacher:There were some who were doing it already labeled them but okay,1
teacher:We will make them A B C D okay,1
teacher:And right now in the beginning we draw a diagonal line through A to C and draw a diagonal line from A to C and we will make a triangl we were able to make two right,1
teacher:draw a diagonal line from A to C and we will make a triangl we were able to make two right,1
teacher:And uhm if you ask which ones are the triangles we found that go through this D are this and this right,1
teacher:Since this triangle and the original triangle are the same so it becomes a fact that we changed this um quadrilateral into a shape like this right,1
teacher:Those are this and this okay,1
teacher:Is everything okay,1
teacher:About how many people are there who says he or she found this i were able to find it,1
teacher:There are about the same number of people huh,1
teacher:Um how about this one,1
teacher:How about this one,1
teacher:What is it,1
teacher:You dont understand,1
teacher:Ones that we drew through B D and drew a parallel line through vertex A are this and this okay,1
teacher:I think we dont have the top one see;student:Here,1
teacher:Those are the triangle that we make on this side and the triangle we make on the top right,1
teacher:Its this right;student:I dont understand,1
teacher:There are only seven see,1
teacher:These then are quadrilaterals right,1
teacher:Do you want to do them all at once,1
teacher:Do you want to do them all at once,1
teacher:Who was that who said he or she found eight;student:So what,1
teacher:Next okay,1
teacher:Challenge to change a pentagon okay,1
teacher:You found it did you,1
teacher:One huh,1
teacher:Also isnt there one like this,1
teacher:There isnt one on this side right,1
teacher:Is there one like this,1
teacher:Is it this,1
teacher:Is it this,1
teacher:Is it over with this;student:The line have the lines have become messy,1
teacher:Are all of them there;student:There are even ten quadrangles,1
teacher:Is it this;student:The top of this one is this right,1
teacher:Is there none,1
teacher:Is this it,1
teacher:Its wrong,1
teacher:Ichiro has more right,1
teacher:Of course right,1
teacher:Ichiro still has more huh,1
teacher:Now the fact is they continued things like this every day okay,1
teacher:But in the morning of some day okay,1
teacher:They looked inside of each others wallets right,1
teacher:Well this part well be writing in later on so writing anywhere other than here is fine so um okay,1
teacher:Masa,1
teacher:You did it up to the second day right,1
teacher:This one has more,1
teacher:Now just now see,1
teacher:You did it up to the second day right,1
teacher:Do it the same way over here okay,1
teacher:Up to the second day this one has mor had more right,1
teacher:Do it like that then decide the answer okay,1
teacher:They put them in this offertory box right,1
teacher:Every morning from each wallet they take out one coin from each okay,1
teacher:In terms of the amount of money he has more right,1
teacher:This means in the beginning stages um Ichiro has more okay,1
teacher:Is this it,1
teacher:This,1
teacher:Is it,1
teacher:Okay then for the time being okay,1
teacher:I will explain it a little okay,1
teacher:Then there are a lot of them like this which are the same area as this triangle okay,1
teacher:The angle here okay,1
teacher:You found them;student:Yes,1
teacher:Its impossible;student:Thats impossible,1
teacher:Youll make a circle into a triangle;student:A circle,1
teacher:Its wonderful huh,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:This is Ichiros wallet okay,1
teacher:And also there is an offertory box there right,1
teacher:Now first well start looking at Ichiros okay,1
teacher:If we look at the wallet there are only 10yen coins in there right,1
teacher:A circle;student:We well they were talking about doing a circle,1
teacher:Then how about this side,1
teacher:Were all of them found,1
teacher:You want to make a hexagon into a triangle,1
teacher:Then okay;student:Hm,1
teacher:There are parallel lines like this right,1
teacher:If the one that is the same as this triangle is this then also at this side you got it huh,1
teacher:You want to do it,1
teacher:Then would you do one of a different type,1
teacher:Eight;student:Eight,1
teacher:You noticed the fact that there are eight,1
teacher:Thats good huh,1
teacher:This and one like this and one like this huh,1
teacher:Now then is it just this side where we can draw parallel lines,1
teacher:You can also draw them over here right;student:This side,1
teacher:Then cant you transform this triangle,1
teacher:This okay,1
teacher:You did it so it says this triangle and the triangle over here are the same right,1
teacher:Is it just this side where you can get it,1
teacher:Over here huh,1
teacher:Hm;student:Over here also,1
teacher:You found ones like these,1
teacher:Are you done,1
teacher:Isnt there one thats the same as this triangle,1
teacher:Are you worried thinking about it,1
teacher:You were able to get one;student:One,1
teacher:This okay,1
teacher:You got it right,1
teacher:You got something like this right,1
teacher:One that is the same as this is this right;student:Yes,1
teacher:Is the area that is the same as this triangle just this;student:Yes,1
teacher:Is it this,1
teacher:Thats good huh,1
teacher:You can right;student:I can,1
teacher:With that for now it will be two methods right,1
teacher:Did you understand the meaning;student:It doesnt look like it,1
teacher:Then is it just this side where we can draw parallel lines,1
teacher:You can draw it right;student:Over here,1
teacher:Two;student:Only two yet,1
teacher:On this side;student:Over here,1
teacher:We can do it right;student:We can do it,1
teacher:Then we can do it over here right,1
teacher:Lastly would you do it for us okay,1
teacher:You dont understand,1
teacher:You got one here right,1
teacher:These are parallel right;student:What is it,1
teacher:This triangle and the triangle over here are the same right,1
teacher:See,1
teacher:We can get it there right,1
teacher:You noticed a lot huh,1
teacher:First of all this is one right,1
teacher:Two right,1
teacher:Now then this time is drawing diagonal lines just on this side,1
teacher:Other than this side cant you get a triangle,1
teacher:A way to partition it,1
teacher:Even on this side its good if you think about it in the same way okay,1
teacher:What;student:I was able to make a hexagon into a triangle,1
teacher:This,1
teacher:Is it okay;student:Thats terrible of you,1
teacher:We can get it over here also right,1
teacher:Then do you get it only on this side;student:Yes,1
teacher:Then how about this,1
teacher:Is it just this side where we can do it,1
teacher:We can do this side also right;student:This side,1
teacher:How about this,1
teacher:This is you drew it like this and oh you drew it like this;student:No,1
teacher:This is good huh,1
teacher:This its the same as this huh,1
teacher:Since you Phuse are asking for it lets do it okay;student:Actually I dont want to,1
teacher:Draw over here and you can do this right,1
teacher:Did you get one,1
teacher:You were close in getting the other huh,1
teacher:Its okay right,1
teacher:You got one right,1
teacher:Then these are parallel right;student:Yes,1
teacher:This is parallel right,1
teacher:Then the triangle and this orangecolored object is the same right;student:Yes,1
teacher:You found eight,1
teacher:Wheres 19,1
teacher:We can understand enough right,1
teacher:Pay attention okay,1
teacher:Is there any question,1
teacher:Do you remember what they were,1
teacher:Are you done,1
teacher:Can I ask,1
teacher:People who solved it,1
teacher:Okay then Arai,1
teacher:Did you extend it like this,1
teacher:This;student:That is 50 degrees so,1
teacher:Not a straight line,1
teacher:Is this okay,1
teacher:About five people,1
teacher:Okay Bunya,1
teacher:Okay please go ahead,1
teacher:Oops;student:Draw a parallel line,1
teacher:One person Chika,1
teacher:Any more questions,1
teacher:Just Doi,1
teacher:Understand,1
teacher:Understand,1
teacher:Identity,1
teacher:Identity;student:Identity,1
teacher:Do you think that we try all the values for X,1
teacher:It will be always true okay,1
teacher:Are they identities,1
teacher:Or are they just equations,1
teacher:Are they equal;student:Minus 12,1
teacher:How about some helper,1
teacher:So Wing Chung,1
teacher:How about the bracket,1
teacher:How about the righthand side,1
teacher:After simplification you have two expanded forms are they equal,1
teacher:But of course now it is not the same negative 10 positive 10 okay,1
teacher:Then can we say that it is an identity,1
teacher:Or you complete this okay,1
teacher:Use the method okay,1
teacher:Are there any more,1
teacher:There are always at least two or three of you thinking about it;student:Eda difficult,1
teacher:It isnt okay if you try to solve it yourself and find it can be solved right,1
teacher:Its probably right,1
teacher:Which one is that group three,1
teacher:Which number,1
teacher:Number four;student:Number four,1
teacher:Can it be solved,1
teacher:Youre able to solve it;student:It can be solved,1
teacher:What number,1
teacher:Imai is X here,1
teacher:They really seem challenging huh;student:I got it,1
teacher:Are there any groups that were able to solve them,1
teacher:People who are done solving the problem from group one,1
teacher:Group twos,1
teacher:Group threes,1
teacher:Group fours,1
teacher:Group fives,1
teacher:Can this be solved;student:It can it can be solved teacher,1
teacher:Next whos next,1
teacher:Is this all;student:It seems,1
teacher:Number four can you really solve it;student:Number four,1
teacher:What;student:Is this okay for the first one,1
teacher:Here;student:For this it is for this,1
teacher:Are you done writing;student:At 15 you can do it,1
teacher:Are you finished,1
teacher:Is it solvable,1
teacher:Cant it be solved,1
teacher:Who made this;student:A quadrilateral,1
teacher:Therefore will they be always the same,1
teacher:Can they do it or not,1
teacher:From which group,1
teacher:This one;student:From group number five,1
teacher:This which group;student:Here teacher,1
teacher:What group,1
teacher:Group one;student:Group one,1
teacher:Group one,1
teacher:Which number,1
teacher:Whose is it,1
teacher:Group sixs,1
teacher:Lefthand side is it expanded form,1
teacher:Expanded form okay;student:Expanded form,1
teacher:Twentyfive,1
teacher:Uh 35 25 and 35,1
teacher:Can you get it,1
teacher:In do you still remember,1
teacher:Yes anybody;student:Square,1
teacher:Still remember,1
teacher:How many of you remember,1
teacher:Put up your hand,1
teacher:Still remem onl only one,1
teacher:Do you still remember this word,1
teacher:Do you still remember it,1
teacher:Anybody like,1
teacher:Number 13,1
teacher:Wheres number 13,1
teacher:Okay and then number 21,1
teacher:Your class have no 25,1
teacher:Seventeen,1
teacher:No 42,1
teacher:It is equilateral and it is equiangular,1
teacher:Okay get it,1
teacher:Do you find that this angle is greater than 180 degrees,1
teacher:Okay how about this one,1
teacher:Can you find that the uh length between these two sides are different,1
teacher:Can you get the point,1
teacher:Number 10,1
teacher:Number seven,1
teacher:Huh,1
teacher:Can you get it,1
teacher:Can you get it,1
teacher:Okay how about this one,1
teacher:Can you get it,1
teacher:Do you find that uh uh the shape of this two fivesided polygons are different,1
teacher:Can you get it,1
teacher:Can you,1
teacher:Fortytwo,1
teacher:Have you have you worked out the answer,1
teacher:Okay can you work out the sum it is equal to 360 degrees,1
teacher:Do you find that it is equal to uh A one plus A two plus angle B plus B angle C is equal to C one plus C two can you get it,1
teacher:Sorry;student:Anything,1
teacher:We have two and three okay,1
teacher:Are the two sides equal,1
teacher:For the lefthand side it is,1
teacher:This time it is two times eight is it equal,1
teacher:Test for the lefthand side and righthand side okay,1
teacher:Are they equal,1
teacher:Its better not to use a calculator okay,1
teacher:Have all of you finished,1
teacher:Uh okay Mak Pui Ling,1
teacher:Then is the lefthand side equal to the righthand side;student:Equals 10,1
teacher:Sung Wai Ling okay,1
teacher:Therefore do you think that they are equal;student:Lefthand side equals eight righthand side equals eight,1
teacher:This time Lee Shan,1
teacher:Do you think it is only five,1
teacher:Any one of you say that there is no solution,1
teacher:Do you think that there is no solution,1
teacher:Are they the same,1
teacher:It is two X plus four okay,1
teacher:Can you get it,1
teacher:And do you find that A one plus C one plus D is equal to 180 degrees,1
teacher:Uh is it done by you,1
teacher:Uh is it done by you;student:Okay,1
teacher:It is not done by you,1
teacher:It is A B C D E is it,1
teacher:What does it say for question A,1
teacher:Factorized form okay,1
teacher:The number of sides of a pentagon and the sum of interior angle of that pentagon okay,1
teacher:Any,1
teacher:None of you,1
teacher:Kwan Chi Chung please,1
teacher:Chow Suk Fun,1
teacher:Two;student:Two,1
teacher:Yeung Cho Yee,1
teacher:Negative 10 okay,1
teacher:Got it,1
teacher:Go ahead;student:Jimbo,1
teacher:Group sixs,1
teacher:Okay do you want to try it again;student:Number eight,1
teacher:Its not involved right,1
teacher:Right now only here is involved right,1
teacher:Did you get it,1
teacher:Please go ahead;student:Anything,1
teacher:Please go ahead;student:Huh,1
teacher:Bottom;student:From bottom to top is,1
teacher:From right to left,1
teacher:Of course it can be said right;student:Is it not okay with from the top,1
teacher:Its the same even from the top right;student:It is okay from the top,1
teacher:The area okay,1
teacher:Okay go ahead,1
teacher:Then Ill draw it for you so okay,1
teacher:Hm;student:Pick me,1
teacher:Assistance okay,1
teacher:Next okay,1
teacher:Over here is the same from the beginning okay,1
teacher:Chiba,1
teacher:Do you understand what I am saying,1
teacher:Then when it goes to here does it become a straight line,1
teacher:You can get a lot of  huh,1
teacher:Hamada,1
teacher:Hm;student:Here,1
teacher:Ikeda;student:Why,1
teacher:Ikeda,1
teacher:Mos have you finished most of it,1
teacher:How about the height,1
teacher:Jimbo,1
teacher:Please go ahead;student:Huh,1
teacher:This is okay;student:Yes,1
teacher:Do you get it;student:Thats right huh,1
teacher:You wont get any numbers right,1
teacher:Hm,1
teacher:The triangle is the one that moves okay;student:I dont understand what you are saying,1
teacher:So a triangle like this becomes a triangle like this;student:The triangle,1
teacher:Its at the end of the  right;student:Oh,1
teacher:In the meantime today since Chiba you are the main character right,1
teacher:Youre cool okay,1
teacher:Huh,1
teacher:Its bent right,1
teacher:That means that for example when you have drawn it like this okay,1
teacher:Since its bent like this okay,1
teacher:It seems to be sma smaller huh;student:Over here,1
teacher:Doesnt it seem somewhat that they are the same huh,1
teacher:Seems somewhat,1
teacher:It doesnt seem like it;student:Yes,1
teacher:If this is parallel then dont you think its okay with this,1
teacher:They arent parallel right;student:Oh,1
teacher:They are bent like this right,1
teacher:In a figure like this okay,1
teacher:For example if there is one like this and okay,1
teacher:Are the areas of the triangles the same,1
teacher:Its okay if this and this are the same right;student:The end and the end are the same and,1
teacher:Its okay if this and this are the same right,1
teacher:Its bent right,1
teacher:This isnt parallel right,1
teacher:Is it okay,1
teacher:This is okay;student:I cant do it even with this,1
teacher:Do the ones that are wrong;student:Do the ones that are wrong because,1
teacher:Huh;student:I dont mean that,1
teacher:That is okay,1
teacher:Huh;student:Why,1
teacher:Because okay,1
teacher:Huh,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:And theyre parallel right,1
teacher:You shifted th this to this side like this huh,1
teacher:Whats up;student:I wont do it,1
teacher:Kada,1
teacher:Whats up,1
teacher:Were you able to do it,1
teacher:Lai right,1
teacher:You got it right,1
teacher:Is this just this side,1
teacher:Up to this side right,1
teacher:Is it group one or group two;student:I just finally got it,1
teacher:You got a triangle here right,1
teacher:What is it,1
teacher:And these two peoples uhm border line is bent like this but we want to make it straight okay;student:Yes,1
teacher:Bando,1
teacher:Is it okay with it around here,1
teacher:Is that okay;student:Yes,1
teacher:Then well end todays class okay,1
teacher:Chiba is it okay with it around here,1
teacher:No;student:Ahhh,1
teacher:A little more over here,1
teacher:More over here;student:More,1
teacher:Bando,1
teacher:Is it okay with it around here,1
teacher:Its not okay right;student:No,1
teacher:Then well in your notebook okay,1
teacher:Are you done,1
teacher:You made it straight here,1
teacher:Chiba,1
teacher:Is it the same,1
teacher:Is it okay,1
teacher:There is Bandos land,1
teacher:But even if you didnt get the last one you got this one right,1
teacher:People who are done with group ones,1
teacher:You solved it,1
teacher:Group twos,1
teacher:Group threes,1
teacher:Group fours,1
teacher:Up to where did you get to,1
teacher:Group fives,1
teacher:Group sixs,1
teacher:Who got group fours;student:You can never do this one,1
teacher:Who said he or she got group fours,1
teacher:This topic okay,1
teacher:Thats right huh;student:Obtain the area of triangles which are in the places in the parallel lines,1
teacher:We studied this okay,1
teacher:It says since all of uhm these become the same height the areas become equal okay,1
teacher:Over here is Chibas land okay,1
teacher:Definitely,1
teacher:Is it the same,1
teacher:Wouldnt they fight over it if it was approximate,1
teacher:right;student:The more opposite side too,1
teacher:Thats right huh,1
teacher:Did you get it,1
teacher:You dont get it,1
teacher:Did you get it,1
teacher:Here right;student:There,1
teacher:You get one triangle right,1
teacher:You would draw it here right,1
teacher:Hm;student:Those two,1
teacher:You can make a lot right,1
teacher:You can make multiple numbers of it right,1
teacher:Is it just this one line,1
teacher:Thats right huh,1
teacher:You also need the side over there right,1
teacher:Thats right huh;student:Ah,1
teacher:And is it just here and here,1
teacher:There arent any complaints for that right;student:Oh,1
teacher:Thats right huh;student:Here also,1
teacher:The area that is the same with this triangle becomes like this and it also becomes like this okay,1
teacher:The middle of it;student:Its the parallel line of this and this,1
teacher:You were able to make this a triangle right,1
teacher:Would you get triangles with the same area,1
teacher:Would you make this the base,1
teacher:The question is that somewhere there are parallel lines okay,1
teacher:Cant you make a triangle somewhere,1
teacher:Do you understand;student:Thats right,1
teacher:Now then okay,1
teacher:well it seems the one over here is smaller right,1
teacher:If they are parallel then okay,1
teacher:It was quite a sharp thought okay,1
teacher:If its approximate of course it will become a fight right;student:I got it somewhat,1
teacher:Did you get it,1
teacher:If you do that you get a triangle right;student:Yes,1
teacher:You draw it here huh;student:You dont get a triangle,1
teacher:Hm well where is it the same area with this triangle,1
teacher:Its the same huh,1
teacher:Is this 180 yen,1
teacher:Anybody else having trouble finding the first and third quartile,1
teacher:Now we used the seventh and eighth to generate that median yeah,1
teacher:Let s hear Alan s;student:Now I ve got one for you,1
teacher:Are you going to let him get off that easily;student:Right,1
teacher:Yeah why not;student:Should we think of another problem and do it,1
teacher:Okay go ahead,1
teacher:Anyway do you know why youre here,1
teacher:Milin,1
teacher:You know the tower problem,1
teacher:Yeah the last one in class you did remember what that was  about;student:Yes I do,1
teacher:And do you remember what you did with  those towers of 5,1
teacher:Any 5 blocks;student:Different towers you could make from 5 blocks up,1
teacher:Okay and did you figure that out;student:It had to be 2 colors,1
teacher:You sure of it;student:32,1
teacher:Whats that;student:Well because there was a pattern,1
teacher:Okay but let me let me hear what Michelle has to say;student:Its always opposite though,1
teacher:Go go ahead Michelle,1
teacher:So it takes three of them;student:Like this,1
teacher:Do you know what shes talking about,1
teacher:Doing it in your head;student:I could do it,1
teacher:Are you experimenting,1
teacher:Who has another one,1
teacher:A hard  one,1
teacher:Do you have different ones or the same one,1
teacher:Okay why  don t you both come up,1
teacher:Whisper it to me Michael,1
teacher:If you know it raise your hand;student:I know it I know it,1
teacher:Okay Jacquelyn you tell us,1
teacher:How many think one tenth;student:One tenth,1
teacher:Jacquelyn,1
teacher:Ten times;student:Ten times,1
teacher:Is that true Sarah is that what you were gonna say,1
teacher:You have a real hard one Erik;student:I have a hard one,1
teacher:Lets hear from Meredith and then  well hear from you because Meredith gave me one before I said  no thatll take us probably a week,1
teacher:And ask your partner that problem;student:I made a problem,1
teacher:And make your partner convince you and then you switch  roles then your partner has to make up a problem and ask  you right;student:You don t know mine,1
teacher:You going to give it to Alan;student:I have a  problem,1
teacher:One way to do it so its 2;student:So you theres only  one way to do it so its 2,1
teacher:Let her finish,1
teacher:Do you understand what hes talking about;student:You  keep on doing that,1
teacher:Red on the bottom,1
teacher:Blue on top,1
teacher:Do you see that in your mind in the middle of  the table there,1
teacher:Can you see it,1
teacher:From from this one tower;student:See from this towers right,1
teacher:Is that what youre telling me to do,1
teacher:So from this  tower we get these two,1
teacher:Does that make any sense;student:Yeah and for each one you keep on doing that and for 6 you  get 64,1
teacher:Does that make sense what hes talking about;student:Okay I understand,1
teacher:Is yours different than the way Milin did it;student:And then I went redred red blueblueblue blueredblue redblueblue blueblue red redredblue redbluered blueredred,1
teacher:Let her finish,1
teacher:Lets hear what Stephanie does,1
teacher:Thats all there is of those,1
teacher:Lets hear how how Steph well hear well hear that other  way;student:Well thats not how I do it,1
teacher:Separated;student:Then   you want 2 blues stuck apart not stuck apart took apart,1
teacher:Can you see the first one,1
teacher:Can you all imagine that in  your mind,1
teacher:Now what I think Milin is asking us all to do is is to  imagine in front of us can you all see in front of you the  towers of 2 that are these colors;student:So you could do it anyway but see theyre just put together,1
teacher:Did you draw this Michelle or Milin,1
teacher:You all understand what hes talking about,1
teacher:Okay go ahead Stephanie;student:No but  thats not the pattern that  were working on,1
teacher:Go ahead  let let Milin persuade Jeff,1
teacher:These 4,1
teacher:Do you find what Milin is saying;student:Now you see it,1
teacher:Do you understand that;student:A red or a blue and the same thing with here,1
teacher:So do you see how  you get 8,1
teacher:Light green right;student:If if the blue was one whole what would the green be considered,1
teacher:So so youre saying that all of these are alternating and  these are opposite alternating;student:Now look you got red and blue,1
teacher:Is that right Michelle,1
teacher:Stephanie,1
teacher:Okay now if this is what he got for 4 and if you understood  what he just talked about can you write down these 4 and  use his idea to see if you could build 8;student:I understand that but,1
teacher:Does it matter,1
teacher:He had this right,1
teacher:Is that what you said,1
teacher:Do you all see that,1
teacher:Listen to Milin;student:But the thing is thats exactly,1
teacher:Okay so Milin wanted to stick that in earlier I thought and Michelle right;student:Blue,1
teacher:Ah because Mark has another one to ask  you go ahead Mark,1
teacher:Laura,1
teacher:How many think one third;student:One third,1
teacher:So are the number names always the same;student:One third,1
teacher:Are the color names always the same;student:No,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Does this have another name other than blue,1
teacher:Am I ever going to  call this something else other than blue,1
teacher:So are the number names same do they change,1
teacher:Do the number names change;student:Mmmhmm,1
teacher:Erik,1
teacher:Michael;student:Oh oh I know,1
teacher:There is a different number  name I gave for what I called one okay,1
teacher:So when the blue is one  can you see that the light green becomes a third,1
teacher:But can you see  when the dark green is one then you see that the red becomes a  third,1
teacher:So do we have permanent number names,1
teacher:Do the color names change,1
teacher:Nice and loud Beth;student:One third,1
teacher:How many think there are ten;student:Eight nine ten there we go I got them,1
teacher:Okay what a smart class are  you sure everyone didn t work with this last year,1
teacher:Discuss it with your partner;student:Cause two of these would make,1
teacher:How many think they could  be a third and a half,1
teacher:How many of you don t think it could be a  third and a sixth,1
teacher:Michael wanted to say something for a long time and has been very  patient;student:It  had to be one third and a half,1
teacher:I see Meredith is wanting to say something;student:Yeah Michael is right because it takes three sixths to equal one half  and if,1
teacher:I m sorry Meredith could you start again;student:I agree with Erik Michael and Brian because if you do call that a  sixth a sixth and if you put the dark green and two thirds you said  it was you said it was um they said that it s a third bigger if you  did a third bigger this is called a third and then you put it there you  see negative,1
teacher:Can you speak nice and loud Danielle,1
teacher:And;student:Put the two red ones next to the yellow one,1
teacher:So it doesnt work does it;student:And there s more space,1
teacher:And you can all  convince me,1
teacher:And you all did the same thing in convincing me  right you put the two red ones and it didnt come out to be a half  thats what you all did,1
teacher:Id better be  careful who I listen to right,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:Nice and loud David;student:Because if you put the two on top,1
teacher:Okay can you find dark  green,1
teacher:Are you ready for this one,1
teacher:Someone told me Jackie;student:Umm cause if you did it like this,1
teacher:Kelly your arrangement you want to say  something about your arrangement,1
teacher:Nice and loud Kelly,1
teacher:I know it looks sort of pink doesn t it;student:Purple,1
teacher:Jacquelyn,1
teacher:Now Im wondering some  of you looked at me sort of ahha I see what shes doing right,1
teacher:Are we changing the number names for the rods,1
teacher:I need to know what one is before  I can tell you the number names for the others isnt that true,1
teacher:Okay Laura,1
teacher:Okay do you understand the question;student:If one red rod was considered one fifth what would a whole be  considered,1
teacher:One more time ask the  question,1
teacher:Nice and loud Erik;student:Mmmhmm,1
teacher:You want to come up here Beth,1
teacher:Did you all hear the question;student:If the if the green was a whole what would a blue be,1
teacher:Nice and loud Erik;student:Three wholes,1
teacher:Can you imagine it,1
teacher:And try it on your seat;student:Transparent,1
teacher:Could you build  it on your desk and believe it,1
teacher:Do you all believe it,1
teacher:Nice and loud;student:Fourths,1
teacher:I can t Joanna  could you Danielle,1
teacher:Danielle,1
teacher:Ill give you another  one okay,1
teacher:Michael,1
teacher:Michael;student:Oh I can convince you that it s possible,1
teacher:Now Im asking you if I called the  dark green one and I called red one third could red now be one,1
teacher:Gregory is that a hand up or maybe you re thinking,1
teacher:Do  you understand my question,1
teacher:You want to talk about it with your partner for a minute,1
teacher:What Erik,1
teacher:You built it on your desk;student:I built it on my desk,1
teacher:Right;student:Because if this is a one,1
teacher:Okay are you ready to argue that Erik;student:Three wholes,1
teacher:Okay Alan,1
teacher:Nice and loud Alan;student:Three wholes,1
teacher:Are you all hearing what  Alan says,1
teacher:Ah you need to talk much louder;student:Okay because the the,1
teacher:Does that make any sense;student:So  the green would have to be three wholes,1
teacher:Do you understand what Erik is saying,1
teacher:Does that make sense Alan;student:Umm,1
teacher:You think it can be a third and a half;student:Well I think they might both be answers,1
teacher:Is that true Michelle;student:Because she was guessing not making patterns,1
teacher:You know the answer,1
teacher:Saurabh,1
teacher:Can you say that  tell me what she was saying about the the 2 and the 3,1
teacher:We have thoughts on this last one here;student:He or she got the method right and I hope the answer right,1
teacher:9 in all so youre saying theyre very close because they added the 1 and the 2 to get the 3 kind of like I think Ashank was helping us with over here;student:So 1 cream plus 2 chocolate equals 3 so 3 of them they they subtract then they come out its 9 then he just go on not,1
teacher:Daniel,1
teacher:Okay Ashank,1
teacher:Michelle;student:I think I got it but I m not sure but I think I   got it,1
teacher:Is that right;student:Yeah,1
teacher:You have a different number;student:I think it might work with three,1
teacher:True isn t it;student:That was three,1
teacher:I have to put three in all the boxes true,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Would you yeah write both of the  numbers would you,1
teacher:Isn t it,1
teacher:I need two   people to volunteer for something,1
teacher:Whats your name,1
teacher:Hum Stephanie would you come and hold this bag here;student:He got the whole class,1
teacher:Did anyone else hear her,1
teacher:And what  are you telling me thats the 3,1
teacher:Do you remember that one,1
teacher:Where you know what,1
teacher:Who would like to share,1
teacher:And  Samuel,1
teacher:These;student:The empty spaces or boxes,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Is that what I heard a few of you saying too the empty spaces,1
teacher:Somebody else,1
teacher:Thats little I can barely see   is it Osi,1
teacher:Whats your name Claire,1
teacher:Claire,1
teacher:In simplest form you mean related to this fraction;student:In simplest form,1
teacher:So are these equivalent fractions,1
teacher:And whats your Charlotte,1
teacher:123 columns;student:There are two empty columns and three columns together,1
teacher:Can somebody else tell me what she was thinking,1
teacher:Okay it turns out I may need three people,1
teacher:Milin can you try and stand somewhere and we are going   to ask you to put some of these glass things into that bag but don t do it yet and Milin maybe it s going to work   better if you stand on the end of the table there,1
teacher:Is   that sort of alright,1
teacher:Say it again,1
teacher:Can you show us a few in the  bag,1
teacher:Everyone hold up their  stones let s not take the stones out of the bag,1
teacher:Can I have one group leader read it out loud for us;student:Paul has 5 Legos,1
teacher:Brian  would you read it out loud for us,1
teacher:Are you counting them,1
teacher:Hold them up,1
teacher:Anyone in a  group of three;student:One two three four  five six,1
teacher:How are we doing in this group;student:One two three four five six,1
teacher:Could you read that first  problem for us again,1
teacher:Let s  count the fourteen for me,1
teacher:Can you show me five,1
teacher:You think it s nine;student:I got nine,1
teacher:Okay perhaps you can share that with  the children in your group,1
teacher:Okay do you have your fourteen,1
teacher:Is that alright,1
teacher:Okay you know all about that,1
teacher:Amy Lynn can you read it,1
teacher:Can somebody read the whole  thing,1
teacher:Amy Lynn would you would you   say go,1
teacher:You have to say it loudly;student:Go,1
teacher:Okay would you put seven in,1
teacher:This was a   seven because he counted in seven okay then but this is it is it true that there are seven pieces of glass in  that bag,1
teacher:That was twelve;student:How many is he taking out,1
teacher:Can I change it a little bit,1
teacher:Is it okay that we change it that  way,1
teacher:Did you want to respond,1
teacher:Is that  alright,1
teacher:Hum I need somebody else to say go,1
teacher:Volunteers to say go,1
teacher:Jeffery would you say go,1
teacher:Is it clear what that says;student:Say eighteen,1
teacher:Brian;student:Oh don t confuse me now,1
teacher:Is that alright;student:It s weird,1
teacher:Can somebody read that,1
teacher:Can I try that one more time,1
teacher:Does that work the same way;student:32,1
teacher:Okay so youre saying this 1 because they had the solution of 8 cups that they were only counting 1 cup of cream in the whole recipe;student:Then he wouldnt have had 2 cups of cream for 4 cups of chocolate,1
teacher:Im sorry youre saying that Can you say that again;student:If he thought that 1 cup only 1 cup of cream goes into the whole recipe,1
teacher:Will you come back;student:Yeah we did,1
teacher:Would you come back,1
teacher:Would you come back  another time,1
teacher:Can we come back another time,1
teacher:What what;student:Can I tell you what I told you last time I was here about  shirts and pants,1
teacher:Okay lets go ahead and move on to our next one   This was another problem on your assessment and it said it showed if you remember it showed you the picture told you this was a candy box and can I get a volunteer to read the problem to us,1
teacher:And you are  Alyssa,1
teacher:Alyssa will you read that for us,1
teacher:Im going to ask Alyssa will you speak so loudly that I can hear you way over here,1
teacher:And when you think youve figured it out can I get a private thumbsup when you think youre ready to move on,1
teacher:And you  are Ashank,1
teacher:She ate 3 right,1
teacher:Cynthia,1
teacher:A fraction way;student:I think that theres maybe kind of a fraction way,1
teacher:Mmm hmmm so 4 row okay  Oh thats   four items in a row;student:Like for in every row theres 4 columns I mean 4 rows,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:Is that what you mean,1
teacher:So you  multiplied it twice to build towers of 3 is that right,1
teacher:This is 22 once right,1
teacher:Are you sure,1
teacher:No no no lets hear what shes saying;student:She did it wrong,1
teacher:Lets hear her  thinking,1
teacher:So in other words could this have worked thats my  question;student:But you couldve just timesed this by 2 and you wouldve  had it a lot easier than going times times times,1
teacher:Or to 9,1
teacher:Do you understand the problem here,1
teacher:Now and I said Ill give you a calculator but you have  to know what to do with your calculator right,1
teacher:128;student:Towers of 7,1
teacher:Is that what you have Milin,1
teacher:But isnt that a nice challenging question;student:Get out,1
teacher:Fair enough,1
teacher:Lets hear Jeff,1
teacher:Can can we call time out for a minute;student:Actually you would multiply it by 1600,1
teacher:Does that make  sense,1
teacher:Do you understand,1
teacher:And then you multiplied it by 2 again right,1
teacher:For each row 1 of the 4 is given to Cindy;student:So then 1 is given to Cindy and 3 is given to Valerie so 1 4 is given to Cindy in each row,1
teacher:Jake;student:This first one is stopping confusing,1
teacher:This one;student:I think the second one is better because,1
teacher:Well I know but I didnt hear so can you say it again;student:Uh I was going to say what he said,1
teacher:Okay Deborah;student:Probably thought like since theres 2 and the problem said 2 cups of chocolate he probably thought every 2 cups theres like 9 cups or something and then thats how you got 2  9  the 18 cups but,1
teacher:9 cups is used for 1 ingredient;student:He thought that 9 cups is used for 1 ingredient,1
teacher:Did anybody want to speak to that,1
teacher:Timothy,1
teacher:He used the 9 in the wrong way;student:He used the 9 in the wrong way,1
teacher:So this here  would have been 3 cups;student:Yes which would have equaled 3,1
teacher:What did you want to say Saurabh,1
teacher:In this that Ashank was telling us about;student:But they he has to divide it by 3 because theres in the first row theres 3 uh,1
teacher:Multiply  this by 2;student:But since theres uh its asking uh how many how many cups of chocolate he used in the recipe they you have to multiply it by 2,1
teacher:So thats where you see the 6,1
teacher:What did you want to say,1
teacher:So youre saying this student should have stopped here,1
teacher:And that would have given them their 9 cups for total;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Did you have something to say,1
teacher:But that  what was the rest of that that you said;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Oh  okay maybe they didnt read all the information;student:I think that the person who answered this problem didnt read the whole problem,1
teacher:Bryan,1
teacher:Whats going on and  whats your name,1
teacher:Okay so its easier to see the 3 Valeries and the Cindy is that what you were saying;student:Because if youre looking its confusing 3 Valeries and then 1,1
teacher:Okay so you think this one is a little harder to interpret;student:But in the second its easy to calculate,1
teacher:You dont see that in this one,1
teacher:You think this ones easier to see,1
teacher:Kevin could you read this for us,1
teacher:Nice and loud;student:Anthony makes candy,1
teacher:Ingredients;student:In all he uses 9 cups of the two ingrdients,1
teacher:You said it would go 1 and 4,1
teacher:Do you remember that one;student:How many cups of chocolate does he use in his candy recipe,1
teacher:Andrew,1
teacher:Osi what did you want to say,1
teacher:So how many of you thought that there was maybe a misunderstanding of the problem,1
teacher:Does that ever happen to you,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Maybe sometimes,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Can you count  them for us,1
teacher:Do  you believe that Brian,1
teacher:Isn t that what you said,1
teacher:So can you try to find some so that you can try to convince them that  it should work for other models and come up with a way of  explaining it to the class ok;student:Mmm hmm yeah,1
teacher:Ok I see you had your hands up  over here;student:Go get another box,1
teacher:Here which one do you want to tell me about,1
teacher:The orange and red together;student:Now if you call this rod one,1
teacher:Can we go back to that one again;student:And  in this one it you take this,1
teacher:You said two of those little white ones were two twelfths right;student:Um yeah well maybe,1
teacher:one of the whites you say is one sixth,1
teacher:Why don t you work with your partner and see if you can  figure it out,1
teacher:A bunch,1
teacher:Takes a lot doesn t it,1
teacher:Ok so does that mean we have a different answer;student:It was bigger by one one sixth,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:And so you think that you get a different answer if you  have different models,1
teacher:As to how much bigger,1
teacher:You re still looking for another way to do it;student:Well,1
teacher:You called  this one,1
teacher:That  doesn t quite work does it,1
teacher:Six ones,1
teacher:Yes David and Meredith;student:I think one half is,1
teacher:Or if we had sort of a medium size model like Marks and he were  trying to make these fit would you expect the fish to be smaller than  the people than the boat;student:Yeah,1
teacher:So in each of your models would have those relationships holding  right;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Is that like what youre doing when you make models to  compare fractions,1
teacher:Meredith,1
teacher:Can someone help,1
teacher:Let s  talk about this a little bit more to help them,1
teacher:Who wants to give it a  try,1
teacher:Or the people who arent sure want to  tell us what they are confused about,1
teacher:Do you want to talk a little bit,1
teacher:Audra,1
teacher:Jackie,1
teacher:What bothers you and then maybe the people here  will try to help ok,1
teacher:Does that help Laura Audra or would you like to ask Michael a  question;student:You could still do that in Audras model or  any box,1
teacher:Meredith you were going to say  something earlier,1
teacher:Oh it was said already,1
teacher:Tell me again,1
teacher:We found one way over here we found  this way it seems to me  there ought to be something in between is  that what you re thinking,1
teacher:You said here that if you have two thirds and a half oh there  you said over here now you have to see if you can do it  with thirds is that right,1
teacher:The two thirds are always bigger than the half;student:Cause they re the  same because the thirds are always bigger than the half,1
teacher:How many of you got one sixth,1
teacher:How many of you used a red rod to represent one sixth in that model  and you showed it was bigger by one sixth;student:Red,1
teacher:And some other people told me a white would be one  twelfth,1
teacher:Is that true,1
teacher:So so what is Meredith saying here,1
teacher:Are there two answers;student:Theres two answers,1
teacher:Youre saying that youre calling the red  youre giving red the number name right,1
teacher:The length of the red  right,1
teacher:Well give it the number name what did you say,1
teacher:And two whites can I write two  w   for  two whites,1
teacher:So were talking about the length of the red rod the  length of the red rod is the same as the length of the two white rods;student:A red one red equals one red rod up here one red equals two  of the white ones,1
teacher:Is that  true,1
teacher:And youre saying if you have if you take one half thats all right;student:And its one sixth its one sixth,1
teacher:Is that what you are saying,1
teacher:All those things are they true;student:Yeah,1
teacher:And you got two thirds to be bigger  than one half,1
teacher:Did you get dark green to be a half;student:Uh dark green,1
teacher:Did you get two thirds to be two purples,1
teacher:You didn t  Michael,1
teacher:It s the only way you could  show it there isn t it,1
teacher:Mmm over each of  em;student:And then  that would be one sixth too,1
teacher:So I m going to ask you some  some important questions are you all listening to my questions,1
teacher:How many of you made one  model and absolutely are convinced that you know by your model  which is bigger one half or two thirds,1
teacher:How many of you did that  with one model and you are absolutely convinced with your model  you know which is bigger one half or two thirds,1
teacher:Would you please  raise your hand if you made one model you could have made more  than one but you made at least one,1
teacher:If you made at least one model  girls and you re absolutely convinced No  one could persuade you otherwise that you know which is bigger  one half or two thirds,1
teacher:Yeah is that right;student:Yes,1
teacher:Again;student:Two thirds,1
teacher:How many of you made a second  model,1
teacher:Are you all  watching,1
teacher:Meredith,1
teacher:Did you think that,1
teacher:Amy,1
teacher:How many of you called  one  orange and red in that model;student:Ah the orange and red,1
teacher:Did you get to have two thirds bigger than a  half,1
teacher:How many of you believe one sixth;student:One sixth,1
teacher:Well youre saying if you took a twelfth a rod that has length one  twelfth and another rod that has length one twelfth and put them  together right;student:Theyre just two answers,1
teacher:But should those relationships hold;student:Youd have bigger people bigger boat and a bigger fish,1
teacher:Suppose in your little stage  you showed the people and the boat and the fish right,1
teacher:Whats your name,1
teacher:Joey;student:Joey,1
teacher:Tell your partner really quickly what is it Julian,1
teacher:Um is it Jessica,1
teacher:Stacey,1
teacher:He outlined the circle which is the perimeter;student:He outlined the circle with the perimeter,1
teacher:How about Shira,1
teacher:Shira,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Desiree,1
teacher:Erica,1
teacher:Brandon,1
teacher:I was thinking about this model because we were talking about  models the other day werent we,1
teacher:Remember that,1
teacher:Erik,1
teacher:Yamlen,1
teacher:Do you remember,1
teacher:Are you Brandon,1
teacher:Can you guys see what Alex is doing,1
teacher:Do you all remember it,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Is it Cassie,1
teacher:Okay so the circumference of areas I mean the area and perimeters of rectangles and then you had circumference and you were looking at pizzas;student:We were looking at the circumference and area of the circle and the difference,1
teacher:Do you guys remember that problem,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Okay did everyone have a chance to talk about it,1
teacher:Yeah,1
teacher:Um is it Connie,1
teacher:Angelique,1
teacher:The rectangle;student:I mean  I mean the rectangle,1
teacher:How  bout  is it Alex,1
teacher:Alexander,1
teacher:Okay so the area is whats inside and the perimeter is whats outside;student:Well the area is whats inside and the perimeter is whats outside,1
teacher:Alex do you want to come up and color in one of those for me,1
teacher:how about is Brandon,1
teacher:Erik;student:Oh,1
teacher:Yeah can you get different answers right Michael and Erik;student:if you use different models,1
teacher:if you  use different models,1
teacher:Would it be okay to put Audras fish  in Danielles box,1
teacher:Graham,1
teacher:Maybe it would but it might not right,1
teacher:Ok it raises some interesting questions doesnt it;student:but you cant put Audras fish into Danielles box because its too small,1
teacher:But do you get the idea,1
teacher:That once youve built your model  and you decide what you are going to call one right,1
teacher:Youve chosen  to make your other principal players in relationship to that one  right,1
teacher:So in this case if if your one is going to be the size of this  little stage if you like  your players are made the boy the  girl the fish the boat in relationship to this stage isnt it,1
teacher:But if youve made your one a much bigger stage if you  like your  players are going to be in relationship to that stage isnt that right;student:Mm hmm,1
teacher:And as long as you stay within your stage right you show your  relationships and if they may or may not work when you switch  stages right,1
teacher:And that s like switching candy bars right,1
teacher:Isnt that  right,1
teacher:Would you expect if  you were building a brand new model that what you showed to be  true with your first model should it still work,1
teacher:Should it still work  with the new model the relationships you showed with your old  model,1
teacher:Would you expect it to work if your,1
teacher:And lets  suppose that Audra made a big model right,1
teacher:And Danielle decided to make a very little model okay a little  tiny model,1
teacher:But  suppose Mark had his model and suppose Danielle made a model  ok,1
teacher:Would the relationships that youre suppose to show change,1
teacher:How many of you thought  you shouldn t get different answers,1
teacher:How  many of you are not sure,1
teacher:Have you been thinking about that at all since then,1
teacher:Maybe not huh Michael have you been thinking about that a little  bit,1
teacher:But I  looked at the sea monster okay and I looked at the boat okay and I  was thinking about their sizes a little bit right,1
teacher:What are you why  are you smiling about Mark,1
teacher:Did you want the sea monster to be bigger than the boat;student:I made the sea monster  bigger than the boat,1
teacher:Would you expect lets say in Audras model which is a different  model that her fish was smaller than the people and smaller than the  boat;student:Yeah mmm hmm,1
teacher:Did you want that,1
teacher:Lets not make  it a sea monster and lets change it a little bit theyre fishing and then  their boat is docked somewhere do you understand,1
teacher:Mark,1
teacher:Meredith,1
teacher:But one thing that would be  the same is the relative one thing you have to be careful each of you  in your own models would be the sizes in relation to the other sizes  right,1
teacher:And if somebody came in now with a fish bigger than the boy   that would have missed the point right,1
teacher:Would you  expect one model to come up with something different than the  other,1
teacher:Would it look different,1
teacher:And I said to all of you I want you to go and  make me a model of two children right and theyre sitting at a dock  and theyre fishing and they just caught a fish right,1
teacher:Right and you said it s bigger by the red right;student:This is one whole and then this is one third and this is one half,1
teacher:Isnt that  what you said,1
teacher:So are all of these true  statements,1
teacher:Nobody wants to try,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Danielle do you want to go up there and,1
teacher:Three sixths;student:It s I have three I think three sixths,1
teacher:Do you follow  that,1
teacher:And so you are saying that if you got three of  those right,1
teacher:You re  saying that you think that three sixths is another name for one half,1
teacher:So what do we have here,1
teacher:Do you believe that,1
teacher:Six twelfths,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Nice and loud;student:We did two fourths,1
teacher:Jessica,1
teacher:Are these all the ones we had,1
teacher:Danielle,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Remember that,1
teacher:You don t see that it s two fourths,1
teacher:Mark,1
teacher:We said we were giving her half the  candy bar didn t we,1
teacher:Do you understand my question,1
teacher:If this is my candy bar  and I gave her that much right,1
teacher:One number name we said was one  half didn t we,1
teacher:Ok so discuss it,1
teacher:Ok Jackie,1
teacher:Jackie I am sorry I cant hear its so loud here;student:Um well we thought it was six twelfths because,1
teacher:Did you all hear uh what Jackie said,1
teacher:How  many of your heard what Jackie said,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you heard  what she said,1
teacher:That another number name  you said Jackie was,1
teacher:Danielle,1
teacher:You thought two fourths;student:Um I thought um it would be um two fourths,1
teacher:Two  fourths,1
teacher:Because there are four rows and we if talk about the first two rows  that s two fourths;student:Because there s four rows,1
teacher:Is it that you don t see that it s two  fourths,1
teacher:Do you remember,1
teacher:Any others,1
teacher:Michael,1
teacher:Is that what you built when you went up there you said the dark  green is one;student:The dark green,1
teacher:Is that what you said,1
teacher:Did you change your mind,1
teacher:Did you say that;student:Yeah,1
teacher:You hear  my question,1
teacher:Is everybody hearing my question,1
teacher:Is that what you meant to say;student:I think you meant to say not one whole but one sixth,1
teacher:So you re saying then you all agree that s what you all really  wanted to call the little white one one sixth and not one;student:Yeah,1
teacher:When you  call the light green one,1
teacher:So I m a little concerned now,1
teacher:You re sure it s one sixth;student:One sixth,1
teacher:Why can t it one;student:Yea,1
teacher:The dark green is one;student:Because that s be um the dark green,1
teacher:But can you do that in the same problem;student:You could call you can call the dark green one six the  dark green rod six and then you could call the light green rod three,1
teacher:I still want to go back to the problem Brian was helping them with  the problem up there I still wonder if we can solve this one because  you started with this other one and you said that the orange and red   are one right,1
teacher:Are you making different size  candy bars,1
teacher:Is that allowed;student:Oh I think they re making a different size candy bar,1
teacher:So you re giving a red the number name one sixth and I understand  the young ladies up at the overhead are giving red the number name  one third and can red have the number name one third and one sixth  at the same time;student:Well I mean a red I m considering a red one sixth   because two of these  equals see they re two they re two  sixths two halves of one purple and the purple is a third and the half  of one third is sixth there s sixths,1
teacher:And you re saying one half  is bigger than one third by one third,1
teacher:Two tenths is that right;student:Two tenths,1
teacher:You were working on a  problem I think in class together I think you were in groups weren t  you,1
teacher:Michael,1
teacher:Andrew,1
teacher:How many of you worked out which is bigger;student:Yeah we were working on we had to write about um and we had to  do an example on it and um to see if which is bigger one half or one  third,1
teacher:How many of you think they are the  same,1
teacher:How many of you think one is bigger,1
teacher:Remember that,1
teacher:Laura,1
teacher:How many  of you think you know how much bigger it is,1
teacher:Teacher You re calling the orange and red rod one;student:Um one,1
teacher:Can you say that again  what number names gave to each of those rods so I can hear from  back here,1
teacher:Want to speak to the class;student:I agree because,1
teacher:Kelly,1
teacher:You re calling this one right,1
teacher:And you re calling this one half,1
teacher:Do you  think one half is bigger,1
teacher:Is that what you said  when you talk about the lengths of the rods,1
teacher:Remember how appreciative  she was,1
teacher:Do you remember that,1
teacher:How many people did that one,1
teacher:Does this table make mathematical sense,1
teacher:Okay you can take a moment now and talk to your shoulder partner,1
teacher:Does it make mathematical sense,1
teacher:Lets start with Kyle,1
teacher:Does this make mathematical sense,1
teacher:Um Debra,1
teacher:Melanie you had a comment about the previous question,1
teacher:Or about 0,1
teacher:Okay do you want to talk about 0 then;student:About the 0,1
teacher:Okay so if we rented 0 movies from Online Flix youre saying we would still have to pay the 12;student:I think that it does make sense because the 12 the Online Flix you have to pay 12 per month and so that would be you would havent rent no movies but you still have to pay for the month on each one,1
teacher:Okay even though I dont have anything;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Jocelyn,1
teacher:Uh huh;student:Um it doesnt really make sense because like Movie Busters see how all the way down it adds 3,1
teacher:Hailey,1
teacher:So are you saying that your group took s group number 5 situation and put it with A;student:I think that the situation you gave fits more to histogram A because um histogram A shows no people getting scores of 70 to 80 or higher and so that means that everybody got a very low sco or a low score whereas in um histogram F a few people got a score that was 70 to 80 80 to 90 90 to 100,1
teacher:Danielle,1
teacher:Everything;student:Everything,1
teacher:Fabulous can you read for us please,1
teacher:Thats something for us to think about ok,1
teacher:So  Meredith is still saying that I dont disagree with you when I say  that its a red bigger in this model  right,1
teacher:Or if Im thinking about the white rods right,1
teacher:Does that contradict what youre doing,1
teacher:Or does it still  work what youre doing,1
teacher:Thats  something to think about isnt it,1
teacher:would you read it,1
teacher:Um how many groups matched um histogram F with 5,1
teacher:Can I see,1
teacher:How many groups did that match,1
teacher:Histogram F,1
teacher:Did anyone feel good about F,1
teacher:whos the recorderreporter,1
teacher:come on up,1
teacher:Can you,1
teacher:Could do;student:Some people got low scores but most people but some people could do everything,1
teacher:So the two flat fees of 12 plus the 1 makes the 25,1
teacher:Jessica,1
teacher:Amir;student:I think it does make mathematical sense because they all match the plan,1
teacher:Is one fifth equal to two tenths,1
teacher:Can you say that so the class hears you and see what they think;student:This is usually a tenth   and then you put this  up and you call this two tenth  and then you take this and you put it  up to them   and it s  five they equal up to it,1
teacher:I  am not did you all hear what Meredith said,1
teacher:Why don t you tell the class and;student:two ones     That is what two tenths  would be  because these ones are tenths,1
teacher:So what is your conclusion if I ask you the question is two tenths  equal to one fifth;student:And if you take one of them  it s equal to two tenths,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:What do you think;student:It s the same  as being two tenths equal one fifth,1
teacher:Ok anybody else;student:Like what I said kind of,1
teacher:Any other discussion,1
teacher:Any other discussion,1
teacher:How many of you believe that one tenth two  tenths and one fifth represent the same length,1
teacher:Do you think it would  be okay to give them the same number name,1
teacher:How many of you  think it would be ok,1
teacher:Makes sense doesn t it,1
teacher:Do you remember the candy bar,1
teacher:Do you remember talking about any of those ideas at all,1
teacher:Is one fifth equal to two tenths,1
teacher:Task 1 is 15  210,1
teacher:What does  that say Michael,1
teacher:Lisa,1
teacher:Go ahead and talk to your shoulder partner please for a quick moment,1
teacher:So if 0 is important Id like you to tell me with thumbsup under your chin if 0 is not important show me with thumbsdown;student:Oh si,1
teacher:Katie,1
teacher:Could I have someone restate what Katie just shared,1
teacher:Hailey,1
teacher:Jessica,1
teacher:Remember I was giving half of this  little candy bar to Dr Martino,1
teacher:Kyle,1
teacher:If yes thumbsup if no thumbsdown,1
teacher:Erin,1
teacher:Charles,1
teacher:So Jessica are you gonna make any changes to Student As work,1
teacher:So do you need to make some changes;student:Uh 16 I mean 15 dollars,1
teacher:Do you remember that,1
teacher:Can you read that statement,1
teacher:Would we be able to answer the question um of when the three plans would cost the same,1
teacher:But we havent used a piece of data one of our pieces of data as the median have we,1
teacher:Count again out loud;student:Eight,1
teacher:Did you  tell me how to solve it;student:Yes,1
teacher:So Meredith is still saying that I dont disagree with  you when I say that its a red bigger in this model  right,1
teacher:Or if Im thinking  about the white rods right,1
teacher:Thats something to think  about isnt it,1
teacher:We have a whole lot of new ideas  don t we,1
teacher:Write a statement about each of those  models that makes it a different model okay,1
teacher:Is that a good  question Meredith,1
teacher:If youre not sure you can talk to  your partner,1
teacher:Let me call on uh Mark,1
teacher:Andrew would you like to come also,1
teacher:Jessica,1
teacher:Audra go ahead,1
teacher:Would I be using five whites to get  the same length as the orange,1
teacher:So you are saying I have what looks  like the same if I take two whites and think  about them together its like a red,1
teacher:Ok and  thats what you are saying,1
teacher:I thought thats  what you are saying,1
teacher:Thats something for us to think about  ok,1
teacher:Meredith you have your hand up,1
teacher:Is that  what you said when you talk about the lengths of the rods,1
teacher:Well youre saying if you took a twelfth a rod that has  length one twelfth and another rod that has length one  twelfth and put them together right;student:Theyre just two answers,1
teacher:Did you get two thirds to be two  purples,1
teacher:Did you get dark green to be a  half;student:Uh dark green,1
teacher:And you got two thirds to  be bigger than one half,1
teacher:How many of you got one sixth,1
teacher:How many of you used a red rod to represent one sixth in  that model and you showed it was bigger by one sixth;student:Red,1
teacher:Ok but she didnt combine them and shes calling the two  whites together again Meredith;student:But you have to combine them,1
teacher:And some other  people told me a white would be one twelfth,1
teacher:Youre saying that  youre calling the red youre giving red the number name  right,1
teacher:The length of the red right,1
teacher:Well give it the number  name what did you say,1
teacher:And two whites can I write two  w    for two whites,1
teacher:So were talking about the length of the red rod  the length of the red rod is the same as the length of the two  white rods;student:A red one red equals one red rod up here one red  equals two of the white ones,1
teacher:Is that true,1
teacher:And youre saying if you have if you take one half thats all  right;student:And its one sixth its one sixth,1
teacher:Is that what you are saying,1
teacher:Isnt that what you said,1
teacher:Meredith you want to come up,1
teacher:Sarah and Beth do you want to come up,1
teacher:Beth do you want to come up,1
teacher:Michael,1
teacher:Beth,1
teacher:Did anyone think about it like  that in terms of money,1
teacher:Okay I want to hear now take a little time  think about it and talk to your partners;student:Five ten fifteen twenty     Oh,1
teacher:You just thought of it;student:I did,1
teacher:And five just popped into your head as being  the right one;student:And  then for twos  two four six eight ten and it  would go on and be more than ten,1
teacher:You think five works;student:I think that its five too,1
teacher:Do you fell that is pretty convincing;student:Ha ha  we know out multiplication  tables,1
teacher:Do you  really feel you could convince people that we  would be calling the white rod the number  name  five,1
teacher:And it worked;student:So then we just thought five,1
teacher:Well do you want to try;student:I got the answer but I dont know how to say  it  explain it really,1
teacher:Does that have something to do with it;student:I think well five times  ten equals fifty so,1
teacher:One fiftieth;student:Yeah one fiftieth,1
teacher:It just seems like a good name to call it  because youre calling this fifty,1
teacher:Is that what youre thinking;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Okay  lets see here is there anybody here I havent  had a chance to hear from,1
teacher:I would love to hear from somebody that  I have not had a chance to hear from,1
teacher:Did you hear that;student:It takes ten ones to make up an orange,1
teacher:Can you say it again please,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Because you can see two there is that what  youre saying;student:Well even that even that two white cubes  equal up to one red cube its still not its still  not like um like um imagining that this was  another red cube so I think it really is two  tenths because it really really is two tenths,1
teacher:Do you think its possible that those could  both be could each of these be a number  name for the two whites if I am calling the  orange a  one;student:Yeah yeah it it also is one it also is one fifth  but what you are seeing right here really is  two tenths not a fifth,1
teacher:Is it possible that those could both be  number names that would work,1
teacher:Not too  sure,1
teacher:Brian is saying he can  see how it could be one fifth if we changed it  to a red if we took the two whites and  changed it to red but when he looks at the  two whites he thinks of two tenths right,1
teacher:If you think you  know please raise your hand,1
teacher:Did you all do that;student:Um two thirds is two purples,1
teacher:It gets to be a really tough when I change the  number name doesnt it;student:Beth  This is a ten and ten of these equal to one,1
teacher:So do  you feel that by showing me this youve  proven that,1
teacher:Would it be called ten,1
teacher:That sounds like a good name for it doesnt it;student:Oh then this would be  one  I guess,1
teacher:So thats the number you would give it then;student:And and this one  just  that would be one,1
teacher:Is there anybody who would like to  tell me what they think about this,1
teacher:Jackie;student:Call on my girlfriend here,1
teacher:Did you hear what  Jackie said,1
teacher:So youd give it a number name of one;student:This is only one because if you call the orange a  ten and the ones equal to a ten when you call  this  a one then theyre going to  change to a one,1
teacher:Fifty of these here;student:Um Fifty,1
teacher:You didn t Michael,1
teacher:Amy,1
teacher:Meredith,1
teacher:Who wants to give it a try,1
teacher:Or the people who arent sure want to tell us  what they are confused about,1
teacher:Do you want to talk a little bit,1
teacher:Audra,1
teacher:Jackie,1
teacher:What bothers you and then maybe the people  here will try to help ok,1
teacher:Do you know what the question is,1
teacher:Do you want to say that one more time;student:Um is the mod is different models bigger than others and  um,1
teacher:Is that the question;student:You can use different models that are theyre the same,1
teacher:What do you think Audra is that your  question,1
teacher:You think it s a different question,1
teacher:Who else is confused what you think the problem is;student:Um you  were asking um if we thought what sizes can fit into each  box what sizes should be that we are going to get confused  that the fish can fit into a box,1
teacher:Laura,1
teacher:Are you in this category of not being sure,1
teacher:Is that like what youre doing when you make models  to compare fractions,1
teacher:Whos going to try with the  question,1
teacher:So in each of your models would have those relationships  holding right;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Yeah is that right;student:Yes,1
teacher:Ok it raises some interesting questions doesnt it;student:but you cant put Audras fish into Danielles box because its too small,1
teacher:But do you get the idea,1
teacher:That once  youve built your model and you decide what you are going  to call one right,1
teacher:Youve chosen to make your other  principal players in relationship to that one right,1
teacher:So in this  case if if your one is going to be the size of this little stage if  you like  your players are made the boy  the girl the fish the boat in relationship to this stage isnt it,1
teacher:But if youve made your one a much bigger stage if you  like your players are going to be in relationship to that stage  isnt that right;student:Mm hmm,1
teacher:And as long as you stay within your stage  right you show your relationships and if they may or may  not work when you switch stages right,1
teacher:And that s like  switching candy bars right,1
teacher:Isnt that right,1
teacher:Would you  expect if you were building a brand new model that what you  showed to be true with your first model should it still work,1
teacher:Should it still work with the new model the relationships you  showed with your old model,1
teacher:Would you expect it to work if  your,1
teacher:Suppose in your little  stage you showed the people and the boat and the fish right,1
teacher:Would you expect lets say in Audras model which is a  different model that her fish was smaller than the people and  smaller than the boat;student:Yeah mmm hmm,1
teacher:But should those relationships hold;student:Youd have bigger people bigger boat and a bigger fish,1
teacher:Or if we had sort of a medium size model like Marks and he  were trying to make these fit would you expect the fish to be  smaller than the people than the boat;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Go ahead Erik give it a try  because we also have some people coming in,1
teacher:Jackie;student:And how does that how do those models help us understand the models were building,1
teacher:Does that help Laura Audra or would you like to ask  Michael a question;student:You  could still do that in Audras model or any box,1
teacher:Is there any other way that you could show that  difference here than with the whites,1
teacher:It s the only way you  could show it there isn t it,1
teacher:Mmm over each of  em;student:And  then that would be one sixth too,1
teacher:So  I m going to ask you some some important questions are  you all listening to my questions,1
teacher:How many of you made one model and absolutely  are convinced that you know by your model which is bigger  one half or two thirds,1
teacher:How many of you did that with one  model and you are absolutely convince with your model you  know which is bigger one half or two thirds,1
teacher:Would you  please raise your hand if you made one model you could  have made more than one but you made at least one,1
teacher:If you  made at least one model girls and you re absolutely  convinced No one could persuade  you otherwise that you know which is bigger one half or two  thirds,1
teacher:Again;student:Two thirds,1
teacher:How many of you believe one sixth;student:One sixth,1
teacher:How  many of you made a second model,1
teacher:Are you watching,1
teacher:Meredith,1
teacher:You think you showed  something else in your second model,1
teacher:Did you think that,1
teacher:The two thirds are always bigger than the half;student:Cause  they re the same because the thirds are always bigger than  the half,1
teacher:You said here that if you have two thirds and a half oh  there you said over here now you have to see if  you can do it with thirds is that right,1
teacher:This is there  something smaller than this brown that would work attached  to this,1
teacher:Hmm she used the orange and the brown is there something  smaller than the brown that you could put together that would  work no add onto the orange,1
teacher:Meredith you were going to say something earlier,1
teacher:Oh it was said already,1
teacher:Gentlemen;student:There we  go,1
teacher:Ok is it possible to make another example Alan;student:I have it right here,1
teacher:Would it still work;student:Yeah I guess,1
teacher:You re sure it would work;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Can you figure that,1
teacher:Did you get to have two thirds  bigger than a half,1
teacher:A  bunch,1
teacher:Ok so does that mean we have a different answer;student:It was bigger by one one sixth,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:And so you think that you get a different answer  if you have different models,1
teacher:As to how much bigger,1
teacher:I  agree with you you re saying that two thirds is still bigger  but it it bigger by a different thing,1
teacher:You re still looking for another way to do it;student:Well,1
teacher:We found one way over here we found this way it seems to  me  there ought to be something in between is that what  you re thinking,1
teacher:Takes a lot doesn t it,1
teacher:Maybe it would but it might not right,1
teacher:Is this a good time for me to ask  people what they came up with or are there  still a lot of people working here,1
teacher:Beth you come up with her,1
teacher:So you just did three sides;student:A six centimeter line and then I just used compass points and joined them,1
teacher:Yeah well thats that determines the length of a line doesnt it;student:No the length of this like how much apart,1
teacher:So you found the length of that;student:And join that and then join these together and found the measurements of the,1
teacher:First of all you started with a line didnt you;student:Yeah,1
teacher:In between the two lines in the middle all right,1
teacher:Helen,1
teacher:Yes Kate,1
teacher:A side and two angles all right,1
teacher:So youve got the length of that side and the length of that side is that the same as anything Ive done,1
teacher:And where it says for number one it says are these triangles congruent,1
teacher:Can you see that,1
teacher:Elise,1
teacher:Kate,1
teacher:Mikala,1
teacher:So you know you understand what were doing today,1
teacher:Is everyone nearly finished,1
teacher:Even though you missed the lesson;student:No,1
teacher:Havent you,1
teacher:And that was a length so it determined a a point didnt it;student:Yep,1
teacher:Interesting but are they congruent;student:Uhh no because,1
teacher:Pardon;student:Because I wasnt here on Tuesday,1
teacher:So have you done two,1
teacher:Pardon;student:Miss what should we do now,1
teacher:Have you done all of them have you;student:What should we do now,1
teacher:So if its saying horizontal its saying its at an angle arent you;student:Interval A C is horizontal,1
teacher:Then youre defining the angle between them arent you;student:Yeah and you um,1
teacher:Right so did they need all those instructions to finish your triangle;student:Because interval interval A B C is a right angle,1
teacher:Pardon;student:Um number two I then made 90 degrees set square,1
teacher:And so you drew a right angle as well,1
teacher:Did you draw all sides;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Yours were all lines as well;student:Uh,1
teacher:Are you finished,1
teacher:When you cut them out you usually cut them out to see if they fit;student:Um with Louises we did,1
teacher:So you ended up with an angle there didnt you,1
teacher:So really youve drawn that triangle first havent you,1
teacher:Got a few right;student:Um,1
teacher:Yeah;student:No I wasnt here and I didnt know about it,1
teacher:Okay dont forget if youve got that situation where something is all cubed both the numerical coefficient as well as the variable has to be cubed yeah;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Youre finding multiplying by one and two difficult,1
teacher:Anyone not completed the cumulative frequency column,1
teacher:Josh,1
teacher:Finished Josh,1
teacher:Is there anyone else having difficulty with the median,1
teacher:Do you understand that girls,1
teacher:To two decimal places 35 was it;student:which is approximately thirty point five seven,1
teacher:Sorry,1
teacher:Who had thirty point five seven as the mean,1
teacher:Anyone not,1
teacher:Who had twentyeight point five as the median;student:Twentyeight point five,1
teacher:Who had all three points correct,1
teacher:Well remember the lower quartile is going to be the midpoint of that lower range yeah,1
teacher:So have we used one of those pieces of data to obtain this median,1
teacher:Fourteen right;student:Fourteen,1
teacher:Anyone not completed the F X column,1
teacher:Whats the problem,1
teacher:Whats up Jacques,1
teacher:Who had one three one one one one one one two one and one,1
teacher:Okay any questions about them,1
teacher:Which you have on that sheet that Ive given you so that I can be pretty sure that each cookie is going to end up with at least three yes,1
teacher:What about if I had 18 now theyre mixed up in this mixture for the six cookies are you sure that each time you scoop out some of that mixture youre gonna get three,1
teacher:So you youre riding on the bare minimum there arent you,1
teacher:Do you understand,1
teacher:So you know what to do,1
teacher:Can you continue,1
teacher:So did it work;student:Interval A C is horizontal and it measures three centimeters,1
teacher:Do you understand what youre doing,1
teacher:Whos finished,1
teacher:Any group not,1
teacher:Mitch have you finished,1
teacher:Daniel;student:Twentytwo,1
teacher:And Tam;student:Twentysix,1
teacher:What I want you to do now there are all the results okay,1
teacher:Is there anyone who hasnt completed the frequency column,1
teacher:Whos finished;student:Do we roll it we roll until each  three,1
teacher:Ok lets see  um Sarah,1
teacher:I think you can see theyre pretty right cant you;student:Yeah interval A B is vertical and measures five centimeters,1
teacher:Has Jessica finished,1
teacher:Who would like to share;student:Well she didnt have enough,1
teacher:Do you think you  could remember them because we are probably going to have to  turn in an assignment,1
teacher:I am confused I  thought you were calling this one,1
teacher:There is a difference of two sixths between a half and a third;student:A difference of two sixths,1
teacher:This difference between a red and a  because she told me if I  put two of them here it should balance,1
teacher:Is that what you are  telling me Meredith,1
teacher:Try to remember this for tomorrow when  we will be writing about this okay,1
teacher:Spares,1
teacher:Just do this with a brief discussion with the person next to you please,1
teacher:The actual heading says Polygon doesnt it,1
teacher:Who who had exterior angle uh picked out as something that they need to know about,1
teacher:So would that be a polygon,1
teacher:Who has found the spot that actually tells you on the page what an exterior angle is,1
teacher:Peter,1
teacher:What does the first sentence underneath the heading say,1
teacher:Ok I want to hear about this;student:Well we got two answers,1
teacher:Emma,1
teacher:Ok but is this the whole thing;student:If this was the whole think like one then this could be three fourths,1
teacher:So a half is this much bigger,1
teacher:Is there anything else you want to say about  that;student:And then um,1
teacher:Or does that basically say it,1
teacher:What do  you think,1
teacher:It looks like youre using the light greens and reds David,1
teacher:Ok do you want me to let you get your balance together and  then Ill come back;student:Well I made a balance to see which was bigger,1
teacher:It is one half of one third;student:It is one half of one third,1
teacher:Can I ask you something then can we do the same thing for the  white rods;student:And then and then it might not  work unless there is something of three that first on the dark  green and that would be the red cause you can fit three,1
teacher:To find out what the number name might be,1
teacher:Would that work,1
teacher:Go ahead Sarah,1
teacher:Sure right;student:It is six and it makes up to the green block,1
teacher:And we are calling this one right,1
teacher:Did you want to try it,1
teacher:Because of the double support;student:I am not sure if it will because of these two pieces,1
teacher:Can I ask you another question;student:A half,1
teacher:You see that,1
teacher:Ive turned it into a ray now havent I,1
teacher:And it does lie outside the original polygon does it,1
teacher:Itll look like that wont it,1
teacher:Will we get the computer to do that for us,1
teacher:You need to do a little can I just do this,1
teacher:Because if you have more sides you might get a higher total might mightn you;student:Okay,1
teacher:But just before you go who found that their conjecture or prediction was confirmed by what they did,1
teacher:Do you want me to repeat it,1
teacher:And I didnt say it that way did I,1
teacher:Who got them all right,1
teacher:Who got nine right,1
teacher:So youve got to decide what how what you need for the minimum number of steps for your triangle all right,1
teacher:Is it going to be all six,1
teacher:Do you need all six angles and all six sides,1
teacher:But youre not going to draw the same triangle are you;student:Okay Ill use it after,1
teacher:How you want them to draw it,1
teacher:Have you finished;student:Im up to you,1
teacher:Have you all finished,1
teacher:Are all the other ones the same,1
teacher:Now is that one of the exterior angles of the polygon,1
teacher:Is that what it says,1
teacher:Is that angle I B C,1
teacher:How come they do what;student:How come,1
teacher:Is there a way to undo that thing,1
teacher:Oh no you dont want this to join up to that one yet do you,1
teacher:Now thats one of the exterior angles isnt it,1
teacher:Like the diagram,1
teacher:How are we going with ours,1
teacher:Well no cause its all about the exterior angles isnt it;student:Do you just measure the exterior or the inside ones as well,1
teacher:Youll find out wont you;student:I think mines right,1
teacher:Remember click somewhere to get rid of the other selection and then go that that that Do you remember how to measure the angles,1
teacher:Point two,1
teacher:Do you remember how to do that,1
teacher:Have you saved what youve been doing;student:Yep,1
teacher:Well which polygons have you tried so far;student:Sir,1
teacher:Well can you do it again;student:The sides,1
teacher:Now you going to write something about it then,1
teacher:Do you know how to do that;student:Yeah,1
teacher:So did they change,1
teacher:Okay have you gone on to the second problem yet;student:Five,1
teacher:Graham,1
teacher:And lets suppose that Audra made  a big model right,1
teacher:Do you need tables,1
teacher:Do you need charts,1
teacher:All right so questions comments concerns,1
teacher:or do you have diagrams that you want to include;student:Okay,1
teacher:Do you have calculations you want to include,1
teacher:Reasoning,1
teacher:Have you hit a wall,1
teacher:So zero doesnt fit right,1
teacher:We only have a piece of it right;student:We dont have plenty of space there,1
teacher:So the slant length is equal to the roll radius for the cone right,1
teacher:For each,1
teacher:And so for this one;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:You guys feel like you have a greater starting point,1
teacher:Maybe;student:Maybe,1
teacher:Maybe;student:Maybe,1
teacher:So this goes back to that modeling of our  do you need diagrams,1
teacher:Start thinking about some cones,1
teacher:Now this  look at the difference between the bottom so the narrow rate  diameter and the wide diameter the difference between them if we look  Can I go back to the front,1
teacher:Okay so thats the largest  Yeah,1
teacher:Can we build it,1
teacher:We know two has eight right,1
teacher:So you are saying for eight you got how many a ladder of two has eight is that what you are saying,1
teacher:You said sixty and then you added eight,1
teacher:So is this right or wrong,1
teacher:But you would do that for any number whether it is odd or even you do all that;student:I was off by two so I just starting subtracting two or,1
teacher:Go,1
teacher:Lets go to this table right here,1
teacher:Lets go Gavin,1
teacher:Lets go to Nathan,1
teacher:Lets go to Julian,1
teacher:All right so  Kelsey,1
teacher:Lets go Keilty,1
teacher:And lets go here Danny,1
teacher:Now remember we had those four cups,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Maybe,1
teacher:So if it only works for four of them would that be   would it be a valid solution,1
teacher:Somebody might have  been ab raise your hand if you worked on that problem,1
teacher:Ok and how many of you built more  than one model to show a solutions to that problem,1
teacher:How many of you built three  models,1
teacher:Some of you built two  models were working on two models,1
teacher:Um do you remember anything about the  problem,1
teacher:How many of you remember which is  larger,1
teacher:Erik,1
teacher:Anybody else,1
teacher:Anybody else  remember it,1
teacher:Youre not so sure,1
teacher:You think that will help,1
teacher:Meredith,1
teacher:If you dont have enough of the little rods you can imagine  them or what you could do besides imagining them you  could take some of them off once you put twentyfour we  believe you right;student:No ok,1
teacher:Yes sir,1
teacher:You think it would be fiftieths if there would be three  oranges;student:No we didnt we could get like fiftieths,1
teacher:Did  everyone here work on that problem,1
teacher:And cuz it was a large one  on his desk and Im kind of thinking um how are they  gonna get it one the overhead when they share it with us  right,1
teacher:You all were making a few models and I know I  know Erik was making a model and hes worried about how  he can get it one his paper right,1
teacher:Um I was watching and reading and I was really interested  in some of the questions that you were sort of thinking about  as you were making your models and I noticed that everyone  made a few models in the problems you were solving isnt  that right,1
teacher:So that means because my roll radius for this cup is not equal to my slant height correct,1
teacher:Its equal to my slant height and then I also have to account for all the way down right;student:Mmhmm,1
teacher:You good Max,1
teacher:So you used Heather,1
teacher:Good;student:Okay,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Yeah;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Is that what you are saying;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Does that clarify,1
teacher:So you know start to finish whats your status,1
teacher:So what do we got here,1
teacher:Did you guys keep going with Gerry,1
teacher:Okay why did we stop;student:We kind of stopped,1
teacher:Did we get a little bit tired,1
teacher:Now we want to look at what Gerry brings to the group okay,1
teacher:You guys can create the model super quickly okay,1
teacher:Trying to make the poster;student:So do you want us to like go through and answer all these and then continue like I dont know like trying to,1
teacher:Do you still expeT2 that you would get the same answer;student:Well I dont know exaT2ly but it would be a lot,1
teacher:You know how many are in sixty and you are adding two ladders right;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Let s think so you are saying going from sixty to sixty two you added eight rods right is that what you are saying;student:Eight rods to my other rods one hundred ninetyeight,1
teacher:I am sorry did you understand four hundred;student:Oh,1
teacher:Three hundred and forty;student:Oh three hundred and forty,1
teacher:So out of this hundred you chose ten right;student:Because um ten steps is thirtyfour,1
teacher:You fix ten which has thirtyfour right,1
teacher:So are we sure about is the hundred sure is that correct now;student:And that s how you get the answer,1
teacher:Are we sure that it s right now,1
teacher:Which one you are doing now;student:How many steps we got One two three four five six seven eight nine ten,1
teacher:You have got ten steps there;student:For this one the ten steps,1
teacher:Are you saying you multiplied here;student:So one is twentysix so I multiplied twentysix by two and I got fiftytwo so then I subtracted two it is fifty,1
teacher:Did you multiply here;student:Huh,1
teacher:So that works all the time;student:Twentysix times two is fifty two and I am subtracting two minus two and that is fifty,1
teacher:For seven;student:for six,1
teacher:Well but you are doing differently now right;student:I subtracted three from twentysix,1
teacher:So you can do that for any number of steps;student:I will make a ladder with four steps I will count the rods and then I will multiply the number of rods by two and then from that answer that I got from multiplying the number of rods by two I will subtract two,1
teacher:That is for odd numbers right;student:I am the winner,1
teacher:One hundred times four;student:The one hundred times four,1
teacher:And for even numbers you want to write for even numbers;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Thirtyfour;student:Thirtyfour,1
teacher:And now this is a ladder with  two right;student:Five,1
teacher:Maybe this time  you want to use your stones for that,1
teacher:You think that s two;student:It s two,1
teacher:Two;student:Two,1
teacher:You think it s two,1
teacher:Let s  see if Jim has three does he have one fewer than Don,1
teacher:And now does Jim have one fewer than Don if Don  has four,1
teacher:Are you done;student:Six plus four equals ten,1
teacher:Okay I d like to uh to go over some of the other problems  with you okay;student:T we re all done,1
teacher:Okay let s go on to the next one with Eric,1
teacher:Could we take a look now at the  very last one,1
teacher:Okay see the problem a little different now;student:We we,1
teacher:Five right;student:Five,1
teacher:If I do like this,1
teacher:Does it look like one,1
teacher:Could that also be a ladder,1
teacher:For ten,1
teacher:Go ahead go ahead;student:Huh,1
teacher:Keep going,1
teacher:Is that right what we have done;student:Six,1
teacher:Is this what you did for one twenty,1
teacher:So I have the rule here you see what I am saying my point,1
teacher:I m going to put the rule right,1
teacher:Right Ariel,1
teacher:Is this here consistent with this,1
teacher:Does this go with this,1
teacher:Did you subtract by two,1
teacher:Did you subtract by two;student:What,1
teacher:Here did you subtract by two,1
teacher:So for what number   for odd number   this is what you do right,1
teacher:Is that odd one twentyfive,1
teacher:You have got your rule right;student:Let me see if this is,1
teacher:Are you saying you are going to build that entire one twentyfour;student:My rule uh my perfet rule I have to set it up for this huge thing,1
teacher:One twentyfour steps,1
teacher:Is that right;student:Since I had already done how many rods sixty has I just went back here look here it is one hundred and ninety eight rods and I made one for two and it gave me eight rods and then I added eight rods to one hundred and ninety eight,1
teacher:So let s do a little bit more please because  let backtrack a bit do you mind;student:You are wrong right there because,1
teacher:OK you go ahead,1
teacher:No but how I am just looking at your rule you understand what I am saying;student:Yeah I divide one twenty by two and got sixty,1
teacher:So did you do the same rule of dividing by two;student:Yeah yeah yeah,1
teacher:Is that six steps;student:Who wants to be a millionaire,1
teacher:Did you understand what I am asking right,1
teacher:You are saying for eighty right,1
teacher:Take that number divide it by half right,1
teacher:Then make the ladder with that many steps right;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Did you do that for eighty,1
teacher:For eight zero eighty;student:For who,1
teacher:You went down to sixty right;student:Yes,1
teacher:Did you do that,1
teacher:Is eighty an even number or not,1
teacher:Ariel the rule that you came up with was that you take that number divide by two is that right;student:I am nice,1
teacher:And then you said multiply by two right;student:Yeah,1
teacher:I don t see that one twenty that I told you about,1
teacher:Up to here you are getting the number for sixty right,1
teacher:So how did    Did you use the same rule again;student:This is sixty,1
teacher:Six is an even number right,1
teacher:Eighty is an odd even number right,1
teacher:Could I take the fish  in Danielles model the little fish in Danielle model and  swap it or lets take Audras big fish can I put it in Danielles  little box,1
teacher:Instead of the purple;student:Im imagining a this  instead of the  purple there,1
teacher:See my problem,1
teacher:But I guess Im asking the question uh to Meredith and  James and to Erik and Alan right now uh does this have  anything to do with your theory and the theory you tested,1
teacher:Meredith and David and Erik and Alan  does this model  have anything to do with the theory you tested David,1
teacher:All of these represent one is that a surprise,1
teacher:Are they related in any way,1
teacher:The lengths,1
teacher:You see this one  here you called the orange and red one isnt that right and  here you called one two orange and purple right,1
teacher:James;student:Exactly,1
teacher:I wonder if the rest of you see this Im saying this is an  orange and its not a purple its an orange and a red right;student:So its  basically doubled each of the length is doubled,1
teacher:I see there are  two oranges instead of one orange I see the one orange  length got doubled instead of one orange theres two right,1
teacher:Isnt that true,1
teacher:I see the orange got doubled here because there are two  oranges right;student:The red,1
teacher:Jessica,1
teacher:Kimberly,1
teacher:Is that what you were going to say;student:Well they used a purple and the red two reds make a  purple so now if they have a purple they doubled the red,1
teacher:Do the rest  of you see that,1
teacher:Ok are we all ready,1
teacher:Danielle,1
teacher:The rest of you can come and sit on the floor  but if they can turn around and try to share it so the people  in the back of the room could understand would you mind  going through it one more time particularly the different  names for the way youve represented the difference,1
teacher:I think can you see Alan and Erik,1
teacher:Dont do that now but I could ask you that question  couldnt I which is bigger a sixth or three quarter;student:Then then you do a sixth,1
teacher:I dont have enough of these  blocks so I said can you imagine it and I remember talking  and I know Andrew actually made the model when David  had a theory that he shared with um Erik and Alan and  Meredith right David,1
teacher:And then Jessica said that they already built what the  theory was thats what I heard so Id like to hear um  Davids theory again if you dont mind David if you think  you can remember your theory and Andrew I want you to  listen very carefully and Jessica and the rest of you I want  you to listen carefully to Davids theory because it really has  to do with if I were to make another model is it possible do  you think to make another model if we had more blocks it  is a possible thing to do,1
teacher:How many of  you think we can,1
teacher:Ok How many of you think we can make another model,1
teacher:Some of you arent sure how many of you arent sure,1
teacher:Merediths not sure,1
teacher:Eriks not sure,1
teacher:Danielles not sure,1
teacher:Ok How many of you are sure we can  make another model,1
teacher:Ok that looks like thats James and Alan and Andrew and  Jessica and Beth and Sarah Kelly Graham Brian Michael  Caitlin did I leave anybody out,1
teacher:Thats what you told me,1
teacher:See what happens,1
teacher:One brown was one third two browns was two thirds;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Is that what youre telling me;student:No,1
teacher:Um some of you can come around while we can hear  Andrew and Jessica  would you mind doing this a couple  of times,1
teacher:Do we have four oranges and two purples,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Well we have fortyeight whites going up to one here  dont we;student:Cuz there would be well cuz there would be  fortyeight whites equal up to one and then,1
teacher:Did you want that,1
teacher:And  I said to all of you I want you to go and make me a model of  two children right and theyre sitting at a dock and theyre  fishing and they just caught a fish right,1
teacher:Lets not make it a  sea monster and lets change it a little bit theyre fishing and  then their boat is docked somewhere do you understand,1
teacher:Mark,1
teacher:Okay is that enough;student:That two people fish and and the boat,1
teacher:Meredith,1
teacher:But one thing that  would be the same is the relative one thing you have to be  careful each of you in your own models would be the sizes in  relation to the other sizes right,1
teacher:And if somebody came in  now with a fish bigger than the boy  that would  have missed the point right,1
teacher:Or anything,1
teacher:Does it have anything to do  with the models we make in order to make an argument,1
teacher:Would you expect one model to come up with something  different than the other,1
teacher:Would it look different,1
teacher:Would the relationships that youre suppose to show  change,1
teacher:But suppose Mark had his model and suppose  Danielle made a model ok,1
teacher:And Danielle decided to make a  very little model okay a little tiny model,1
teacher:Did you want the sea monster to be bigger than the boat;student:I made the sea  monster bigger than the boat,1
teacher:What are you why are you smiling about  Mark,1
teacher:But I looked at the sea monster okay and I  looked at the boat okay and I was thinking about their sizes  a little bit right,1
teacher:Michael have you been thinking about that a little bit,1
teacher:David;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Ok so you think you can double it and you think you can  imagine  can you make one bigger than that;student:You could double that but you would have to use two rods  to make it,1
teacher:Ok the question I want to leave you all to think about Id  like you to uh first Id like to thank you for the wonderful  models you built but the question Id like you to think about  is uh is there is there a biggest model;student:If you doubled that it would be sixteen oranges   and sixteen oranges and four browns,1
teacher:Is there a biggest model;student:Thirtytwo oranges,1
teacher:We could start by that but my question to all of you is there  a biggest model,1
teacher:I was thinking about this model because we  were talking about models the other day werent we,1
teacher:Remember that,1
teacher:I remember then some people had  written  do you have a question Amy,1
teacher:Is your hand up  Audra,1
teacher:Erik,1
teacher:Do you remember,1
teacher:Erik;student:Oh,1
teacher:Yeah can you get different answers right Michael and Erik;student:if you use different models,1
teacher:How many  of you thought you shouldn t get different answers,1
teacher:How many of you are not sure,1
teacher:Have you been  thinking about that at all since then,1
teacher:Do you  remember Meredith,1
teacher:How are you gentlemen doing did you get another new  model;student:We already did that,1
teacher:Does anyone think the answer is one twenty fourth,1
teacher:So now lets talk about um Eriks theory Erik says  now that the white one on this model the larger model  where we called one the train that was made up of two  orange and one purple right,1
teacher:Do you remember how Everybody  here has worked on it isnt that true,1
teacher:Raise your hand if  youve worked on that problem,1
teacher:Ok the question how many of you have built two  models for that problem,1
teacher:For that problem which is larger  three quarters or two thirds how many of you built two  models,1
teacher:Ok how many of you  have built more than two models,1
teacher:Michael,1
teacher:Thats what you were trying to figure out;student:Thats what I was trying to figure out,1
teacher:Those of you who built  three models do you think thats all,1
teacher:Can you build more,1
teacher:This table here Jackie and James Amy you think there can  be more,1
teacher:You think thats it;student:Well we got six,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:Anybody else,1
teacher:Meredith,1
teacher:So youre thinking if you had more different size rods;student:Well maybe if you say you had a white rod and you  divided the white rod maybe you could make more models  that way if you divided the white rods,1
teacher:Do you get sick of it after a while or do  you want to be curious about it,1
teacher:Like if you took the white rod and designed one smaller  than the white rod;student:Yeah yeah,1
teacher:Is that right you were testing a theory,1
teacher:And I understand that uh lets see I  think it was on Thursday that you were working on all sorts  of problems everybody was working on something I know  this group here with Amy James and Jackie they  discovered a secret they told me do you remember,1
teacher:David has an interesting theory I dont know if Meredith  heard it tell them his theory now listen carefully Jackie you  want to hear this theory,1
teacher:Can you third that;student:One two three four,1
teacher:Can you run it by me again;student:Fourthing it might be,1
teacher:Did you,1
teacher:Did it work out,1
teacher:Did it work out,1
teacher:Did you find what you thought you would  find,1
teacher:Are you surprised that its fortyeight,1
teacher:Thats what you guessed,1
teacher:Are you going  to be able to write this up,1
teacher:You think four fortyeighths,1
teacher:Meredith,1
teacher:You think that makes sense,1
teacher:But is the difference  between three quarters and two thirds a green,1
teacher:No guessing you have to be able to  convince me ok,1
teacher:Yes  and then I know that there was a group here I think that  was Alan Erik David and Meredith who were testing a  theory,1
teacher:Did you  find is there a smallest model when you compared three  quarters or two thirds,1
teacher:Can you remember,1
teacher:Youre not sure you want to think a little bit more;student:um I think  Im not that sure,1
teacher:Erik,1
teacher:Ok Did you hear what he said;student:So therefore if  you make it a rod smaller than it they cant you cant divide  it into twelfths,1
teacher:So unless we use Merediths idea of creating new rods that  had that were smaller than the white rods then you could  make a smaller model Erik;student:Unless you made a new rod,1
teacher:Ok my next question is can you make one that shows the  comparison of three quarters and two thirds thats bigger  than this;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Are there others,1
teacher:You have another one,1
teacher:How many of you  could imagine what it looks like even though you havent  quite built it,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you could imagine what it  looks like,1
teacher:Can you see,1
teacher:Twentyfour;student:Twentyfour,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:How many of you have a model that shows that there are  twentyfour;student:I I built the model,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you have a model nearby,1
teacher:Ok so Sarah and Beth you built one you dont have  enough,1
teacher:Erin and  Jackie,1
teacher:Is that all you can make,1
teacher:Does anybody need to have that shown  what they wouldve done,1
teacher:So if you think you have an argument Erik thinks he  does raise your hand,1
teacher:Right Jessica,1
teacher:I see Sarah and uh Beth,1
teacher:Were trying to show  three quarters and two thirds is that right,1
teacher:Alan,1
teacher:Did your hand go up or  did you just wave it,1
teacher:You dont have fourths;student:I dont have fourths in my one that I made,1
teacher:Amy,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:That particular train that he  built,1
teacher:Jackie,1
teacher:Well I said you make the smallest one you can make;student:But didnt you say to make a smaller one,1
teacher:Can you make a smaller one;student:But I dont think thats the smallest one,1
teacher:What do you  think,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Yeah that train we called one right;student:Well um the orange and the red,1
teacher:And I guess the  question is that train has a particular length right,1
teacher:You can  see the length of that train,1
teacher:Questions anybody;student:Ok um well um we had this model and we uh this is two  thirds and three fourths and we think that three fourths is  bigger by one twelfth,1
teacher:Have you already solved at least one,1
teacher:Paul,1
teacher:You counted it all the way,1
teacher:So you actually counted  em huh;student:I  um showed the numbers the number in square inches and added the numbers like 28,1
teacher:So then you agreed with  Robbie,1
teacher:Did everyone have a chance to decide who was correct,1
teacher:Either Robbie or his friend,1
teacher:Did you share with your partner,1
teacher:Maybe somebody that hasnt volunteered yet today,1
teacher:No one wants to try,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Talk with your neighbor,1
teacher:the square inches;student:Uh the square inches for the,1
teacher:The area;student:The area,1
teacher:Someone who hasnt gone yet whod like to share,1
teacher:How about is it Desiree,1
teacher:Angelique,1
teacher:Connie,1
teacher:And make sure with your partner too,1
teacher:Okay Connie,1
teacher:Make sure you share,1
teacher:To find the area;student:That the area was that youre supposed to add,1
teacher:Its what was that;student:Its 1 inch squared,1
teacher:Shira,1
teacher:So what Id like you to do if you didnt do it is can you draw this picture in there,1
teacher:Cassie,1
teacher:Lets go on to the next problem okay,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:And 3 inches each so he went 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3;student:and 3 inches each,1
teacher:And got 12,1
teacher:So lets go on to the next question,1
teacher:Dont forget to share with your partner,1
teacher:28;student:12345   28,1
teacher:28 squares inside,1
teacher:So thats the area,1
teacher:His friend said what did his friend say,1
teacher:And do you agree;student:That the area is 22,1
teacher:The perimeter;student:Perimeter,1
teacher:Okay thank you Connie,1
teacher:Desiree,1
teacher:Uh Carl,1
teacher:Did you guys decide yet or are you still discussing it;student:Maybe it snows once,1
teacher:How about Devon,1
teacher:Brandon come on up,1
teacher:So you were thinking more up here towards unlikely right,1
teacher:Samuel said   Samuel go ahead you have your hand in the air,1
teacher:So I heard   did you whisper zero percent when I put zero up here,1
teacher:Inderneil,1
teacher:Does fifty percent and one half mean the same,1
teacher:Josh,1
teacher:Are you not sure now;student:I would say twenty percent because   twenty percent because,1
teacher:Are you changing your mind,1
teacher:Go ahead;student:I know the answer though,1
teacher:Okay so you re seeing five lines;student:It s twenty five percent because if   I thought if I can count from the inside   from inside each will equal up to twenty and then the lines represent every five so   five ten fifteen twenty and then twenty five goes on the line,1
teacher:No go ahead;student:So likely it s gonna be I m not gonna say the answer though,1
teacher:There s actually more than one way to write it but   Abir,1
teacher:Okay go,1
teacher:Zarra,1
teacher:Is it okay to put it anywhere on the likelihood line,1
teacher:Abir,1
teacher:Robbie;student:Robbie,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:Nothing at all,1
teacher:Um Erica,1
teacher:Lorraine,1
teacher:Alex,1
teacher:So you ready for the next problem,1
teacher:DAndre,1
teacher:Amanda,1
teacher:Equally likely,1
teacher:Jessie,1
teacher:Did the A s win,1
teacher:Do you guys know,1
teacher:Ivan,1
teacher:So we had a big discussion about that do you remember,1
teacher:Josh,1
teacher:Krishna,1
teacher:Nakila,1
teacher:Dale,1
teacher:Um Jessica,1
teacher:Would it be in the building,1
teacher:Would it be outside the building;student:no,1
teacher:You think that far;student:Youd be all the way to Pittsburg Pennsylvania,1
teacher:So you remember how to do those  number lines right,1
teacher:I bet when you did number lines  before you didnt place numbers between zero and one  did you,1
teacher:Is that right;student:no,1
teacher:Do  you see the difference in what we are doing now,1
teacher:How many of you have that  on your number line where you have one third to the right  of one half,1
teacher:Do you all know what I am saying,1
teacher:Alan,1
teacher:See what he did,1
teacher:Do you  all see that,1
teacher:Is it a third,1
teacher:Is it or isnt it,1
teacher:Andrew,1
teacher:How many of you can  imagine where a thousand would be,1
teacher:Zero third one thirds two thirds three thirds  right,1
teacher:Can you imagine that,1
teacher:You could imagine that number line,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Know what I would like you to do;student:I thought the fifth was wrong when I did  it because everything was kinda moved back,1
teacher:Know what  I would like you to do in your seats,1
teacher:You know what I would like you to do,1
teacher:You know  what Id like you all to do in your seats,1
teacher:Jakki,1
teacher:You were saying Andrew;student:Otherwise you would have to squish it all in,1
teacher:How are you all doing here;student:Well three fourths would probably be in the middle  of one fourth and one third,1
teacher:Can I ask you a question;student:Here,1
teacher:How many of you have ever used a number line before,1
teacher:Have you placed numbers on the number line before,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:Do you  all see that,1
teacher:How many of you have done that before,1
teacher:You made a number line and placed the numbers on the  line,1
teacher:You could mark  zero one two three and four,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:Is it okay to put one  third where you have two thirds,1
teacher:If that is your number  line and not rods anymore,1
teacher:Ask Jason,1
teacher:Right there;student:inside,1
teacher:So what   his friend is his friend confused;student:Theres 12,1
teacher:Cassie,1
teacher:Brandon,1
teacher:Alex,1
teacher:Okay you multiply it;student:After you found it out you would multiply them,1
teacher:Okay really quickly with your partner we asked a couple students to come up   or a student to come up,1
teacher:Talk to your partner,1
teacher:9  boxes;student:9 boxes,1
teacher:Is it Brendan,1
teacher:Julian,1
teacher:Julian,1
teacher:Alex,1
teacher:In inches;student:Inches,1
teacher:You think;student:I think,1
teacher:Oh you were thinking perimeter;student:Area,1
teacher:You think the friend,1
teacher:Yes Cassie,1
teacher:Does that really work;student:or that would be one one third,1
teacher:Im curious,1
teacher:Andrew,1
teacher:Is that what you are telling me,1
teacher:The length of  all of those rods are all one third and you are marking off  the rods the lengths of one third right,1
teacher:But when you mark off the rods to mark off where you  place the numbers is it okay then to make all those  numbers equal to one third;student:Yeah,1
teacher:That length is one third but when you place your  numbers on the number line can you write them all as one  third,1
teacher:Stacey,1
teacher:Andrew,1
teacher:Would it be okay on my ruler once I  decided an inch you know what a unit of measure is an  inch like that would be one third,1
teacher:Is it okay to say when I  make my marking okay this is one and I mark another one and say this is one again and I mark my ruler again and  say this is one and mark my ruler again and say this is one  again,1
teacher:So its true they are all one inches in length arent  they but would that be an okay way to make a ruler,1
teacher:Would that be helpful,1
teacher:Im making a ruler here for  fractions,1
teacher:David you were going to say  something,1
teacher:And on our basis of  our discussion I want you to hand in the one you have  but I want you to make me another one Okay,1
teacher:If I were making a ruler with  whole numbers and I decided that I was going to mark off  inches right,1
teacher:Its getting hard to do this isnt it;student:I think that the one tenth should be moved over just  a tiny bit,1
teacher:Who thinks they can come up here and record for me,1
teacher:How about Tarin,1
teacher:We have cut one meter into three equal lengths right,1
teacher:It could be either;student:It could be either way,1
teacher:Could it be either,1
teacher:I think what it s saying is the ribbon length of  the bow is a half a meter so each ribbon is gonna be a half a  meter long ok,1
teacher:You think six;student:Six,1
teacher:Ok so you think you re gonna get six ribbons that  are a half of a meter  a third of a meter long from that big  blue ribbon;student:and three on the other side,1
teacher:You think it s four;student:I think it s four,1
teacher:Two thirds of a meter right;student:Two thirds,1
teacher:Say this again and let s see if  we can follow him,1
teacher:What did you just say,1
teacher:Say it again,1
teacher:Do you follow what he s saying;student:This is two  thirds so then you have two more thirds left over,1
teacher:What is he  tell  me how you re hearing it,1
teacher:What did he just say,1
teacher:Ok Now you know what I heard um Andrew  saying;student:Yeah And there are six meters is in  each and it would be two thirds is one two thirds is again  and two thirds left,1
teacher:Suppose let s just use this because this is one  meter right,1
teacher:I think I heard  you saying that if you took this blue ribbon and again  imagined it as two white ribbons is that what you said when  you said I m going to divide it in half right ok,1
teacher:If I fold it this like this and then I  measure it like this this is half of two meters right,1
teacher:Now we have two meters right,1
teacher:Well not quite 3 feet is it;student:Three feet,1
teacher:Although is that really accurate;student:I got 39  plus 39 plus 39 and,1
teacher:Is that exact,1
teacher:Is it exactly 114 inches;student:Two meters,1
teacher:Yeah explain is it four;student:Would this be 4,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:So two halves make a whole;student:I just thought if it is two meters and each is a half two  halves are in a whole,1
teacher:Do you have to do that,1
teacher:Yeah do you see how to do it more quickly;student:No,1
teacher:Make sense;student:Six meters,1
teacher:So is there is there a rule here;student:It d be twelve,1
teacher:Ready to go on,1
teacher:Do you need to;student:Well it says two meters but do we have to get another one  of these,1
teacher:Can you just use this one to measure,1
teacher:Can you find some way to do that;student:This you could,1
teacher:Ok let me ask you Jessica this is two meters right,1
teacher:Can you picture that white  ribbon over there if we took it and divided it into thirds,1
teacher:Would I be looking at  one of these ribbons,1
teacher:So this is kind of what you pictured here  wasn t it Andrew,1
teacher:What do you think Jessica and Laura,1
teacher:Caitlin,1
teacher:Class,1
teacher:How many of you are absolutely certain convinced nobody  can persuade you otherwise;student:Three,1
teacher:Danielle,1
teacher:You re absolutely sure,1
teacher:You  want to come up here,1
teacher:How about the rest of you in your  seats,1
teacher:The  quarters are easy huh,1
teacher:See that,1
teacher:Is it really a quarter of a meter when it s folded,1
teacher:Graham,1
teacher:Class,1
teacher:Pardon,1
teacher:How many of you  think you know,1
teacher:Why don t you  go show that to Jackie,1
teacher:It s three  pieces right,1
teacher:Kimberly,1
teacher:Did you all see what she did,1
teacher:You re going to;student:I have to go,1
teacher:You think you could only get two bows that are two  thirds;student:Two,1
teacher:From this blue ribbon;student:Four,1
teacher:You think four;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Think about that again ok,1
teacher:How many of you finished problem  number one,1
teacher:With the white ribbon,1
teacher:Do you know how big a meter is supposed to be,1
teacher:How many of you are convinced that your answers for  number one are correct and can prove it to me,1
teacher:How many of you still  aren t sure you have answers but you re not totally  convinced,1
teacher:Looks like we have  some work cut out for us isn t that right,1
teacher:Kelly,1
teacher:So you re telling me I have one meter of white ribbon and I  split it in half I have two bows;student:Well you re supposed to like  there s one meter of white  ribbon and then you have to split it into um a half so I got  um two bows,1
teacher:What  about the next one if I have one meter of ribbon and I have  to make bows that are one third meter in length how many  of you think you know that answer to that one,1
teacher:And you re  sure you have the answer to that one,1
teacher:Caitlin,1
teacher:How many of you are  absolutely convinced about that,1
teacher:Jonathan,1
teacher:Is that one meter;student:One meter,1
teacher:Ok but now with the white ribbon the first  question can you see Danielle on there the white ribbon,1
teacher:Josh,1
teacher:Hafasa;student:Because even though more yellows were picked that doesn t meant that there s more yellows than green,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Are they mixed up,1
teacher:Krishna,1
teacher:Is there anyone in the room that feels like we need to do some more before we can make our guess,1
teacher:Robert,1
teacher:Indraneil,1
teacher:Okay ready,1
teacher:Is that s what s confusing you,1
teacher:Did you hear what Josh said,1
teacher:How many of you think this is the combination in the bag,1
teacher:How many of you this is the combination in the bag,1
teacher:And anybody think this is the combination,1
teacher:Areesh,1
teacher:Who wants to come up,1
teacher:Go ahead;student:I want to say something,1
teacher:Do you remember,1
teacher:First of all was there anybody in the class who s changing their estimate from the first time I had you take a guess,1
teacher:Do you think it s unlikely equally likely or likely I m gonna pull a yellow tile out of the bag,1
teacher:Marcus,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Can I have your attention please,1
teacher:Abir,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Hafasa,1
teacher:Who hasn t had a chance to draw from the bag;student:I did it already,1
teacher:Sarab,1
teacher:Could it be impossible;student:In the middle of the likely and equally likely,1
teacher:Listen to my question for a minute;student:FiftyFifty,1
teacher:Could it be impossible that we re gonna pull a yellow,1
teacher:Would it be impossible on the next draw;student:If you take out all the yellows then it s impossible to take out to a yellow,1
teacher:That we would draw a yellow;student:No,1
teacher:Is there anybody in the class who thinks it s impossible that we could draw a yellow on the next draw,1
teacher:Sarab,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Do you have a guess or do you have a comment or a question you want to ask us,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Any questions you have for me,1
teacher:Great let s   oh go ahead,1
teacher:So  let me tell you a little bit about the problem then I am going  to say go to it right,1
teacher:Do you all see  that,1
teacher:Gold ribbon,1
teacher:Ok Now from these bows from this ribbon we can make  bows and depending upon how much ribbon we use the  bows you see can the bows can be different sizes they can  be different shapes right;student:1 meter,1
teacher:Now now look at the first problem see the first  problem,1
teacher:Do you think you understand what the first  problem is asking,1
teacher:How many of you think you  understand,1
teacher:Chat with your partner,1
teacher:Andrew you want to  give it a try,1
teacher:Ok let s see what Andrew has to say,1
teacher:So if you were to take your white ribbon can you imagine  the white ribbon being this long;student:So you would have to figure out  that,1
teacher:Can you imagine that,1
teacher:One meter right,1
teacher:Hafasa do you have a question,1
teacher:Is it possible that a lot of tiles were picked up more than once,1
teacher:So even though maybe you re guessing that there s twentyfive reds in the bag it s possible   that someone picked the second red twice,1
teacher:Okay go ahead;student:I want to call on somebody to help,1
teacher:You guys are making estimates already huh;student:Red,1
teacher:You okay;student:Red,1
teacher:Okay we can   we can stop and take our guest now or we can keep going what are you guys gonna do;student:My arm is starting to hurt,1
teacher:Amanda,1
teacher:Krishna,1
teacher:Is that important to get to thirty do you think;student:Keep going,1
teacher:Are you just not sure,1
teacher:What does it say on the chart,1
teacher:Robert how about you,1
teacher:Devon,1
teacher:Let s see what   sorry Sarab keep going,1
teacher:Do we need one more,1
teacher:Two;student:One more,1
teacher:Ok who think that looks different;student:Twentysix and four,1
teacher:Sam,1
teacher:Do you want another minute to think about it or do you want to call on somebody to;student:Well   I have it in my mind but it s   it won t come out of my tongue,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Erin,1
teacher:Alan,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:So go for it Raul,1
teacher:Half of the sum;student:The measure of an angle formed by two secants that intersect the exterior of a circle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs,1
teacher:You see what I mean;student:Mmhm,1
teacher:You did something;student:I did something,1
teacher:Nobody,1
teacher:You,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:The R S U,1
teacher:Katie did you get that one,1
teacher:Where are you Margaret;student:Where is,1
teacher:You changing your mind;student:Well,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:Maybe,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Do you see what I mean;student:I see,1
teacher:Michaela,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:The arc,1
teacher:Leah,1
teacher:Melissa,1
teacher:Michaela,1
teacher:Do we have anything to back up either one of those more than the other,1
teacher:Or do you want to just do the next row and see what we come up with,1
teacher:Katie,1
teacher:Say that again,1
teacher:Is that a lot to do for a general rule,1
teacher:It works;student:Maybe but it works,1
teacher:So now we have maybe three different ways to find it,1
teacher:The 125 and the 100 that we already went over;student:Both of them got the same answer as the other one that Katie just said and that really proves it,1
teacher:Do you understand what I mean,1
teacher:Melissa,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Ben,1
teacher:Maybe its 40 times two;student:The arcs 40 degrees and since angle A V C is 80 maybe its 40 times times two,1
teacher:You did triangle sum;student:triangle sum again,1
teacher:Do you remember how it all happened,1
teacher:Remember,1
teacher:What  do you think,1
teacher:That was very interesting so I was just wondering when  you saw the big model that was built and you saw that the person  that got one quarter of the candy bar got five thirtysixths more  than the person who got the ninth of the candy bar is that much of  a difference do you think,1
teacher:That is an interesting conjecture isnt it;student:Then  the five left if you divided them up into fives it would be five ten  fifteen twenty twenty five so each person would get one and one  fifth,1
teacher:Did you hear that what Andrew said,1
teacher:How many of you follow what Andrew said,1
teacher:Can you all imagine that,1
teacher:Do you all follow that,1
teacher:How many people follow that so  far,1
teacher:Danielle,1
teacher:So if I were to  say things like one half one third one fourth one fifth right;student:So its so its less,1
teacher:If I  were talking about these numbers then would you know which are  bigger and which are smaller,1
teacher:How many think you know which  of these numbers  are bigger and which are smaller,1
teacher:Can you imagine the model,1
teacher:You all hear what David is  saying,1
teacher:Call something one and draw it,1
teacher:You  proved it doesnt quite  work that way for fractions does it,1
teacher:Is that  right,1
teacher:How is  that is that better,1
teacher:Do we have enough of these,1
teacher:Thinking hard,1
teacher:Did it,1
teacher:Mark,1
teacher:Five thirtysixths more;student:Well the people that got one fourth got more by fivethirtysixths,1
teacher:How many of you remember that,1
teacher:How many of you believe that,1
teacher:So thats the difference;student:Umm Well we had to  thirty six whites  And it took five whites to  get from onefourth to oneninth one ninth or one ninth to one  fourth so five thirtysixths to get is the answer,1
teacher:You have any questions on that,1
teacher:How many of you  remember that,1
teacher:Do you remember that,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Does it work that way with fractions;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Youre calling the purple four;student:The four rod which I think was the purple rod,1
teacher:Is that what you said,1
teacher:I mean five plus four is nine I  believe that does that that work,1
teacher:Erik did you want to say  something,1
teacher:Do you know what I am curious about,1
teacher:Can you imagine this with the rods,1
teacher:Melissa,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:It is,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Is that the problem I gave you,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:DoeStudentt that what that says;student:One A and three Bs,1
teacher:DoeStudentt that say one A,1
teacher:A to the one times B to the three,1
teacher:Cant it,1
teacher:Yes Phoebe,1
teacher:Is it;student:Three,1
teacher:Are we did I tell you to plus;student:So youd have to put A cubed plus B cubed,1
teacher:So you can just have them next to each other right;student:A times B,1
teacher:Did someone find the rule,1
teacher:Blake;student:We did,1
teacher:One right;student:One squared,1
teacher:Is it,1
teacher:Yes Tiffany;student:How do we do  like that,1
teacher:Does that work,1
teacher:IStudentt this A two A squared times A squared times A squared;student:Three A twos,1
teacher:Yes Brett;student:Okay,1
teacher:DiscuStudents it with your group,1
teacher:Did you come up with a rule;student:Well yeah that too but what did you guys get for the rule,1
teacher:Ask the question,1
teacher:So are yes Austin,1
teacher:On which problem;student:I got A and then 27,1
teacher:So you found that when we are multiplying the same base did you notice that the base had to be the same,1
teacher:Can you break that down even further now,1
teacher:Lucia did you have a question,1
teacher:Whats that;student:No I was asking the same thing as she did but I heard you explain it,1
teacher:So youre gonna multiply your exponents right;student:The number by that,1
teacher:Did you guys have it,1
teacher:You have your rule;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Dont you need three A squares,1
teacher:Cause iStudentt that dont you have A squared three times;student:Oh,1
teacher:Are we all focused,1
teacher:Cause iStudentt that your multiplication;student:He was the smart one,1
teacher:Yes;student:Okay I got it,1
teacher:You get Does that make sense to you;student:Okay,1
teacher:Is it,1
teacher:Now didnt you just prove it;student:One,1
teacher:Now was it as hard as you thought;student:Okay,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Whats going on,1
teacher:Anybody,1
teacher:Suzy,1
teacher:Matt,1
teacher:Are you ready for the activities,1
teacher:Michaela,1
teacher:Whats that,1
teacher:Leah,1
teacher:Correct,1
teacher:Go ahead,1
teacher:Youre on a roll lets go,1
teacher:Now is A to the one over A to the one equal to A to the zero;student:Okay,1
teacher:Start thinking can I do a multiplication problem can I do a division problem,1
teacher:Does A to the zero mean A times zero;student:So,1
teacher:That its being multiplied,1
teacher:Do we have a rule,1
teacher:We have a rule,1
teacher:Lucia,1
teacher:Does that make sense;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Yes;student:Oh,1
teacher:Well what what is You have A divided by B right,1
teacher:A;student:But you dont know,1
teacher:Suzy,1
teacher:Are they like terms,1
teacher:Yes Im listening Lucia;student:Ms Scott,1
teacher:Cristie,1
teacher:Do you need me Robert;student:All right,1
teacher:You have a question,1
teacher:Really;student:So it would just be one,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:But is that what youre saying;student:Cause if any number multiplied by zero is zero right,1
teacher:So can we combine unlike terms;student:Nnhnh,1
teacher:David;student:yeah,1
teacher:To the left So somewhere like this maybe;student:Left,1
teacher:Would you call on  someone,1
teacher:Lets here from Jessica;student:I heard Michael say that  the half would have to be on the positive side its integers they keep going if it is  on the positive side its not going to be equal halves the negatives would be larger  than the positives and if you even make the number line bigger zero is right in  the middle so it is going to have to be half,1
teacher:Alan;student:That is not half anymore,1
teacher:By the way do I really have four numbers positive;student:Since you added on the four then that mean you now have four numbers positive  but three numbers negative,1
teacher:Is that what we have on the number line;student:You have five numbers positive   zero one  two three and four,1
teacher:Numbers up to four,1
teacher:Does that number line end at four,1
teacher:Does it end at five;student:No,1
teacher:So you would put a negative one half between negative one and negative two;student:From here down you are negatives so that means any number  here cannot be equivalent to a number over there  so that means if you were dividing this part up into fractions   you would have to put one half mark in the negative right about there,1
teacher:What do you think about that Meredith;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Yeah let us hear what Meredith has to say,1
teacher:It makes sense to you,1
teacher:Can you understand  that I am confused,1
teacher:You want to keep it there Meredith,1
teacher:How many of you want to keep it there;student:No,1
teacher:How many of you want to put it some where else;student:No,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:Amy,1
teacher:If Mrs Deming decided to make the line  go over here should it matter,1
teacher:Does it matter;student:If I didnt know it was negative,1
teacher:How many of you believe it should go right on top of the one,1
teacher:You meant to put it on top;student:We just could not get it right on top to fit,1
teacher:Want to think about it,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:Are you   all thinking of your numbers,1
teacher:Maybe someone will convince you to change your it or maybe you  will convince them that you will not change it Okay,1
teacher:In other words if we were going to put three thirds we are going to go  underneath,1
teacher:Is that fair,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Are you all ready,1
teacher:Do we have some volunteers,1
teacher:Come on Audra,1
teacher:Jessica are you volunteering,1
teacher:Graham,1
teacher:You would put it under the zero;student:But if I did not know it was negative I would put it under the zero,1
teacher:Should it really matter,1
teacher:David;student:You have to do something to keep it there,1
teacher:Did you say that Michael,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:You all hear what David is saying,1
teacher:Can you mark one half right where you put it like  put it underneath so we can see it;student:then one half would be there,1
teacher:So somewhere like this maybe;student:Left,1
teacher:Michael,1
teacher:Would you call on  someone,1
teacher:Erik,1
teacher:Want to call on  someone,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Beth is your hand up or just thinking,1
teacher:Erin,1
teacher:No no ideas,1
teacher:People have some  ideas,1
teacher:Mark,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:How many think you know  which are bigger and which are smaller,1
teacher:If I were talking about  these numbers do you know which are bigger and  which are smaller,1
teacher:So if I were to say things like one half one third  one fourth one fifth right,1
teacher:Should we continue this tomorrow,1
teacher:So am I hearing James say that one half is another name for two fourths,1
teacher:Audra;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Am I hearing you change you mind;student:even fractions so that,1
teacher:Can zero and one half be the  same,1
teacher:How do you feel about that,1
teacher:Not sure,1
teacher:Want to think about that,1
teacher:How many of you believe that it should go to the left of threethirds,1
teacher:Andrew and then James,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:Would you place one half here would you place number one half here;student:I think that is the confusion,1
teacher:I agree  that you could find the one half the length between two and three I agree but  could place the number one half here,1
teacher:Is that allowed;student:It has to be two and one half,1
teacher:Andrew,1
teacher:Meredith,1
teacher:It is starting to make some sense;student:It is like a ruler here it has the inches one half one and one half two and one  half three and one half four and one half five and one half and so on,1
teacher:How many think there is something else that is the   confusion;student:No,1
teacher:Michael,1
teacher:Is that true,1
teacher:And you are telling me you would place it with 1 to the right of threethirds,1
teacher:Jakki,1
teacher:How many thinking  about the number lines,1
teacher:How about that Meredith,1
teacher:You may want to talk with each other for just a minute to see if you are sure that  the number line that Meredith made is clear,1
teacher:Why dont you just talk with your partner  about the number line to see if it makes sense to you,1
teacher:Any more questions,1
teacher:Anyone need more  time to talk,1
teacher:I think Michael was first so we will let him go first,1
teacher:What was your question;student:Ohm,1
teacher:Can you pretend these space numbers are not there,1
teacher:Do you have any trouble   with that,1
teacher:Remember  what Alan did,1
teacher:When Alan magnified a piece of the number line,1
teacher:Do you  remember that,1
teacher:Did you see what Alan did here,1
teacher:Know what I would like you to do;student:Because that why I  thought the fifth was wrong when I did it because everything was  moved back,1
teacher:Remember,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Alan,1
teacher:Erik,1
teacher:Dont go away Erik whats the next question,1
teacher:Andrew,1
teacher:Okay Do you want to call on Andrew to put in the one quarter;student:So its not its just  approximate cause I dont think,1
teacher:Want to call on someone,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Beth is your hand up or you  just thinking,1
teacher:Erin,1
teacher:Mark,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:I know this is  getting hard right,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:More towards zero;student:I think it should go more towards zero,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:Its getting hard to do this isnt it;student:I think that the one tenth should be moved over just a tiny bit,1
teacher:How many of you remember what Alan did,1
teacher:It that what you did Meredith,1
teacher:Yeah it gets kind of crowded sometimes doesnt it;student:It is just easier to see,1
teacher:Why dont you share that go ahead,1
teacher:Why dont you go talk to Alan or Meredith,1
teacher:Are you prepared to argue that  position,1
teacher:Okay so you are telling me that that is just another name for one;student:Because,1
teacher:Ok  Are we ready to come back and share our ideas,1
teacher:Are you ready,1
teacher:Ok  Meredith go ahead,1
teacher:Michael,1
teacher:Jessica you are making a face are you confused,1
teacher:I wonder if we could have four  thirds if we went further,1
teacher:Meredith just said I  want to make sure you are all able to hear what she just said I believe she said  that you cannot have four thirds in this interval but I asked the question   if you  extend the interval could have four thirds,1
teacher:Bryan what did you have to say,1
teacher:You want to say something else Alan,1
teacher:Meredith what is your  comment,1
teacher:One and two thirds right;student:And  then I went from zero to two it would be one and one third  two and   two thirds  and then one and three thirds,1
teacher:Alan,1
teacher:You have a comment yes Mark,1
teacher:Ok  Any one else have a comment,1
teacher:Not going to say any more;student:and  Jakki,1
teacher:Also on that first number line Meredith also kind of showed me she knew where to put those numbers right,1
teacher:Can you see  that,1
teacher:So maybe they were you worried about lining them all up carefully;student:Yes,1
teacher:Is that what  you did Meredith,1
teacher:Erik you were going to say something,1
teacher:Jessica,1
teacher:Alan what were you going to say,1
teacher:So this clearly defines where we have  differences of opinions right,1
teacher:Okay now in the particular region over here she has two thirds in this region see  where I am pointing;student:The way I thought when you divide it up into fractions then you have a line  going to the fraction but Meredith just put the fractions above the number line  without the line so that meant she was labeling the area,1
teacher:Ok so if you were to put the number three thirds on the line;student:You are doing it the way Eriks talking about it you would   put one third over that area and you would put two thirds in   that area and three thirds in that area because this would be  representing one third   both of those would be two thirds and   three of those would be three thirds,1
teacher:Let us hear what Meredith has to say;student:No,1
teacher:Let us hear what Meredith has to say;student:But,1
teacher:But I did hear Meredith say that this piece is three thirds did you mean that Meredith;student:You should label one whole and under it put three thirds,1
teacher:You mean that;student:Yeah this whole entire piece right here,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Ok Amy and Jakki you were going to say something;student:She is trying to say to label between  it because if someone said if someone looks at it and they did not know a  thing about a number line they would probably think that the one third would be  between the one third and two thirds that is why she labeled it also in the middle  because if someone saw it and did not know what a number line was they would  probably think one third is between the one third mark and the two third mark so  she is just labeling it in the middle to make it less confusing,1
teacher:Between the one third and the two thirds in that region represent two thirds of the  line;student:Yes,1
teacher:Is that any different;student:Oh,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Graham,1
teacher:Or do you think there would be  more,1
teacher:You think there would be is that what you are  saying;student:Uhm  Exactly the same,1
teacher:I want you and your  partner to talk to each other for a minute,1
teacher:What  about you two,1
teacher:You think itll be twenty one,1
teacher:Michael and all;student:I found more combinations,1
teacher:Maybe more,1
teacher:You think its  twenty,1
teacher:Okay Brian and Jeff,1
teacher:You changed your mind;student:Well we think its the same,1
teacher:Do you remember what we talked about,1
teacher:Dana and Stephanie,1
teacher:And you got one;student:Five,1
teacher:So what about you,1
teacher:You think its going to be less;student:Less,1
teacher:That would be more,1
teacher:Did you change your mind from the same;student:We said not the same,1
teacher:Nineteen;student:Nineteen,1
teacher:If you didnt  have opposites you would have only had eight,1
teacher:Did anybody ever think it might be  seventeen,1
teacher:And maybe even nineteen,1
teacher:Did you think there might be more;student:Yeah,1
teacher:What;student:Well if you got seventeen you must have  some of the patterns that you already have,1
teacher:Okay these two here are these the ones you are talking  about,1
teacher:Are they;student:This one and this one are complete opposites,1
teacher:Or did you think  there might be seventeen,1
teacher:Could have there been nineteen,1
teacher:Oh could you find one;student:Maybe,1
teacher:Okay so you really think that sixteen is right;student:No,1
teacher:An odd numbered tower,1
teacher:Is there any that was,1
teacher:Was it important that you have even number of towers,1
teacher:So does it always happen in opposites;student:Well you just think of patterns and like opposites so like,1
teacher:So the opposites is what made the sixteen;student:Well if you didnt have opposites we only have eight,1
teacher:You think there would be more towers than sixteen with just  three cubes;student:There would be more towers,1
teacher:You said that there is about eight,1
teacher:How is it going;student:Put that on the bottom,1
teacher:Very good;student:Very good,1
teacher:Robert;student:Yeah,1
teacher:So if I want to think of this as a pizza right,1
teacher:Lets think of these each of these as a pizza right,1
teacher:That s what you just told me right,1
teacher:Lets follow that thinking right,1
teacher:So  b  will would mean you choose the topping right;student:So,1
teacher:And red will be you don t choose it right,1
teacher:Fair enough,1
teacher:Ok so you have four toppings so let s go through our toppings right;student:Mhmm,1
teacher:So this would mean you either choose peppers or you don t;student:We have,1
teacher:The rest of you follow what Stephanie is saying;student:And then heres the peppers and if theyre you,1
teacher:All of you were Able to follow it;student:Mhm,1
teacher:What;student:Amy tell me what she was saying,1
teacher:Does it matter,1
teacher:Well let Amy do it because I m curious;student:Okay,1
teacher:You like that huh;student:Its easier to explain the two thing with this because there are only two colors,1
teacher:Are you Jeff,1
teacher:Wait which one are you,1
teacher:Brian if you would write up that math thing that you were  just telling me about if you could explain what you were  saying about sixteen and the eight that would really help me  to think about it when I go back and read these okay,1
teacher:Does that one have an opposite,1
teacher:You see what I am saying,1
teacher:Okay now before I say anything does anybody want to  change their minds;student:Six seven eight we got eight,1
teacher:Does anybody want to change their minds from what  theyve said here;student:Yes,1
teacher:Everybody wants to change their minds,1
teacher:And then now you want to change  your mind,1
teacher:All of them taking one off;student:Because one took it off and made a whole difference,1
teacher:You think that might be,1
teacher:Okay what about Michelle Michelle and  Erin,1
teacher:Michelle,1
teacher:You said it was less;student:2 We said it was less and eight,1
teacher:So shouldnt it be more,1
teacher:And you think  it was less,1
teacher:You mean there is something about math to it;student:Sixteen minus eight is eight,1
teacher:calls on a student,1
teacher:You still think its the same;student:Oh I think they are the same,1
teacher:Michelle,1
teacher:Because she hasn t played with it for a  long time right,1
teacher:Did everybody figure out how many different towers they  can make,1
teacher:Can I get everyones attention,1
teacher:I want you to talk to your partners,1
teacher:If  you think you have it at your table raise your hand,1
teacher:Karina,1
teacher:Work that out with  your partner with your table,1
teacher:You sure it works for every single rod,1
teacher:You  tested it,1
teacher:Did you write down the formula;student:Length,1
teacher:Romina I know you have an idea here but you have to work  on the language for it right;student:Okay the length of the square units,1
teacher:I think what  you re trying to tell me is that you used two of these right,1
teacher:Isn t that right,1
teacher:Do you understand Michelle,1
teacher:Is that true,1
teacher:Three because it s three long right;student:Wouldn t that be 3,1
teacher:Is that three still;student:Three long,1
teacher:Is that true here length times 1 times 1;student:Length times one times one,1
teacher:Light green,1
teacher:Right but you re giving me a formula for one rod right;student:Length times we could do  length times width times height,1
teacher:Do you understand my question,1
teacher:Can you find your white rod,1
teacher:You think its six if he starts with  six and he sells three then he will have as many as dad,1
teacher:What do you think if grandpa has three and he then sells  three does he have as many as dad;student:It might be three,1
teacher:None or zero so would he have as many as dad;student:none,1
teacher:And then would he have the same number as dad,1
teacher:We usually do right,1
teacher:You know what these  are,1
teacher:Let s do a very quick warmup okay,1
teacher:How many of you how many people think there is no rod  that s half as long as the blue rod;student:We can do it now,1
teacher:Raise your raise your  hand,1
teacher:Do you need some help,1
teacher:Michelle,1
teacher:You see what she was saying,1
teacher:You follow her,1
teacher:What were you going to say Sandy,1
teacher:They look pink here  though right,1
teacher:Can you imagine that in your head,1
teacher:Does that work;student:How about length in units times width in units times height  in units equals volume,1
teacher:In another case;student:Don t we know that all ready,1
teacher:Again one more time;student:A simple answer,1
teacher:Shivani,1
teacher:So the first thing were going to do is were going to remember what it is we did okay,1
teacher:So lets read the problem first,1
teacher:Lets read,1
teacher:Ready,1
teacher:Okay turn to a neighbor and talk,1
teacher:Jaedon,1
teacher:So are you looking at these words in blue,1
teacher:Iyanna,1
teacher:Chaniya,1
teacher:So are you looking at these numbers these numbers;student:Show how you know your answer is correct,1
teacher:Nia,1
teacher:Lets go a little bit deeper okay,1
teacher:KaLon,1
teacher:You actually wish that this mathematician would actually make this a numbera complete number sentence,1
teacher:Dangelo,1
teacher:KaLon,1
teacher:Victoria,1
teacher:Getting really tired,1
teacher:You know what I mean by stacking them like  this,1
teacher:Do you  understand the question Brian,1
teacher:Fair enough,1
teacher:You mean the square unit;student:The square unit,1
teacher:Why  don t you say the square unit,1
teacher:So I m stacking them right,1
teacher:So it doesn t matter how many you got;student:Yeah even if you did them in squares,1
teacher:I know some of you are still working but I would like  to get started so those of you who are working quietly finish  up what you are doing okay,1
teacher:It ll have a different surface area;student:It ll have a different surface  area,1
teacher:What are you saying Michelle,1
teacher:It s always going to work,1
teacher:Did you do volume yet;student:Volume,1
teacher:Would the surface area change do you think,1
teacher:Does  the volume change,1
teacher:Do you think the volume will change,1
teacher:You re getting tired of working on this;student:It s time to share,1
teacher:Does it work,1
teacher:Up to wh where have you thought about it;student:Okay,1
teacher:You too Shelly you haven t played with this in a while so you can help me;student:Yeah I guess you could say that,1
teacher:And this is three with one red right,1
teacher:Weve spent a lot of time  thinking about this train havent we,1
teacher:Now in the way of review can  anybody tell me if I give this train the  number name 1,1
teacher:Danielle,1
teacher:So if we call red and orange 1 were  calling it the number name 1 youre saying  that it takes 12 of those little white ones to  equal up to the length of the orange and the  red,1
teacher:And so you would give  this the name 112,1
teacher:Now this is  what weve been answering right,1
teacher:Can we now replace these color names for  the train and for the white with number  names in that sentence,1
teacher:Can we change the  color names of white and the train with red  and orange to number names at this point  now,1
teacher:Can we rewrite this with numbers in  that sentence,1
teacher:Read me read me what it says there;student:6,1
teacher:Ok twelve go ahead;student:Uh twelve,1
teacher:Ok say it again;student:I do,1
teacher:Read the second line,1
teacher:Arent you calling this one,1
teacher:Ok wait maybe Im wrong  what did you say,1
teacher:Can everybody take out the rods  and make this train with the red and the  orange rod,1
teacher:I think were ready to talk about this one  ok,1
teacher:The difference;student:Yeah but I think if you took one sixteenth and one forty eighth and  you put it up to it it,1
teacher:Meredith;student:I said four fortyeighths,1
teacher:They have an interesting  David has  an interesting theory I dont know if Meredith heard it tell them his  theory now listen carefully Jackie you want to hear this theory,1
teacher:You know this model gentlemen dont you;student:Well before,1
teacher:Meredith,1
teacher:Youre thinking thats possible;student:No meaning,1
teacher:You will use  someone elses and you help them ok Meredith,1
teacher:Do you understand how you  would get fourths and thirds out of that,1
teacher:And then they built something else;student:We basically came to discuss Davids original model,1
teacher:Did it work out;student:Cuz I just doubled it,1
teacher:Did it work out,1
teacher:Did it work out;student:What,1
teacher:I mean did you did you find what you thought you  would find,1
teacher:How about a ruler would that help;student:Here youve got yeah you need another one of that,1
teacher:Are you surprised that its fortyeight;student:Yep fortyeight,1
teacher:Thats what you guessed;student:No thats what I thought it would be,1
teacher:Are you going to be able to  write this up,1
teacher:But is the difference between three  quarters and two thirds a green,1
teacher:Ok lets  see I havent had a chance to  David,1
teacher:Alright so we could  rewrite this as this right,1
teacher:You can talk  to your partner again if youd like,1
teacher:Ok lets see how about Id  like to hear from Michael I think because he  was working with Meredith and they were  arguing about this,1
teacher:Does that make sense,1
teacher:But lets get back to this one does this  make sense,1
teacher:For those of you who really  werent too sure how to begin does this  make sense to write it this way,1
teacher:Actually can  we go back to that first one for just a minute  and maybe write this one as a number  sentence,1
teacher:Remember this one the red and  orange train,1
teacher:Can we rewrite this as a  number sentence now,1
teacher:Someone different,1
teacher:Ladies,1
teacher:Do you have twelve parts here;student:Um twelve,1
teacher:Brian how about you,1
teacher:Do you think that you  could do it,1
teacher:Ok a number sentence uh how about  well I would like to hear from Brian and Danielle,1
teacher:There seemed to be a lot of  discussion going on over there I want to  hear from them,1
teacher:Danielle do you want to  start,1
teacher:How about anybody else,1
teacher:If  youd like to come up though just raise your  hand,1
teacher:Do you want them up there,1
teacher:Gregory,1
teacher:Do you think you  could answer this question,1
teacher:If you have an idea raise your hand,1
teacher:Let me hear from Graham,1
teacher:Is that the same thing 1 and 12 over 12;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Are  they the same thing,1
teacher:Are they equal to each  other,1
teacher:If you have an idea about that raise  your hand,1
teacher:Why dont you try,1
teacher:Laura,1
teacher:Going back to  that division we were working with last  week does anybody think they could write  this situation here the question Im asking  here in a number sentence that would work,1
teacher:They should talk among themselves about it,1
teacher:Its a good question isnt it;student:Well uh,1
teacher:Shes thinking in  general terms does that always work,1
teacher:Are we taking away when you divide;student:No youre not taking away when you divide,1
teacher:What we want to do is take this second  sentence here  how many 16s are in 1   and change it completely to a number  sentence ok,1
teacher:Ok Ive heard some ideas,1
teacher:Can we write this now as a number sentence  including these numbers,1
teacher:What are you adding on from here to here and here to here  when this is no reds right;student:Because youre just adding the extra block on,1
teacher:Would that work;student:That  would make thirty and you would call the oranges thirds,1
teacher:Using thirty white rods to call one;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Well where Im still having a little  trouble is um  Okay so youre talking about  these blocks right,1
teacher:Does that make any sense Brian;student:And y will be the ones that go up and down  basic graphing skills,1
teacher:Brian do you think so;student:Yeah,1
teacher:That s fine and  good but I want to know how you got that twentyfour  okay,1
teacher:You re done;student:Amy we re done,1
teacher:Make sure okay;student:We cant,1
teacher:Are you both convinced of that;student:It s six,1
teacher:So six;student:Yeah white and blue blue and white yellow blue and  yellow white,1
teacher:And you re sure that there were six,1
teacher:Positive there aren t seven;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Can I  ask you a question,1
teacher:Can I  ask you a question,1
teacher:You re all done;student:We re done with this,1
teacher:Okay people are still recording these so  you still hold those okay,1
teacher:Can I ask you a question,1
teacher:Throw out your idea again for them so we  can hear it;student:Well,1
teacher:You know what I d like you to try on the back while we re  waiting;student:Yeah,1
teacher:What you were,1
teacher:Why dont you try saying  that again,1
teacher:Could  you see in your heads the three with one red,1
teacher:Can you imagine those,1
teacher:Can you see them,1
teacher:You know there are exactly three;student:Mhmm,1
teacher:You all could imagine that;student:One with the red in the middle and one with a red at the bottom,1
teacher:I can see my little stack here and this little stack here there is only one of them  and its all blue no red right;student:And each of them get a block like  added to them how do I ok,1
teacher:Does that make sense;student:They already have one red,1
teacher:You understand my question;student:Well like to here I mean we would say,1
teacher:Do you understand my next question Jeff;student:That were just following the pattern,1
teacher:What Im asking,1
teacher:Thats thats really isnt that  interesting,1
teacher:Its hard to see the other way isnt it;student:Yeah Im having trouble seeing Pascals  triangle,1
teacher:If I were to make a larger grid right Brian;student:Mm hmm,1
teacher:Colors;student:Mm hmm,1
teacher:Thats what Im hearing you say;student:Mm hmm,1
teacher:So say it again;student:Like why,1
teacher:Well do it and see okay;student:Cause six plus six is twelve,1
teacher:You think so;student:Three six nine twelve,1
teacher:You re convinced,1
teacher:Two twelfths  by one twelfth;student:Two twelfths two,1
teacher:Or two twentyfourths right;student:Yeah one twelfth,1
teacher:Is that right,1
teacher:So here this was the difference in your little model  and here this was the difference in the bigger model correct,1
teacher:Im  asking you to imagine ok so this is Im going to pull this out for a  minute this was your one twelfth right,1
teacher:And this was your one  twelfth or two twentyfourths right,1
teacher:Can you predict how many more reds and how many more whites;student:It would probably be a much much bigger because if the model is  say this big it would need more reds and more whites than these   cause these are small,1
teacher:So can you imagine one a certain size  and able to predict how many reds and whites,1
teacher:You understand my  question,1
teacher:Is that another model there Audra;student:And this is the same here,1
teacher:You have four greens  and you have three purples its just that here you have is it really  different though,1
teacher:Are these models I guess this is my question to you  are they really different,1
teacher:You see what Im saying;student:No,1
teacher:Can you think of another,1
teacher:Youre using thirty white ones to make your train is that what youre  telling me;student:Thirty of the  thirty ones and,1
teacher:One twelfth right;student:One twelfth,1
teacher:Ok I see that you see that too David and you  showed us this one too but now thats not my question ok,1
teacher:Ok where are we,1
teacher:But why dont you work with these;student:But I just cant remember them,1
teacher:Did you hear was Alan said Eric;student:It s easy to imagine you could divide it into zillionths,1
teacher:Did you hear what Alan said,1
teacher:Do you want to say that one more time Alan,1
teacher:Andrew;student:100 dust bugs could fit in a dust particle,1
teacher:The rest of you will you help me with this,1
teacher:You re telling me that this bar over here that is marking zero right,1
teacher:You think it would be fiftieths if there would be three oranges;student:No we didnt we could get like fiftieths,1
teacher:Will it work,1
teacher:Do you still expect that you would get the same answer;student:Well I dont know exactly but it would be a lot,1
teacher:How are you gentlemen doing did you get another new model;student:We already did that,1
teacher:See my problem,1
teacher:Do you understand my question;student:Well,1
teacher:I couldnt help but overhearing that and Im also talking to  David here but I have a question for you and David to think about  Ok,1
teacher:Uh I probably want you to tell David what you just told Mrs  Phillips;student:Mmm hmmm,1
teacher:He was doing a  different problem right David,1
teacher:I want you to tell me  this is my question to David also Meredith do you see any  connections between these two models ok,1
teacher:Instead of the purple;student:Im imagining a this  instead of the purple  there,1
teacher:Caitlin,1
teacher:Does he have one  fewer side by side,1
teacher:Does he have one fewer,1
teacher:So your answer is eight tens and one one,1
teacher:Does  that make sense,1
teacher:Do you think you can explain it,1
teacher:Three hundred and twentyfour bows if I had eightyone  meters of ribbon;student:So that would be if you had eight one and then you d have  to multiply that by four you get three hundred and twenty four bows,1
teacher:Wow are you up to measuring that out;student:Three hundred and twentyfour meters would be the entire  perimeter of this school,1
teacher:The calculators not going past a million,1
teacher:Do you feel better about  being able to explain this,1
teacher:Ok Im not concerned about that but Kim s nervous  because what if she gets called on now;student:Oh I could tell you how I could explain mine,1
teacher:Ok How far did you go;student:It  quit,1
teacher:Ok  Alright if you had to say where the twentyseven came  from do you remember,1
teacher:Are you still feeling confused about it;student:But I m confused,1
teacher:Yeah isnt it;student:Yeah,1
teacher:It s a different way isn t it;student:You add sixty and twentyone and you get  eightyone,1
teacher:Have you tried it for any other numbers to  see if it works,1
teacher:Does it have to do with that three meters of ribbon;student:The first problem that we had to do was if we had three  meters,1
teacher:Thats a ten also ok so here you have three times two tens  thats six tens and this is two more tens;student:I was thinking it would be alright because this this two is  in the tens column,1
teacher:Ok listen to this now I want you to  I want you to start  fresh ok;student:Right all we did  was we kept the twentyseven but we just doubled the three,1
teacher:Beth;student:Because,1
teacher:That means two tens and one one Laura;student:Twentyone means that two times,1
teacher:Is that a two;student:In multiplication you dont carry,1
teacher:Ok Kimberly is that a two;student:Well I learned to do that,1
teacher:This is a one but my question  is is that a two,1
teacher:Alan;student:I dont know why,1
teacher:Twentyseven,1
teacher:You added;student:We just kept on adding,1
teacher:Seventyeight is that possible,1
teacher:Maybe you added twentysix times;student:No I guess we counted wrong,1
teacher:Ok now you said there was another way you could do it  three times twentyseven you said you could multiply it  rather than add it three times;student:Yeah that would be eighty one and that number would be  eightyone,1
teacher:Do you know how to do  that,1
teacher:Did you learn that,1
teacher:Laura,1
teacher:You said you carried three times seven is twentyone why  dont you write that down three times seven is twentyone;student:And you get eightyone,1
teacher:Does that mean two plus one,1
teacher:Or  three,1
teacher:Ok so Im confused when you say carry the two youre not  carrying two of these;student:And then we had the one,1
teacher:So is that where the three is coming from;student:Right so that would be seven times seven,1
teacher:Is it;student:The third is just like the three its like a regular number,1
teacher:So youre starting the light is starting to go on for me ok;student:That would mean each meter  gets three parts so you multiply this by three and I get a  hundred and fifty so thats how many bows you can get,1
teacher:Andrew,1
teacher:Ok maybe maybe  James;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Anybody else;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Is that when you measured it in the hall  Erin,1
teacher:Did you have one third meter string,1
teacher:Did you measure it out like that,1
teacher:You ended up with twentyseven of them;student:Well we measured out um yeah we measured twenty seven meters,1
teacher:Twentyseven of those one thirds;student:Yeah we,1
teacher:You said nine divided by a third is the same as nine times  three;student:We timesed,1
teacher:Do you understand my question,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:What Id like you to do  many of you did different things right,1
teacher:Um well um Meredith its so  good to see you back and Meredith is probably  curious to know what we did and since you were able  to write to us to tell us what you did we have some  information Michael what did you want to say,1
teacher:Ok I guess what Im  curious about is how much you could um prediT2  about ribbons and bows maybe without having the  ribbons and bows in front of you if you try to  remember some of the things you did and as you try  to explain to me your thinking um on some  prediT2ions so Id like you all to imagine how many of  you can imagine in your heads a meter,1
teacher:A ribbon that  is a meter long,1
teacher:Did anybody do it that way;student:No Im trying to think,1
teacher:Ok so youre telling me that in the one meter you have  three thirds is that what youre telling me;student:Well well see we had three meters so you put three down  and youre trying to divide it into thirds so you put another  three down and then you times it and that would equal up to  nine,1
teacher:Jackie,1
teacher:Erin,1
teacher:You ll have to say that again,1
teacher:So when you say the second number of the fraT2ion you  mean the number on the bottom in the fraT2ion;student:That means if I had seven and I wanted to  divide it into fourths you go seven times four equals  twentyeight,1
teacher:That seems to  work,1
teacher:Ok I want you to think about something else then ok;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Class,1
teacher:How many of you know how to prove it,1
teacher:Ok that  looks like everybody I think Danielle is your hand up,1
teacher:Is that a two;student:I carried the two but,1
teacher:Kind of over here;student:Kind of,1
teacher:Jackie Danielle does that make any sense;student:Thats why because you have three meters and take  and  you have three one thirds in each meter so three three  threes and that equals nine,1
teacher:You said three divided by a third  gave me three times three or nine,1
teacher:Some of you did it differently some of you said  three divided by a third is equal to three plus three plus  three or nine,1
teacher:How many of you did it that way,1
teacher:How many people measured it out,1
teacher:How many of you took  nine meters of ribbon and measured it out,1
teacher:And how did you do it to convince yourself uh  yes,1
teacher:Nice and loud so they can hear you;student:Um you go three,1
teacher:How many of you can imagine in your  heads,1
teacher:Ok Did you discuss it with Kimberly;student:Twentyseven meters,1
teacher:Literally Erik you re literally tying yourself down;student:We re tying ourselves down,1
teacher:Who s  gonna tell me,1
teacher:Kelly,1
teacher:Anybody else,1
teacher:Is that where we left off,1
teacher:Do you want to  continue working with this to finish the sheets,1
teacher:How many  of you would like to continue working with this,1
teacher:How  many of you want to make bows,1
teacher:Ok this is two meters right;student:You have the blue and you have this is and you take you  have a white,1
teacher:Ok you re convinced of that;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Can you do it carefully to be sure that you can explain it  maybe;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Jessica,1
teacher:Ok lets lets let s hold out  Brian what were you just  saying;student:No its four it s four six eight ten  and then there was  that odd and then there was that two thirds one,1
teacher:Michael,1
teacher:You could imagine a meter right,1
teacher:You can see a meter,1
teacher:How many of you aren t sure,1
teacher:Can  you all in your heads imagine a third,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Andrew,1
teacher:Kimberly,1
teacher:Did you finish the two meter ribbon,1
teacher:Andrew,1
teacher:Well what about so you re telling me that two  divided by one halfwhat did you say Andrew,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:Do you all understand what Brian said  how many of you understood what Brian said,1
teacher:Can someone try to say it one time for me so I  understand it,1
teacher:Who else  wants to say it for him,1
teacher:Let s hear someone else say it for me;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Can someone else try  to say it for me,1
teacher:Can we hear from someone else,1
teacher:Who  wants to try,1
teacher:Well how many of you believe that two  divided by one third is six is six,1
teacher:Someone want to give a try saying it again,1
teacher:Erin,1
teacher:Anybody else,1
teacher:How many of you  can imagine a third,1
teacher:Is it longer than this,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Ok and you could persuade us everybody that that s the  case;student:That s what we think,1
teacher:Right here,1
teacher:Alright so then this is the third of a meter this is a third  between these two;student:And then the other one right there,1
teacher:Go ahead go ahead we dont know if were right so go  ahead;student:But doesnt it,1
teacher:Youre sure;student:Nine,1
teacher:Are you really sure;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Or does it work;student:Umm,1
teacher:Does it always work,1
teacher:You know what it means  right,1
teacher:Something to think about right;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Would it  work if you had twenty three times and seven three times,1
teacher:Ok so  that worked didnt it,1
teacher:Does that help you figure out a way  to make it work every time,1
teacher:Ok just for a time out for a minute  while youre working on this for those of you who are  finished with that problem I asked you how many ribbons  one third meter in length can you make from three meters of  ribbon right,1
teacher:Did you have a calculator check your computation;student:We have six thousand five hundred and sixty one yards um  meters of ribbon,1
teacher:Ok James;student:Because three times three is nine,1
teacher:Laura,1
teacher:So why dont you talk  nine;student:Oh three nine,1
teacher:Why dont you all sit and talk to your partner for a minute  and confer and see what you think;student:Um I think you could have made um oh I forget um,1
teacher:Is it shorter than this,1
teacher:Is it shorter than this length,1
teacher:Youre the only ones who can imagine how much shorter it  is,1
teacher:Can you imagine a  third of a meter,1
teacher:Thirtythree and a third,1
teacher:How many of you  imagined it cut into three equal parts,1
teacher:Ok and Jessica and Alan were a little more explicit they  were trying to aT2ually tell me the  how long those parts  are right,1
teacher:Well did you figure it out Alan;student:Yay we got,1
teacher:And uh and so youre telling me in this meter  stick because there youre telling me there are a hundred  meters here,1
teacher:A hundred what  here,1
teacher:A hundred centimeters;student:A hundred centimeters,1
teacher:This piece over here;student:Because it only goes up to ninetynine but theres an extra  length that could be a centimeter,1
teacher:Ten times ten;student:Ten centimeters plus ten centimeters plus ten  centimeters is,1
teacher:So what was the question  that you posed to me,1
teacher:If we had three meter length ribbon is  that what you said earlier Brian,1
teacher:We had three meters I can imagine three of these now I  could imagine a ribbon a third of a meter right;student:Um,1
teacher:A hundred centimeters here,1
teacher:Don has the four put  them together and he has one fewer,1
teacher:If you can would you raise your hand,1
teacher:Is it shorter than the width of this room;student:No,1
teacher:You ve got 12 meter right,1
teacher:Do you understand my problem,1
teacher:You  two need to talk to each other,1
teacher:To Danielle Do you know inaudible the same thing;student:If  you put them together you only get six,1
teacher:Those are lines;student:I made these,1
teacher:Ok um Alan  and Kimberly wanted to share with you the way they  were thinking about the twelve meters divided by  bows of two thirds of a meter right,1
teacher:We had twelve  meters of ribbon and were making the bows two thirds   can you kind of look to see because Im going to ask  you to write about what they did I want to ask you to  write about what they did and I want to make sure that  what they did makes sense to you or doesnt make  sense to you because if it doesnt make sense their  job is to uh either convince you or you convince them  so can you all give us your attention here for a  minute,1
teacher:Questions;student:The long line is the divider of each meter   The brackets are dividing the thirds up so  there are two thirds there are two thirds there are two  thirds there are two thirds and if you count up how  many two thirds there are youll eventually get down  to eighteen and thats how many bows you can make  of two thirds out of twelve meters,1
teacher:Any other questions  comments,1
teacher:How many of  you would like another explanation,1
teacher:Fair enough,1
teacher:Ok so one more time  please,1
teacher:Question;student:The bracket has two thirds  under it which means those are the two thirds to  make your bow and if here are two thirds here are two  thirds here are two thirds here are two thirds and  you keep going on to the end until you get up to  eighteen and thats how many bows you can make  out of two thirds each meter um of twelve meters of  ribbon,1
teacher:How many of you um  understood this explanation,1
teacher:Raise your hand if you  understood the explanation,1
teacher:Does that  make sense,1
teacher:How many of you would  like the explanation broken down again,1
teacher:But if they are  13 meter you can only make 3 of them,1
teacher:Is that clear now,1
teacher:To give me my nine meters is that right,1
teacher:How many of  you understand that,1
teacher:Could you imagine twelve meters of ribbon,1
teacher:How  many of you can imagine,1
teacher:Sort of,1
teacher:Is it going to be  more than nine meters,1
teacher:Its going to go past that hallway you  think,1
teacher:Yeah whos class is that on the corner;student:Mmm hmm,1
teacher:Its going into Mrs Warwicks room isnt it,1
teacher:If  were rolling out that ribbon ok,1
teacher:So now Im starting  with twelve meters of ribbon one half meter bow  right,1
teacher:Talk to  your partners,1
teacher:What you  talked about,1
teacher:You guys  are on half a meter,1
teacher:Do you change  your mind,1
teacher:You said that if they are half  meters you can make 24 of them right,1
teacher:Raise your  hand if youd like it again,1
teacher:How many of you know where I got the  one,1
teacher:Andrew,1
teacher:Lets do the one on top,1
teacher:Kamora;student:123456,1
teacher:Do you remember,1
teacher:Thats how you went about solving;student:Five and four is nine,1
teacher:Is that how you made your comparison,1
teacher:Fourteen take away five equals nine is that how you solved  it Aaron,1
teacher:So you had eleven;student:We um,1
teacher:you had the eleven for the men,1
teacher:Wait just a minute tell me again;student:Gerardo Its six look,1
teacher:Four so if Don has four does he have one fewer than Jim  cuz Jim has three;student:Four,1
teacher:Does he have one fewer;student:No,1
teacher:Does  he have one fewer,1
teacher:Does he have one fewer or one less,1
teacher:Does Jim have one less,1
teacher:Does he,1
teacher:Were going to count;student:Both of them have 6 white spaces,1
teacher:Tamaz is going to say it one more time so that I can then point at it so we can all see it;student:Both of them have 6 white spaces,1
teacher:Okay turn and talk to a partner,1
teacher:My question to you is does that  secret work here,1
teacher:Brian,1
teacher:James,1
teacher:David,1
teacher:You think ten Erik;student:Well I think I think ten,1
teacher:Ok do you all  understand how we get twelve of those onemeter  length,1
teacher:How many of you understand that,1
teacher:With the  eleven cuts,1
teacher:One cut my second cut  my second cut gives me three cuts each three meters  long right,1
teacher:Is that what you  did Alan and Kimberly,1
teacher:Did the  brackets show one third,1
teacher:Graham,1
teacher:Can you see that,1
teacher:Andrew,1
teacher:Its twelve divided by two thirds  now before when I asked you how many one third  ribbon lengths when there were twelve meters of  ribbon what did you tell me the answer was,1
teacher:Everybody,1
teacher:Andrew,1
teacher:Meredith,1
teacher:Is a meter  longer than the width of this room,1
teacher:Nine  divided by three is three thats one way the other way  is if I do it by cutting right,1
teacher:There are going to be two cuts right;student:Two,1
teacher:That would be  about nine meters,1
teacher:The width of the  classroom,1
teacher:It happens to be an eight by eight classroom;student:Its eight by eight,1
teacher:David;student:Twentyseven meter hall comes to this hall coming  down here its about from the door to um to the  middle of to when you start going down there,1
teacher:Oh so all the way where the interseT2ion is where you  can make a right Danielle;student:I was going to say that um to the door the outside  door down to where you take a right,1
teacher:If you go into the bathroom ok thats very interesting  Michael;student:If you go right to the bathroom then you will go up,1
teacher:So the  next thing to can you imagine in your heads what a  third of a meter is,1
teacher:How many of you can imagine in  your heads about a third of a meter,1
teacher:Im not going to  ask you exaT2ly but you have some idea what a third  of a meter is you know what we mean by a third of  something dont you,1
teacher:How many of you know that,1
teacher:And you can imagine a third of a meter right,1
teacher:We  did that yesterday in the beginning of class Meredith  wasnt here but what we did Meredith remember  some of you aT2ually made string of a meter and you  made your string into thirds and you had your third of  a meter length I remember that right,1
teacher:Um I guess I wanted  to discuss with you a problem that I believe um  somebody was working on in the hallway it might  have been Erik and um the problem had to do with I  remember I asked you how many bows can you make  from ribbon thats a third of a meter in length if you  have nine meters of ribbon right,1
teacher:And I think  everyone was able to solve that problem right,1
teacher:So Im imagining a ribbon along the floor going  out one meter and Im imagining one third meter  lengths and Im counting them right,1
teacher:From the chalkboard to Graham;student:Graham,1
teacher:But some of you didnt count them  some of you found an interesting way of getting your  answer without counting right Alan,1
teacher:And you remember that;student:When we were measuring the school,1
teacher:Gregory;student:No,1
teacher:Is a meter about the length of this chalkboard;student:Yes,1
teacher:Is it bigger;student:No,1
teacher:Is it smaller;student:No,1
teacher:Um ok thats very interesting um most of the  hands were up but I guess Brian yours wasnt up no,1
teacher:You cant imagine the length of a meter,1
teacher:Caitlin,1
teacher:You want to hold your hand up Caitlin so  the rest of the class can see again,1
teacher:About that big,1
teacher:Does that  help Brian,1
teacher:Not bad huh,1
teacher:Ok Brian,1
teacher:Hey thats pretty good isnt it;student:Yeah its a little its going to be a little short,1
teacher:Graham,1
teacher:How many of you do that kind of in  your heads,1
teacher:But if you had to tell someone here is like part of the  school about nine meters;student:Well just uh if like eight meters plus one meter,1
teacher:This is eight meters;student:Because this is eight meters,1
teacher:What was that,1
teacher:How  many discovered that,1
teacher:How many of you discovered  that yesterday,1
teacher:How many of you arent sure,1
teacher:How many of you think its  going to be smaller,1
teacher:How many of you think the  ribbons are going to be bigger,1
teacher:How many of you  arent sure,1
teacher:Thats an interesting idea ok maybe thats I hadnt  thought about it that way Erik but lets suppose were  making identical kinds of bows were making can we  talk about a standard bow in here;student:Come to think of it you could have you could have  three bows well I mean you could have each bow  thats three meters long and you can have one bow  that you have to twist and everything using three  meters of ribbon making it small and just like twisting it  every which way,1
teacher:Brian youre not convinced right,1
teacher:Are you  imagining that,1
teacher:Ok Now Im going to cut that ribbon to  make bows right,1
teacher:Starting with nine meters now  Im making three meter bows right,1
teacher:Do you imagine that,1
teacher:Is there anyone who cant imagine that,1
teacher:Audra,1
teacher:Is there a third cut,1
teacher:Its all done right;student:No,1
teacher:Kimberly,1
teacher:How many of you think the ribbons are going  to be bigger,1
teacher:Ok lets see how many of you think its going to be  smaller,1
teacher:Talk to your partner for a minute,1
teacher:Raise your hands if you think you know,1
teacher:Is that right;student:Yeah,1
teacher:Does that  make sense,1
teacher:Well thats what we wrote here didnt we,1
teacher:Nine times  three right,1
teacher:The three nine times,1
teacher:Audra,1
teacher:Yeah but but what you did is you said there are  three times and there are three times again and there  are three times again right;student:You put the number down three times and you  counted,1
teacher:Erin,1
teacher:One two three four five six seven eight nine is that  right;student:Um,1
teacher:That was another way is that  right,1
teacher:That some people did that problem,1
teacher:Now Im  wonder I dont really um all these are wonderful  ways right,1
teacher:Whatever way youre thinking about it the important  thing is can you do a different problem and work it out  with these ways,1
teacher:I still have  my nine meters of ribbon can you imagine that,1
teacher:My  nine meters,1
teacher:Remember that Erik,1
teacher:Ok so you added this up to nine you added this up to  nine you added this up to nine and all those nines  gave you twentyseven;student:We did the three three times and we added it up to nine,1
teacher:Yes Lucia,1
teacher:You think its six Aaron;student:I think its six,1
teacher:Thats two times two right,1
teacher:Simon I also have a nice little assignment for you;student:Y equals,1
teacher:But you had problem but you didnt understand problem uh what was it again 23;student:But I am busy correcting,1
teacher:You didnt have that one right,1
teacher:Yes maybe your neighbor would like to join as well;student:Sure,1
teacher:Are you able to do this;student:Yes he does,1
teacher:Take a line,1
teacher:Arnold;student:Were going from line two,1
teacher:Is it working or not,1
teacher:You got the red one;student:Yes with the red one,1
teacher:Lets see where is the diagram;student:Uh negative,1
teacher:And I think it is much more Arnela listen for a second please,1
teacher:What;student:Begin with the starting number,1
teacher:Do you have the black one already;student:Y is minus twoandahalf X minus twoandahalf X and the starting number is,1
teacher:So that is also negative three yes,1
teacher:Shall I um with the blue one I will lets see is that right,1
teacher:Are you able to see now,1
teacher:Or do we have more here,1
teacher:Shall I demonstrate it on squared paper;student:And,1
teacher:But at what problem did you end,1
teacher:Who can I give the pleasure of an answer booklet,1
teacher:How about just making it by yourself;student:Teacher may I,1
teacher:How far are you,1
teacher:Sorry;student:At 26,1
teacher:And you are not sure yet either,1
teacher:Uh what letter shall we pick for that,1
teacher:Come on,1
teacher:What letter will we take for the other axis,1
teacher:Where do you have the other one,1
teacher:Did you also have a question,1
teacher:And did it work out,1
teacher:Where exactly are you,1
teacher:At which problem are you now;student:Right now,1
teacher:Which problem did you complete,1
teacher:And this one you havent done;student:At 27,1
teacher:May I briefly interrupt,1
teacher:So upwards is always positive yes,1
teacher:I will have a look at those tomorrow yes,1
teacher:Which one of you ever heard of Pyth Pythagoras,1
teacher:Julie;student:Julie,1
teacher:Any questions about this;student:I already knew that,1
teacher:No no questions;student:Yes but it is no,1
teacher:Yes do you;student:Oh like that yes yes I got it,1
teacher:Myrte,1
teacher:Suzanne,1
teacher:Jeffrey Maarten,1
teacher:Sorry Willem,1
teacher:Annelies and Myselle;student:Oh oh sorry you have it right here,1
teacher:Come over here for a second,1
teacher:What does G eight say,1
teacher:Sorry;student:Um,1
teacher:Maybe later you should add for yourself an ex a written explanation on how you got that square root of five okay,1
teacher:You knew that the square root of 16 was equal to four,1
teacher:Yes;student:And um look this is for example um the regular square,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Rick,1
teacher:Ravi,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Ruben;student:It has it has one,1
teacher:Maarten,1
teacher:Julie,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Do we have any other rightangled side in there,1
teacher:Rene,1
teacher:Willem,1
teacher:Then you still have to add that page right,1
teacher:One of these triangles;student:Um four in total comes off because one of those uh,1
teacher:Convinced,1
teacher:Very well we are now able to in the same way as exercise what,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:If I know that the surface area of the large square is 169 can I say something about how long this sloped side is,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Leni,1
teacher:Yes;student:So if you have for example a really large number for instance uh well yes I dont know uh for example with five numbers,1
teacher:With alcohol it wasnt linear either right,1
teacher:Was that linear,1
teacher:This is the answer of the inequality equation okay,1
teacher:You need to present this okay,1
teacher:You get an answer of 17 halves okay,1
teacher:You buy seven,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Thats why although it may be tedious for the applied problems of inequality equations okay,1
teacher:Is it okay,1
teacher:Is it okay,1
teacher:So youre at two now,1
teacher:Are you going to catch up with that before the next class;student:Yes two B,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:Because;student:I didnt do the additional exercise at all,1
teacher:This one you did make;student:But I did do this,1
teacher:You too Arnela;student:Yes,1
teacher:Did it work out;student:Eh,1
teacher:The price of the pears and the price of the persimmons and even the basket will be included as well this time right,1
teacher:Sorry,1
teacher:We got it because the 12 could be divided perfectly into it here right,1
teacher:Its 144 right;student:One hundred forty four,1
teacher:Eight,1
teacher:This the answer of this inequality equation is wrong isnt it,1
teacher:Arent you missing the 50 here;student:Seven hundred fifty,1
teacher:The answer is not this though is it,1
teacher:Huh,1
teacher:But the answer to the problem has to be this right,1
teacher:When asked to work out this inequality problem this is This has to be the answer here right,1
teacher:Seventeen over two right;student:One hundred seventy over 20,1
teacher:That should be that way right;student:So teacher if you do it like this is it correct,1
teacher:Ueda how far did you go,1
teacher:Pears right,1
teacher:Its 70 times 20 so its not 140 but its only one zero right,1
teacher:There the six is 60 youre missing one zero arent you;student:Who cant read this,1
teacher:Were going to try to see if this is true or not okay,1
teacher:Didnt I teach this to you before,1
teacher:Because here we got 12 a number that was divisible right;student:Since its divisible,1
teacher:for that well have to do some hard work during this class session yes,1
teacher:Charles;student:Im starting,1
teacher:Are you going to participate and would you sit up straight though;student:That way I can see better,1
teacher:This line is a descending line can you also tell that from the equation,1
teacher:Douwe,1
teacher:Are you still able to see that or not,1
teacher:Its a bit light isnt it,1
teacher:Like this,1
teacher:It is also shown in your book right,1
teacher:Dirk,1
teacher:Um Arnold,1
teacher:Niels,1
teacher:Charles;student:No,1
teacher:Maarten,1
teacher:Excuse me;student:In scuba diving,1
teacher:Have any of you ever dived,1
teacher:And you Ricardo,1
teacher:Excuse me;student:The braking distance,1
teacher:Is that also still possible,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Which of those four equations would you like to do,1
teacher:Any volunteers,1
teacher:You succeeded;student:I succeeded,1
teacher:Succeeded,1
teacher:Succeeded even marvelously;student:I didnt,1
teacher:Linda,1
teacher:Yes because you skipped a class right;student:Make my day,1
teacher:Marion did you succeed,1
teacher:A little bit;student:Yes a little bit,1
teacher:No that was not linear was it;student:No,1
teacher:Succeeded;student:Not exactly,1
teacher:Okay Tonny,1
teacher:Peter;student:Twentythree,1
teacher:Sharone,1
teacher:Okay Stefan,1
teacher:Okay Mina;student:Y is a half times X plus one,1
teacher:Maarten,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:No;student:No,1
teacher:I should write the totals too shouldnt I,1
teacher:Yes;student:I just have a question,1
teacher:Was it clear for you guys;student:Yes,1
teacher:It stays tricky doesnt it,1
teacher:You get the picture;student:Oh right,1
teacher:Yes;student:Okay,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:It disappears completely;student:Sir thats the first sentence of,1
teacher:Meanwhile how far did you get,1
teacher:You are beyond that;student:No I am I am already beyond that,1
teacher:Youve even gotten as far as 36 by now,1
teacher:Steffi,1
teacher:Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:What;student:Sir are the additional assignments due tomorrow,1
teacher:Yes;student:Sir,1
teacher:Iris,1
teacher:Sixty;student:Sixty,1
teacher:But do you need the whole 60;student:Uh 16,1
teacher:Do you understand why these two are the same,1
teacher:Do you need to include the B or not,1
teacher:Do you understand what is going on;student:Yes,1
teacher:Steffi is it possible;student:No because uh,1
teacher:So can you do anything with it,1
teacher:Yes;student:Oh well that is an easy one,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Marjolein,1
teacher:Erik,1
teacher:You dont know;student:I dont know,1
teacher:Erik,1
teacher:Go ahead and pick a number,1
teacher:Marjolein,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Were you able to follow this at 15;student:No you have to look this one you have to,1
teacher:The things I do;student:I really dont understand how you do it,1
teacher:You replace the X by a three and then what does it say,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Is it possible that the A and the C are the same,1
teacher:So you can add A plus C Yes,1
teacher:Is that possible;student:Yes,1
teacher:Could they be identical;student:Yes,1
teacher:It could be the same right,1
teacher:Daan,1
teacher:Tim,1
teacher:Why dont you just point it out in your notebook then I know What no tables;student:Below the uh,1
teacher:Did you do it yourself without using a table;student:Yes,1
teacher:Not with the help of the answer book I hope;student:I did it with the help of,1
teacher:Did you draw the table;student:Um below the below the multiplication um sign,1
teacher:Correct,1
teacher:Pleun tell me tell me tell me,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Three;student:Um three,1
teacher:Thats all;student:Yes three,1
teacher:Marian,1
teacher:Three times;student:Three times,1
teacher:Here;student:And on the left uh the minus three,1
teacher:You see,1
teacher:Daan,1
teacher:We are going to do that again in question C This was question B right,1
teacher:Hans,1
teacher:Sander,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:You understand that one,1
teacher:Are you going to show me on Friday that you have completed up to paragraph five,1
teacher:Yes;student:I will,1
teacher:Yes;student:Sir,1
teacher:Does it matter what you take as the width or the length;student:From the top to the bottom,1
teacher:Yes;student:No but look over here,1
teacher:Plus three C can you do anything with that;student:For example Q is two B,1
teacher:Yes but hey four times three and three times four is the same as well isnt it;student:Yes but that is not an H,1
teacher:Yes;student:Oh,1
teacher:Do you understand it,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Marian what is it,1
teacher:Marian,1
teacher:Which assignment,1
teacher:What is it,1
teacher:Yes;student:Sir can I ask you one more thing,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Did 15 work out;student:No we didnt do,1
teacher:Is it that bad;student:Dont make me cry,1
teacher:Yes;student:The numbers on your triangle have completely faded,1
teacher:Excuse me;student:do wrong,1
teacher:What does it say,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:You see;student:Oh here,1
teacher:Do you see that,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Yes;student:Is it if you uh write it down like this because you have to measure the other rightangled side,1
teacher:Was the answer booklet wrong or were you wrong;student:But I looked in the answer booklet and it was wrong,1
teacher:Do you still remember where you had difficulties,1
teacher:What did you say;student:Yes okay,1
teacher:Do you know where you were,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:It was uh chapter one wasnt it,1
teacher:And yes right now you are calculating variables arent you,1
teacher:Myrte;student:It is 14,1
teacher:Sorry,1
teacher:You keep track of this a little too I hope,1
teacher:Is this one clear to you guys;student:Thats just the nature of the assignment,1
teacher:Really;student:Yeah sure,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Are you writing down what you are doing though,1
teacher:Not only uh writing down the answers,1
teacher:What is this;student:One hundred ninetysix square meters,1
teacher:What exercise are you working on,1
teacher:Here I have the table yes;student:Now I dont understand any of this anymore,1
teacher:Everything is clear for you guys,1
teacher:De Boer;student:Four times the square root of 20 is eh,1
teacher:Easy,1
teacher:They were werent they,1
teacher:No,1
teacher:Are you going to proceed with the work,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:Yes;student:No but here,1
teacher:Is it possible that they could be the same,1
teacher:Could this and that be the same then;student:No,1
teacher:Yes;student:Okay,1
teacher:Are you able to sniff your way through it,1
teacher:Are you able to sniff your way through it;student:Huh,1
teacher:Or are you doing okay,1
teacher:What does it say;student:Plus or times,1
teacher:Fifteen didnt work;student:Yes okay,1
teacher:Yes;student:Are you actually wearing a microphone,1
teacher:Whats stopping you from filling it in;student:Yes but I had,1
teacher:Is it coming along,1
teacher:Fifteen;student:I dont understand 15,1
teacher:What,1
teacher:Can you do that,1
teacher:Did you succeed with 15;student:Why wouldnt it be possible,1
teacher:Just go ahead and do 16 together,1
teacher:And then in a minute you will also did you succeed with 15,1
teacher:Which is 50 times the H Yes;student:Yes,1
teacher:This one you dont know yet correct;student:Fifteen,1
teacher:Can you show me;student:Yes,1
teacher:Did you make a drawing of this;student:This one,1
teacher:Beware thats simply 110 right;student:Oh like that,1
teacher:Which one;student:make over again,1
teacher:And two B plus three C can you add anything up here;student:Eleven As,1
teacher:Are you able to proceed now,1
teacher:Where are you at,1
teacher:That one is clear,1
teacher:Can you move along,1
teacher:Yes,1
teacher:You are succeeding,1
teacher:But do you understand what you are doing;student:Yes okay but,1
teacher:Are you just starting now;student:Yes,1
teacher:Or are you at uh five,1
teacher:Which one dont you understand;student:But I dont understand,1
teacher:Do you understand it,1
teacher:Are the diagrams coming along;student:Teacher,1
teacher:Which eight;student:And were still clueless,1
teacher:With that table,1
teacher:Peter,1
teacher:Hm;student:The total was 1000 yen wasnt it,1
teacher:Okay Watabe,1
teacher:How about you did you finish them all,1
teacher:Are you still in the middle,1
teacher:How about this,1
teacher:Its greater if over here is greater okay,1
teacher:It holds true okay,1
teacher:People who are done writing okay,1
teacher:Here okay,1
teacher:The right mark or the wrong mark okay,1
teacher:Have it written okay,1
teacher:Doing it like that okay,1
teacher:How about it,1
teacher:The next ones are all smaller than right,1
teacher:That means it changed here right,1
teacher:When we were doing equations we said to solve for X that will make expressions like these work right,1
teacher:But the answer that one day is it just the fifteenth day,1
teacher:Youre already done writing,1
teacher:Then will somebody say it for me;student:From 15,1
teacher:When you cant say it is true put the wrong mark okay,1
teacher:Please put marks also over here okay,1
teacher:Then ones after that are 16 17 okay,1
teacher:The left side okay,1
teacher:When we substituted 13 into this X okay,1
teacher:The left side is greater right,1
teacher:That means since this side is greater if we ask about the size relationship okay,1
teacher:The greater than symbol goes in right,1
teacher:That means can we say that putting in 13 for X holds true for this inequality,1
teacher:Well the direction is different right,1
teacher:Because of the fact that we cant say it okay,1
teacher:Thats right huh,1
teacher:You put a mark here right,1
teacher:Are they the same,1
teacher:Since theyre not the same do you understand,1
teacher:Thats right huh,1
teacher:You put a wrong mark right,1
teacher:Then please put marks here okay,1
teacher:Is it like this,1
teacher:Then just now well Higashi said it for me but well would you say it for me,1
teacher:How about the nineteenth day,1
teacher:Then if we think like that did it became more,1
teacher:When were asked how about when its equal okay,1
teacher:We could think things like this but we can get a viewpoint of it becoming more right,1
teacher:When its an inequality okay,1
teacher:The increased amount right,1
teacher:So um about the inequality if you thi if its an equation we can also do it exactly here okay,1
teacher:Then write in X milliliters in the figure and this relationship okay,1
teacher:That X is milliliters okay,1
teacher:Its 50 plus X right,1
teacher:Over here;student:Over here,1
teacher:So for that all you have to do is use that symbol right,1
teacher:Izumi,1
teacher:Hm;student:bigger than,1
teacher:Somebody,1
teacher:How about it,1
teacher:Okay if we do that its when they become the same right,1
teacher:Then did you understand that one just now,1
teacher:Somebody,1
teacher:Then for that okay,1
teacher:Since if its the nineteenth day there isnt any more right,1
teacher:Money right,1
teacher:but that one we call one day is of course the fifteenth day but it mightve been on the sixteenth day right,1
teacher:of these well it was one of these days right,1
teacher:Okay then are most of you done,1
teacher:Its a problem like this okay,1
teacher:Since the fact is the mother okay,1
teacher:start at right,1
teacher:Feels better so um that night um they gave a toast right,1
teacher:So its greatly decreased right,1
teacher:Now then the mother um after this okay,1
teacher:Since he had less she poured some for him okay,1
teacher:Do you agree with that,2

teacher:Okay I see some people are  shaking their heads and I want to hear why,2
teacher:Oh a three would go right here do we agree;student:53,2

teacher:Yup did he get it;student:Times ten what,2
teacher:So hows Ariel doing this;student:The number is ten,2
teacher:Why does  he think that,2
teacher:Does everyone agree;student:Its going to go six to twentyfour,2
teacher:Yeah does everybody agree on that;student:Seven,2
teacher:which way did you like it best;student:Basically the same,2
teacher:How is Milin s chart different than;student:Is it,2

teacher:My goodness what do you think about this James;student:Three thousand seven hundred and fiftyone,2
teacher:Do you think there is anything that is same with what you are doing and  what James came up with;student:I just noticed that twentyfive times three is seventyfive thats how I  solved this real quick,2
teacher:What do you think David,2
teacher:Jessica has a  question for you David,2
teacher:Are you all convinced,2
teacher:But the important thing is there is only one right answer and what you ought to try to think about is if someone else is thinking about it differently than you are how do you connect your thinking,2
teacher:Other ways of seeing it,2
teacher:Are there other points of view on this;student:for a week,2
teacher:Does that make sense to you;student:Cause I mean I think I was,2

teacher:Can you can you help him understand that;student:Well I obviously if the calculator,2
teacher:T1  Do you agree with him;student:You think we should put the  parentheses here,2
teacher:But conventionally do you think this is the way how everybody  interprets,2
teacher:Do you all agree;student:That s what you want I think,2
teacher:Yes any other comments about this Franc;student:Yes and over there it doesnt show a fraction it just shows its divided by five,2
teacher:Ethan what do you think about that one,2
teacher:Do you see how he got that one Julian,2

teacher:Did anybody find her mistake as we were going through,2
teacher:Austin do you agree disagree or not;student:81,2

teacher:Okay did you have any kind of different strategy;student:I agree,2
teacher:Yes Maggie do you agree disagree or have a question;student:I think that it is 4 because there is nine total numbers of data and we need to have four numbers on each side you have to put a box here circle on,2

teacher:Did anybody do this differently,2
teacher:Does everyone agree with Ashton;student:46,2

teacher:And when you  think you have an answer why don t you discuss it with your  partner and see that your partner agrees with you,2
teacher:How many of you agree,2
teacher:You all agree,2
teacher:And when you  think you have an answer why don t you discuss it with your  partner and see that your partner agrees with you,2
teacher:How many of you agree,2
teacher:You all agree;student:And if if this  is one half of it it d be well if orange is two  you would make this  into a one,2
teacher:So do you  all agree with that,2
teacher:Do you all agree with that,2
teacher:How many of you agree with Laura,2
teacher:How  many of you agree with that,2
teacher:You can sort of discuss it with her see  if you agree,2

teacher:You agree to that right;student:Yeah,2
teacher:How many of you agree that it goes on and on;student:On and on,2

teacher:Would you agree to that,2
teacher:Did you come up with the  same names for that,2
teacher:How many of you agree that if we call the yellow and the  green one two,2

teacher:You agree that when we call  it one that this is a fourth,2
teacher:No,2
teacher:Now there are some hands that arent up does that  mean that you disagree or you re not sure,2
teacher:You agree;student:I agree,2
teacher:How many of you don t know how many of  you agree how many of you disagree,2
teacher:Do you disagree with her argument,2
teacher:How many of you agree with the argument that  Audra just gave us,2
teacher:How many of you agree with that argument for calling the  red one fourth when the yellow and the green  together  are one;student:And if we put  the reds up against it we would all call it one fourth so we  thought if we called the yellow and the green one it would  be the same thing as the brown,2
teacher:How many of you agree with that;student:One fourth,2
teacher:How many of you  agree with that,2
teacher:Would you raise your hands if you agree with the argument  that Sarah and Audra and Erik gave us;student:Yeah because see if the brown and the yellow and green  theyre equal and theyre both  called one and four of the reds  equal up to one therefore that they d have to be fourths  because there are four parts theyre fourths,2
teacher:Do you agree with that;student:Yeah,2
teacher:What do you think Laura;student:It looks like a third,2
teacher:What don t you like;student:No,2
teacher:Alan did you want to add something;student:And then whatever rod you get divide two from that and keep going  down,2
teacher:I hear uh some of you  whispering that before Alan had a theory and Erik had a theory what  do you think of Andrew s theory,2
teacher:Raise your hand if you ve built this  model,2
teacher:How many of you built this one,2
teacher:The new model,2
teacher:Does that model does it give you that  same answer,2
teacher:What do you think class;student:A fourth,2
teacher:Does it make sense what Michael is saying,2
teacher:Brian did you have that one,2
teacher:Did anyone do the model  that Danielle and Gregory are building,2
teacher:How did she get the other name for that,2
teacher:One quarter and you see how she got the other name for that;student:One quarter,2
teacher:What do you think of Meredith s  question have you changed your mind now to the answer given  Meredith s question,2
teacher:What do you think  about what Meredith said,2
teacher:Their proposal was that its closest to 12 do you agree do you disagree or do you have a question,2
teacher:Given Meredith said the question was  which is bigger and by how much,2
teacher:Did anyone else  build Danielle and Gregory s model,2
teacher:Even if she is going between zero and two I want to know if she were going between zero and two should onequarter go someplace else or not,2
teacher:Anyone else think of it that way;student:Umhum,2
teacher:How many of you think that is where you would put a negative one;student:Like right there,2
teacher:How many of you like where Laura places onequarter,2
teacher:What do you think;student:I don t know,2
teacher:What do you think,2
teacher:You all like that;student:Yeah,2
teacher:What do you think,2
teacher:Are you all a little happier now with where Gregory placed one half,2
teacher:Do you have any  editorial comments on this discussion,2
teacher:How many of you agree that that is where you would place three,2
teacher:Gregory what do you think about all this dust bugs and things that big;student:I was going to say what Brain said that it could be as big as a dust bug and just,2
teacher:That is Michaels question what do you think,2
teacher:With whom;student:I really do agree with them because,2
teacher:Do you have an opinion,2
teacher:You are listening to this  very carefully what is your opinion on this,2
teacher:How many of you think that;student:I think that all numbers to the left of zero would be in the negative and all numbers to the  right of zero would be in the positive,2
teacher:What do you think;student:Yeah,2
teacher:Audra are you agreeing or arent sure,2
teacher:Comment;student:I dont really have a question,2
teacher:How may of you agree they  weren t the same size,2
teacher:Then I could call  this half a candy bar agreed,2
teacher:You all agree with that if I  call this one,2
teacher:Would you put up your hand if you think he is right;student:Good question,2
teacher:And you agree that it works;student:Yeah I did,2
teacher:It pays to have and you agree that it works,2
teacher:Has anybody checked that;student:Okay hum four,2
teacher:Check four for this and see if it works;student:It s four,2
teacher:Is that alright,2
teacher:Everyone agrees with that,2
teacher:Hum do you think that;student:Bobby is right,2
teacher:Did everybody agree with this for that third problem,2
teacher:Is that right;student:Yeah,2
teacher:What do you think of that;student:s I agree,2
teacher:What do you think of that;student:One side of this and two sides of  this both are one half,2
teacher:How many of you like that,2
teacher:What do you think;student:I like it,2
teacher:What do the rest of  you think of that,2
teacher:Is that helpful to you what hes  done,2
teacher:Everybody agrees with that,2
teacher:How many of you agree with that,2
teacher:Has anybody checked that,2
teacher:Would people check this out;student:I ll try my old one,2
teacher:That A was going to win,2
teacher:Anybody else think that;student:I thought A was gonna win cause it has more numbers than player B,2
teacher:How many of you thought something else,2
teacher:You want to help Sarah understand;student:Oh OK I messed up,2
teacher:See if Milin agrees with you;student:Oh 1 ok 1,2
teacher:Well that s probably enough but she went down and did that and you agree that that s what we were doing;student:Should I do more,2
teacher:Isn t that true a lot of people have decided on that,2
teacher:Anybody check that yet,2
teacher:Yup do you agree;student:So these two have to be the same,2
teacher:You saw where he got the two,2
teacher:He said he s  going to start with box times two and I take it everybody agrees   with that isn t that right,2
teacher:Everybody agree with that;student:I don t understand this this makes no sense,2
teacher:Are they right or not right,2
teacher:Would someone check eight and someone check thirteen,2
teacher:Who is going to check five to make sure it works,2
teacher:Uh would people check these out,2
teacher:OK is everybody happy with that,2
teacher:What part of what Erik said;student:Um I agree with Erik,2
teacher:David what do you think;student:So in the next model,2
teacher:Do the rest of you see that,2
teacher:The rest of you agree with that;student:Yeah,2
teacher:And what did what was how did she make her train;student:Yeah Sarah just built another model that uses the exact same  length as the other one,2
teacher:How many of you did that too,2
teacher:Raise your hand if you found the same model,2
teacher:How many of you found that same model when you  worked it out,2
teacher:How many of you agree with  that model,2
teacher:How many of you agree with that;student:So thats why we think its one twelfth,2
teacher:So so then ok Ill buy that how  many of you buy that argument,2
teacher:Do we agree on that,2
teacher:How many of you agree;student:The person who got a half,2
teacher:How  many,2
teacher:How many of these little chunks she would get,2
teacher:Okay so if I  cut it in half do you see how many pieces she would get  here;student:And you would need to have four so I could cut it in half,2
teacher:Why not  Graham,2
teacher:Why couldn t she do that,2
teacher:Why wouldn t she cut it long ways for  a half very easily,2
teacher:You all agree  with that you all understand that,2
teacher:Jessica is that reasonable to you,2
teacher:You think that too,2
teacher:Did you make it too Michael,2
teacher:Sarah what do you  think,2
teacher:Did anyone else come up with that same model;student:Yeah,2
teacher:You came up with the same model didnt you;student:I guess I agree with it its what I came up with,2
teacher:What do you think about that Michael;student:One twelfth,2
teacher:Andrew and Jessica what do you  think,2
teacher:Andrew what do you think;student:Right it would either take one,2
teacher:How many of you agree with what they said;student:Mmm hmmm,2

teacher:Are you convinced Kelly and Graham;student:Yeah,2
teacher:Raise your hand if youre convinced how many,2
teacher:How many of you are convinced how many are  up there,2
teacher:How many of you are convinced that with the  model that Alan and Erik have up on the overhead how many of  you are convinced of the number of white cubes there,2
teacher:Is that what you  had,2
teacher:Do you all agree with that,2
teacher:Will you go help Will you go help Caroline,2
teacher:Who did you side with;student:Sadie,2

teacher:I would like you to discuss with your partner and compare your work,2
teacher:When anyone was explaining this to their partner did they use the words vertical and horizontal;student:Those both lineup so thats how you know its 24 by 14,2
teacher:Agree;student:Then there are 15 overall squares,2
teacher:Do we agree;student:I think its true because in the place value of the hundredth place value theres a zero and in the other one the hundredths place value theres a five,2
teacher:Agree,2
teacher:Charlie comment,2
teacher:Agree;student:True,2
teacher:Agree;student:False,2
teacher:Agree;student:False,2
teacher:Do we agree with that;student:My partner said that first she split into halves and then she colored one half inside and then she split it into thirds six and then she colored two thirds and then she got 26,2
teacher:Agree;student:A product is the answer for multiplication,2
teacher:Agree,2
teacher:12 agree;student:How I found the denominator is I covered up the numerators and then I just multiplied both denominators by 4 and 3 and then I got 12,2

teacher:24 agree;student:24,2
teacher:Agree,2
teacher:You guys agreed,2
teacher:Comment Emily;student:Me and Liam saw 23 was closest we saw  and then we saw that seven and six was closest to eight so we did 2  8 is 10 and then we added it down here which was nine nines,2
teacher:Agreed;student:15 and one tenth,2
teacher:Claire why do you agree,2
teacher:Im not seeing everyones agree so that means some people have a comment,2

teacher:Youre thinking of stars for Adelle what did she do well,2
teacher:Greater than,2
teacher:Agree;student:I think it is greater than 45 x 9 because you re basically just doing 45 x 9 and we know the answer to it but then youre adding to it so its going to be greater than 45 x 9,2
teacher:Did anyone else notice that,2
teacher:Is your answers similar on number three,2
teacher:Does your line look the same,2
teacher:Did you want to add something,2
teacher:Whats the problem that hes explaining friends,2
teacher:Check with your teammates,2
teacher:Portia what do you think,2
teacher:What do you think Portia,2
teacher:Can you repeat that oneKayla,2
teacher:Is that where you noticed it Hannah,2
teacher:What do you think up front;student:It s the only way it could be bigger  by,2
teacher:Is it okay like that,2
teacher:Oh we have some disagreement what s  your disagreement,2
teacher:Does anybody want to add to that,2
teacher:Michael do you want to add to that,2
teacher:Let s talk about this a little bit  more to help them,2
teacher:Can someone help,2
teacher:How many of you are still not sure,2
teacher:How many of  you disagree,2
teacher:How many of you agree with  what Meredith said,2
teacher:Does anybody want to add to that;student:Yes,2
teacher:What do the rest of you think;student:Well if you have the same question asked and you do it right  then youre going to wind up with the same answer and some  of the models could be bigger and some of them could be  smaller,2
teacher:Would you  all make the same model,2
teacher:Ok Is there anyone who disagrees with that;student:Um hmm,2
teacher:You all agree with that,2
teacher:Do you agree,2
teacher:What do you think about that;student:So there will always be one fourth and two fourths three  fourths four fourths and two fourths is always going to be a  half a half in fourths,2
teacher:To answer that question;student:No,2
teacher:Did you all build the same  model,2
teacher:Now what does that have to  do with the models you made and some of the comments that  Michael and Erik made about the models you made,2
teacher:What part of what Erik said;student:Um I agree with Erik,2
teacher:How many of you built a second model that  looks like that model up there that Meredith is fiddling with,2

teacher:Do you all agree with that that we could   what do you think,2
teacher:What do you all think about that,2
teacher:How many of you have a model that looks like that,2
teacher:So are all of these  true statements,2
teacher:Do you all agree to that,2
teacher:Are there two answers;student:Theres two answers,2
teacher:So so what is Meredith saying here,2
teacher:Is that true,2
teacher:Do you all  agree that one white has a the number name for the white  rod is one twelfth,2
teacher:Shes calling one white one sixth;student:Yeah she said,2
teacher:What do you think about that;student:Two twelfths,2
teacher:All those things are they true;student:Yeah,2
teacher:Or are you just agreeing at  this point,2

teacher:Is that interesting,2
teacher:Is that what you had,2
teacher:Did you make it too Michael,2

teacher:So so then ok Ill buy  that how many of you buy that argument,2
teacher:The rest of you agree with that;student:Yeah,2
teacher:And what did what was how did she make her train;student:Yeah Sarah just built another model that uses the exact  same length as the other one,2
teacher:How many of you are convinced that  with the model that Alan and Erik have up on the overhead  how many of you are convinced of the number of white  cubes there,2
teacher:How many of you did that too,2
teacher:You  might want to talk to your partner about your argument and  see if your partner buys it,2
teacher:Raise your hand if you found the  same model,2
teacher:How many of you found that same model  when you worked it out,2
teacher:How many of you agree  with that model,2
teacher:How many of you agree with that;student:So thats why we think its one twelfth,2
teacher:Are you all convinced;student:Let me show  here,2
teacher:Graham you can come and help,2
teacher:Ok well let you guys go first and Erik is listening  to see if he agrees,2
teacher:David what do you think;student:So in the next model,2
teacher:How many of  you are convinced how many are up there,2
teacher:Ok do you  believe there are  Sarah and Beth,2
teacher:Sarah what do you think,2
teacher:You sure you dont want to ask  them any of that,2

teacher:Then is there anybody who says they also formed equations like this,2
teacher:Compared to what he just said now okay,2
teacher:Are there people who also tried it using this method,2
teacher:How about other people,2
teacher:People with the same method as this,2
teacher:People who can say they also got equations like this,2
teacher:Are there any other methods,2

teacher:How many of you disagree,2
teacher:How many of you agree with what  Meredith said,2
teacher:What do the rest of you think;student:Well if you have the same question asked and you do it right then  youre going to wind up with the same answer and some of the  models could be bigger and some of them could be smaller,2
teacher:You agree with that that there are certain things that all  of you would have in your model;student:Um hmm,2
teacher:You all agree with that,2
teacher:Does anybody want to add to that,2

teacher:Did you all do that;student:Um two thirds is two purples,2
teacher:How many of you have a model that looks  like that,2
teacher:How many of you  built a second model that looks like that model up there that  Meredith is fiddling with,2

teacher:10 8;student:10 8,3
teacher:10;student:10,3
teacher:School to the grocery store;student:School to the grocery store,3
teacher:Six square feet;student:I got six square feet,3
teacher:Nine yards of yarn;student:Nine yards of yarn,3
teacher:56 4;student:I did 56 4,3
teacher:Evan;student:Evan,3
teacher:2 10;student:2 10,3
teacher:6 times;student:6 times,3
teacher:Five;student:Five,3
teacher:Two;student:Two,3
teacher:They weren t the same size;student:Cause they re weren t the same size chocolate bar,3
teacher:Two and three;student:Two and three,3
teacher:Two;student:A little bit past the two,3
teacher:One and one half;student:One and one half,3
teacher:You see a six;student:You see a six,3
teacher:It ends;student:It ends,3
teacher:Cause there s three of them;student:Cause there s three of them,3
teacher:It ends,3
teacher:Integers;student:Integers,3
teacher:It would take a long time;student:It would take a long time,3
teacher:It never stops,3
teacher:Orange and red;student:Orange and red,3
teacher:The white;student:The white,3
teacher:One sixth;student:One sixth,3
teacher:Integers;student:Integers,3
teacher:Thirty;student:Thirty,3
teacher:The guy with one third;student:The guy with one third,3
teacher:No;student:No,3
teacher:Three;student:Three,3
teacher:For number six;student:We ve got one for number six,3
teacher:Negative twentysix;student:Negative twentysix,3
teacher:Five;student:Five,3
teacher:Two;student:Two,3
teacher:No;student:No,3
teacher:Which thing is bigger;student:Which thing is bigger,3
teacher:Four;student:How about four,3
teacher:No its just staying flat so thats down here;student:No,4
teacher:Thats true could be like a very smSS amount per kilometer;student:It could be you get 5 if youre looking at every 10 kilometers you get one cent because  dont see it,4
teacher:Yes because one cap is 5;student:Yes,4
teacher:No its going down by different amounts and then down by 5 here;student:No,4
teacher:20 secondsI want you to think about what this means;student:20 seconds,4
teacher:50 seconds because two meters per second takes 50 seconds to go 100;student:50 seconds,4
teacher:This is not reSSy a ratio table;student:Is that the ratio table,4
teacher:Okay I want you to write that in 225 meters per second thats pretty clear from the equation;student:225 meters per second,4
teacher:Yes 19 because it goes 19 17 15 13;student:Not 19,4
teacher:Sure but normSSy it would be Y x 23 X because its this times 23 is that one;student:Can you turn X 23 equals to,4
teacher:Yes but thats just loosing 12 per week;student:Minus 12 times W,4
teacher:One second is 15 meters;student:15,4
teacher:2 were going to write these in;student:2,4
teacher:Thats true as long as time is going up by a steady amount,4
teacher:By 1 so youre going to write 1 five times;student:1,4
teacher:No its 10 times 4;student:No,4
teacher:Definitely not;student:No,4
teacher:No and you might notice I saw some people continue to graph just like I did it makes this like Ushape;student:No,4
teacher:It might because some of the patterns get kind of tricky to see especially like four and three;student:Are there any questions like the one youre showing right now could be a four question,4
teacher:Thats one it has two square roots so It could be 3 or 3;student:Is that true the square root of 9 is 3,4
teacher:Yes its going to be this flat line right here;student:Yes,4
teacher:10 meters per second is like Usain Bolt,4
teacher:Distance 15 x time,4
teacher:No so its not linear;student:No,4
teacher:it gives you the Yintercept right there;student:It just gives the Yintercept,4
teacher:I think 12 is easy because then when you make your graph it just goes down;student:Can you go up by either 10 or 12,4
teacher:Thats two and notice thats why we needed that 7 to be there instead of the 6;student:2,4
teacher:Plus 3;student:3,4
teacher:Unless youre faster;student:We were a lot faster,4
teacher:Y3X for the slope 1 for the Yintercept;student:Y3X1,4
teacher:3 so your slope is 3 because its going up by 3 every time;student:3,4
teacher:Up by 6 so same ratio still linear;student:6,4
teacher:Up goes up by 6;student:Up by 6,4
teacher:No not in the table so were going to need to find that after we figure out the slope;student:No,4
teacher:Y3X4 you can flip it around;student:3x4,4
teacher:You should write the 1s;student:Do you have to do the 1s,4
teacher:Goes up by three;student:Three,4
teacher:The reason why I use this is because in the question it said use M for money and W for weeks but in my honest opinion if you use X and Y instead of the letters thats fine;student:Yes I like to put X in sometimes,4
teacher:That would not be correct;student:On line C is it okay if I wrote Y X  5 or is that not correct,4
teacher:Yes but I certainly agree because its proportional and its linear;student:Its also linear,4
teacher:You should always have the Y equals part;student:For number two or Y and B in the equation do I have to write Y equals,4
teacher:14 yes;student:14,4
teacher:It is 14 okay;student:14,4
teacher:Is not 26 but youre close as well;student:Is it 26,4
teacher:4 okay;student:4,4
teacher:is;student:Yes,4
teacher:No not a solution;student:No,4
teacher:Yes you could write it like this Y 3  12X;student:Could you also put the three in front,4
teacher:Sure you could do this 3  12X;student:You could do this 3  12,4
teacher:Id say times 12 per week;student:Or times a week by 12,4
teacher:Close 25 seconds;student:25,4
teacher:Youre talking about mode a little bit;student:Bob has a much better mode than he does and,4
teacher:Itd be like this slightly faster;student:It would be more steep because the number is  distance she walks faster,4
teacher:Two and then three three three and a four at the bottom;student:Two,4
teacher:Maybe he takes his time;student:I think Ben is better because even though he got less that means he takes his time more,4
teacher:Eight minus one gets you seven;student:Seven,4
teacher:Theres four fours and an eight;student:Four,4
teacher:Two three;student:Two,4
teacher:Six is your mean;student:Six,4
teacher:Yes you could do 12 but six is also their least common multiple;student:I first find the common denominator of 12 and then I  fraction,4
teacher:Youre correct1 28   18 you got that;student:I was saying 1 28,4
teacher:Yes and divide it into groups that are the size of 18 because we want to see how many groups of 18 go in this;student:And divide it in between them,4
teacher:We use area models when we multiply;student:Like a model,4
teacher:16 12 youve got it;student:16 12,4
teacher:Its not on home work;student:Home work,4
teacher:8 and 724s is my final answer here okay,4
teacher:I took away 1624s too much so Im going to add that back;student:Sixteen,4
teacher:Yes 24;student:Twentyfour,4
teacher:1515s;student:1515,4
teacher:Fifteen youre right;student:Fifteen,4
teacher:Eight Plus 96 is the same as one and 36,4
teacher:We have 33 and 536,4
teacher:9 times 4 is 36;student:Four,4
teacher:Decreasing so we are going to have a negative slope;student:Decreasing,4
teacher:The only common factor is one so were done and we can either multiply 3 times 12 or 9 times 4 but either way Chris you were right on,4
teacher:Yes in decimals or you do it in fractions,4
teacher:We can start finding the mean yes if you havent already;student:Can we start finding the mean,4
teacher:33 13 seconds;student:33333,4
teacher:One and three;student:Three,4
teacher:Were not going to make a line pop for this one;student:Make a line pop,4
teacher:Dont just assume that theyre all going to be plus three,4
teacher:You dont need to make a graph;student:You can easily notice that just by looking at it,4
teacher:Depending on the other one so like and the reason why distance depends on time is because if youre someone whos walking how far you go depends on how long you decide to walk for;student:Dependent as in like depending,4
teacher:Five so its not consistent;student:Five,4
teacher:No okay and well just go step by step;student:No,4
teacher:No so one way we could talk about it is like this shape is a distorted version of this shape or this shape is a distorted version of this shape;student:No,4
teacher:Yes that will be Zug;student:Its Zug,4
teacher:I think no because this is almost a 90degree angle and if you take that away from this angle you get back to really small angles;student:No,4
teacher:No definitely not so this one is also distorted;student:No,4
teacher:Yes it looks like that;student:Then it looks like lug,4
teacher:Okay 3XY;student:3XY,4
teacher:Yes this figure;student:Yes,4
teacher:It should be four shapes;student:Four,4
teacher:Yes it s doubled;student:It s like double the shape,4
teacher:Just positives and negatives because in general it s like quadrant one could be any of the points over here;student:Will you increase the numbers in that quadrant thing or you will just go straight because its positives,4
teacher:Okay so you think Seth because he has the biggest mean and median;student:I think Seth because he has the biggest mean and median,4
teacher:Yes so I would say that bless you;student:Yes,4
teacher:Yes it evens out we take these four and move them right there and we get four;student:I said its four,4
teacher:Yes I can just tell we Shannon way more boxes than we did for Bens and for Bobs;student:Yes,4
teacher:Yes its like significantly higher;student:Yes,4
teacher:Its just four;student:Just four,4
teacher:Its four its in between these two fours;student:Four,4
teacher:Three so Seth has the smallest range out of everyone;student:Three,4
teacher:Yes because 25 is bigger than two and two over here;student:Yes,4
teacher:You cant find the Yintercept just from this graph that we have,4
teacher:One place right;student:One,4
teacher:I add 3 so 12 15 18 21;student:3,4
teacher:Yes youre going to make an estimate;student:Make an estimate,4
teacher:Now we need to get to the nine so we can add one;student:You can add one and 48,4
teacher:Smallest number;student:Smallest,4
teacher:048 is a different number than I see;student:The number model is 9048,4
teacher:Let me just do You can just do 97 and youre done,4
teacher:Dont tell me scoot it;student:Ill scoot it up to the bottom,4
teacher:Yeah its seven hundredths;student:Hundredths,4
teacher:Im looking for specifics I want you guys to be exact;student:Youre looking for specific,4
teacher:Thousands place;student:Thousands,4
teacher:Yes because the coordinate grid is bigger thank you Vicki;student:No because this ones bigger,4
teacher:No were going to plot it right on the same grid;student:I was plotting them up here,4
teacher:Width love that;student:Width,4
teacher:Yes to come up with or make and so in this context we used that word yesterday;student:To come up with or make,4
teacher:Enlarge would be the interesting word and thats why we highlighted it;student:Enlarge,4
teacher:The answer would be no its exactly double,4
teacher:Dividing by two is the same as multiplying by half so the answer is yes about this much,4
teacher:Yes so youre doubling it;student:By two,4
teacher:Okay so the math site is really helpful;student:Maybe going to the math site,4
teacher:Its twice as tall;student:It is two times,4
teacher:Shorter;student:Its not tall,4
teacher:Or an estimate;student:An estimate,4
teacher:Its going to be two times bigger because youre doubling all the original numbers;student:Two times bigger,4
teacher:Horizontal awesome;student:Horizontal,4
teacher:Yes your answer is close;student:Your estimate is close to,4
teacher:Okay its eight and one;student:Eight and one,4
teacher:The accounting up strategy;student:Accounting up strategy,4
teacher:aligned them;student:Aligned,4
teacher:Yes so its going to be 10 out of 30 parts are going to be shaded;student:30 because 6  5 is 30,4
teacher:Yes we could round down 58;student:Then you could like round it down,4
teacher:This would be 13 of the 35;student:Then you find the 23 or 35 then you shade all of it between 13 and 35,4
teacher:First we divide the square into thirds the whole into thirds,4
teacher:Guys when you are asked to explain rounding listen up,4
teacher:The answer is no;student:No,4
teacher:50086 and youre going to round it to the nearest whole number;student:50086,4
teacher:1400s;student:1400,4
teacher:You look at the place value to the right;student:On the digit after the value to the right,4
teacher:Fourth theyre fourths;student:One fourth,4
teacher:One times one equals one;student:One,4
teacher:Four ninths;student:Ninths,4
teacher:Yes one of the sides;student:One of the sides,4
teacher:The numbers that you multiply by each other to get a product;student:The numbers that you can multiply them by each other to make a product,4
teacher:To match the fraction multiplication;student:To match it,4
teacher:Okay so you can use this to solve problems;student:So you can use that to solve problems,4
teacher:To find the area;student:How to find area,4
teacher:Three sets of four coins,4
teacher:This is two times three;student:Threefifths is three times as much as onefifth and two times three,4
teacher:Yes multiplying fractions;student:Multiplication,4
teacher:She said five times two is 10 so onefifth will be two,4
teacher:You will add it;student:Add,4
teacher:To the next dollar;student:I started with 1219 and I added 081 to make it just dollars,4
teacher:You had add 13;student:I did  so what I did was I added  to get 13 then I added the  to get 5 then I added 1,4
teacher:9 because its a decreasing line;student:9,4
teacher:The other sailboats the other grids that are on page 135 have different ranges on depth so you guys are going to be making some different sailboats;student:The others are 16 by 12,4
teacher:So if you started with the number two and you multiplied by two the multiplication by two would be the rule that youre applying;student:For example in and out you have a rule of  like if you do times two or whatever,4
teacher:Yes that works;student:Yes,4
teacher:3X  3 is three pouches and three coins equals 2X  12 two pouches and 12 coins;student:3X  3  2X  12,4
teacher:18 plus 12 is 30;student:18,4
teacher:nine coins;student:Nine,4
teacher:Yes same exact thing;student:Yes,4
teacher:Lets do the steps;student:I was going to do the steps,4
teacher:Notice how X  1  30 is like one of these groups and Oliver I like how you said three times the quantity of because that shows that its in parenthesis and that would equal 30;student:In these ones the quantity of X  1  30,4
teacher:Its really two sections of a pouch and two coins;student:Its two,4
teacher:12 okay;student:12,4
teacher:Sure you can do the equation;student:Can I do the equation,4
teacher:Theres eight leftover;student:Then 8  2 because theres 2 bags,4
teacher:Two so were going to write 2X;student:Two,4
teacher:Yes its 13;student:Is it 13,4
teacher:2 and then I triple it I get 6;student:2,4
teacher:46  2  23;student:23,4
teacher:Its fine if you just wrote 5 for that one;student:I got 5,4
teacher:18 so if you got your slope right then it should work out perfectly;student:18,4
teacher:15;student:15,4
teacher:3;student:3,4
teacher:7 were going to go to 7;student:7,4
teacher:This is not a ratio table because its not proportional;student:Is this a ratio table,4
teacher:21 3X sure;student:Y  21 3X,4
teacher:If youre 7 away and youre jumping by threes every time its 7 x 3,4
teacher:Three times the quantity of X  1,4
teacher:Its a 12 by 12 all right;student:Its 12 by 12,4
teacher:They need to be positive;student:Do the whole numbers 1 through 9 need to be positive or it can be negative,4
teacher:The answer has nothing to do with 1 through 9;student:Does it have to be in between 1 and 9,4
teacher:Adding a problem like that;student:Adding a rule into a problem,4
teacher:Yes okay;student:Yes,4
teacher:You dont need three but there might be three;student:You dont need three,4
teacher:You are definitely allowed to use diagonal lines;student:Are we allowed to do diagonal lines,4
teacher:Youre going to have to have two other vertices but those two have to be part of your square;student:You can have other vertices right,4
teacher:This is not your homework;student:For homework,4
teacher:Five blocks north because youre going up;student:North,4
teacher:Yes its three;student:Three,4
teacher:Youre right police station,4
teacher:4 4 okay;student:The gas station is 4 4,4
teacher:Take away one x and you get 3x  9;student:You take away an X on both sides,4
teacher:If you do 12   5 you should get 110;student:Positive,4
teacher:Positive and then you just multiply your numbers and you get a 34;student:Positive,4
teacher:If you subtract a negative you really add them;student:Because if you subtract negative from a negative youre supposed to add them,4
teacher:It is not 2;student:Negative one and fivefifths or 2,4
teacher:075 positive 075;student:075,4
teacher:It is not 125;student:Is it 125,4
teacher:It is not negative two;student:Negative two,4
teacher:It goes to negative nine so you start at negative five and you go further into the negatives so negative nine;student:Since this is in the negatives its going backward and then it goes to negative nine,4
teacher:Nine minus two is seven,4
teacher:You can not repeat numbers;student:You cannot repeat,4
teacher:Yes you just take it away because this is saying the opposite of X equals 25;student:You just take it away,4
teacher:So 1x plus 2 equals nine;student:I put in 1x plus 2 equals 9,4
teacher:Whole numbers are positive,4
teacher:Its close to 50 cents;student:50,4
teacher:Absolutely not;student:No,4
teacher:Okay because 12 and then 58 is close to 12 so we know that thats one;student:Plus 18,4
teacher:Decimal nice job;student:Decimal,4
teacher:So this is my hundredths place and then you said put the zero the point and the zero;student:In the hundredths,4
teacher:Yes 2100;student:2100,4
teacher:In the 10 and then I fill in my decimal;student:In the 10,4
teacher:column exactly;student:Column,4
teacher:45 okay;student:45,4
teacher:Yes okay;student:Yes,4
teacher:45 okay;student:45,4
teacher:Okay 55 15;student:55 15,4
teacher:Four;student:Four,4
teacher:80100;student:20100,4
teacher:Theyre still fourths;student:Fourths,4
teacher:34 interesting;student:34,4
teacher:Four okay;student:Four,4
teacher:Add and Subtract,4
teacher:A piece of a whole absolutely;student:A piece of a whole,4
teacher:4312;student:43,4
teacher:The denominator is four;student:Four,4
teacher:I see 12,4
teacher:nan;student:Teen,4
teacher:She just said four and seeing if they have,4
teacher:Its true the snake would eat the fish and then that wouldnt make sense;student:The snake will eat the fish,4
teacher:34 absolutely interesting;student:34,4
teacher:Eight too;student:The eight,4
teacher:Zero all right;student:The zero,4
teacher:Interesting 80100 looks a whole lot like 0 and 80100 or sounds like it;student:0 and 80100,4
teacher:Four steps;student:Four,4
teacher:Because my total is 1926 and Im trying to figure out how many miles did each of those six boys run;student:1926 by 6,4
teacher:Yes how many miles each boy ran;student:How many miles they ran,4
teacher:Six boys absolutely;student:Six boys,4
teacher:Yes so whichever way you like you can solve it that way;student:Yes,4
teacher:So theyre like two sums because the answer to my whole number addition was three the answer to my fraction addition was 34 so altogether 3 34;student:3 34 because those are the two products,4
teacher:Okay so you took out the whole numbers two and one and you said 21;student:First I did  the whole numbers,4
teacher:Four;student:I mean four,4
teacher:Now I know that the whole number in my answer is three;student:Three,4
teacher:Three fifths;student:Five,4
teacher:In all is going to mean that were going to add okay;student:In all means were going to add,4
teacher:Whole numbers;student:Numbers,4
teacher:Adding mixed numbers so were going to be adding numbers that have Its going the wrong way its going to my other here;student:Adding mixed numbers,4
teacher:One whole awesome;student:One whole,4
teacher:I do yes;student:Yes,4
teacher:Bigger so the top number is bigger than the bottom than the denominator;student:Bigger,4
teacher:Yes the top so you know that yourself;student:No the top,4
teacher:Yes you can put equal;student:Do you put equal on both,4
teacher:Out of four pieces I ate four so 44;student:Four,4
teacher:No 14 would be one of these pizzas but I ate all of them;student:14,4
teacher:One okay;student:One,4
teacher:I ate two whole pizzas;student:Two,4
teacher:I didnt eat 24 of a pizza I ate 2 14 of a pizza;student:24,4
teacher:Okay animals;student:Theyre animals,4
teacher:Oh pets;student:Five pets in all,4
teacher:One half so one out of two;student:One,4
teacher:Four greens and it equals the same as 23;student:Four,4
teacher:Yes it shows numbers;student:It shows numbers on there,4
teacher:55 and its square units we dont know,4
teacher:Well we cant quite solve yet;student:Solve,4
teacher:Same thing;student:Same,4
teacher:17 thats what our total should be,4
teacher:Its 11;student:6  5  11,4
teacher:We know that the square is five long right here;student:We know  square five,4
teacher:Its actually not a graph;student:A graph,4
teacher:Its five;student:Five,4
teacher:Base times height divided by two;student:Base equals  divided by two,4
teacher:Yes your lateral faces like on this one theyre not parallel because theyre touching at the top at the apex,4
teacher:Prism which is a square because this one has the base is like this;student:Prism,4
teacher:Theyre all triangles so that is the difference;student:Triangles,4
teacher:Its where two faces intersect;student:Where two lines intersect,4
teacher:The flat surface so its not just necessarily the front;student:A face is the flat surface of a polyhedron,4
teacher:Its surface;student:Its surface,4
teacher:The area of each of the surfaces surface area;student:Its the area around like the outside of it,4
teacher:Miles traveled total;student:Id have the Miles traveled,4
teacher:We need to label them;student:The labels,4
teacher:40   total miles  hours;student:40M,4
teacher:Its not miles per hour;student:Miles per hour is dependent,4
teacher:Yes so no thats total calories;student:Calories burned on the elliptical,4
teacher:No specific and clear is specific and clear;student:Because its clear,4
teacher:Zero so on your number line I want everyone to write a zero;student:With Zero,4
teacher:Three so thats my dividing 19   6 is 3;student:Three,4
teacher:Yes on your fifths;student:On the fifth,4
teacher:Fivefifths or one whole;student:One whole,4
teacher:If this is my whole and I need 23 you guys already told me what shape my thirds are they are my rhombus,4
teacher:Im hearing that theres equal parts that people share;student:Its something divided into a whole and I feel like its so we could measure it  Each person get equal parts like if somebody gets 14 theres three more people that could share that,4
teacher:Yes or one whole;student:One whole,4
teacher:Zero or zerotwelfths;student:Zero,4
teacher:Another three;student:Three,4
teacher:Later on in this unit were going to be given a number line and youre going to have to fill it in so if youre just given a blank number line you would have to figure in zero one two three four five six,4
teacher:Yes they only gave us three lines but you guys just told me that this is zerosixths and this is Sixsixths;student:Three,4
teacher:Zerosixth absolutely;student:Zerosixth,4
teacher:Yes its at the beginning absolutely;student:Because at the beginning,4
teacher:Fourfifths equals eighttenths,4
teacher:Fivefifths is equal to tentenths;student:Five and its tentenths,4
teacher:Six tenths absolutely so threefifths is equal to sixtenths;student:Sixtenths,4
teacher:Four okay so lets look one two three four;student:Four,4
teacher:Two okay so lets break this up into two;student:Two,4
teacher:My green are my fifths;student:Green,4
teacher:Whoa so I noticed that Barbara is grabbing from that knowledge that she learned two days ago with the circles so if you draw it as a circle 10 equal the same;student:If you draw a circle and it fits and you fill it too and if you put four and put I dont know put 10 and put eight,4
teacher:and fourtenths;student:Fourtenths,4
teacher:She found twofifths;student:Two fives and fourtenths,4
teacher:On the tenths;student:On that tenths,4
teacher:10 interesting,4
teacher:10 tenths because 10 tenths is the same thing as saying one whole;student:10 tenths,4
teacher:Zero because I have no tenths;student:Zero,4
teacher:10 because if I have tenths Im going to have to have 10 tenths to make one whole,4
teacher:Onefifth;student:Fifth,4
teacher:Yes and then third subtract;student:You multiply 6 x 3 is 18 so I will subtract it,4
teacher:No so Im good to keep going;student:No,4
teacher:Good so I can fit 6 into 12 two times;student:6   12 I will get 2,4
teacher:Dont give away the answer;student:Never give away the answer,4
teacher:Yes coach your partner;student:You should remember to tell your partner why they got it wrong if they got it wrong,4
teacher:Oh it is 12;student:I didnt know eight 12,4
teacher:We do;student:Yes,4
teacher:50 there you go;student:50,4
teacher:This one should have four plus 10;student:lets say its five plus 10 and thats 15,4
teacher:If you think PEMDAS you think Oh Im supposed to do addition before subtraction then you would get this problem wrong,4
teacher:80 will be your final answer;student:80,4
teacher:Its 8;student:8,4
teacher:We have 4 x 2 x 10;student:4,4
teacher:11 right;student:11,4
teacher:I bet the other one that went to eight when you had a mistake in it;student:My question was even though I already had eight on it and,4
teacher:Only one;student:One,4
teacher:Four okay;student:Four,4
teacher:This should have been 10;student:10,4
teacher:26 minus 16;student:26,4
teacher:We have 8 plus 18 minus 8 times 2,4
teacher:Dog did this part first and then he did the subtraction and then multiplied those together,4
teacher:The cat is correct;student:The dogs not,4
teacher:Youre right I only have multiplication;student:Your next step for should be multiplication to division Youre going to have multiplication,4
teacher:So were going to do GEMS instead,4
teacher:Yes dog did 6  4 which is 10 and then multiplied by 2;student:Sorry he added first,4
teacher:We should multiply first we need to;student:He multiplied first,4
teacher:Isaiah was a good coach today;student:When I couldnt figure out the problem Isaiah helped me a lot,4
teacher:There shouldnt be a gap;student:What happens if theres a gap,4
teacher:How to subtract a column yes;student:Subtracting a column,4
teacher:We could divide by eight absolutely thats a common factor;student:Divide by eight,4
teacher:Yes so its sort of like we have 12 plus 12;student:Its really close to 12,4
teacher:Number four the sum of 12 and 58;student:I agree with four,4
teacher:Yes 48 you got it;student:48,4
teacher:Yes so 14 would be 75,4
teacher:Lets be careful about estimating because we want to be really precise with our work today;student:We could estimate or you use the ruler to measure how much it is,4
teacher:For every 6 boys there are 12 girls;student:I wrote for every 6 boys there are 12 girls,4
teacher:You might use the word double,4
teacher:If 80 divided by 10 is 8 then finish this statement for me,4
teacher:120 divided by 20;student:In the mean you would for after youve said we would divide 20 because theres 20 pieces of data divided by 120 because that,4
teacher:Just the number five;student:Yeah,4
teacher:Just 16,4
teacher:I divide by 8 thats going to get the number on the top to 10;student:Divide by 8,4
teacher:10 of 50 is 5,4
teacher:We want to get our percentage youre right to 10;student:That would be the quickest and easiest way to do it,4
teacher:Yes we had have 17 boxes;student:You just add the one column one more time then you would need 17 boxes with six extra bars,4
teacher:We could multiply by two;student:Times by two and then add column one,4
teacher:You could have totally done 10;student:Like 10,4
teacher:We could totally multiply by five;student:Five,4
teacher:Youre next job is to figure out how to do it without your directions,4
teacher:That would be lower than both of them and you want to try and get it to be in the middle;student:That would be lower than all both,4
teacher:This is not a decimal point this is a comparison;student:Are we going to use decimals,4
teacher:When Dog was getting three treats for every one trick the bunny is getting four treats for every one trick he does,4
teacher:We could divide by two absolutely;student:Two,4
teacher:Yes tricks and treats;student:Tricks and treats,4
teacher:Yes because if 48 is 12 it is a little bit bigger;student:He knows that 58 is a little bit bigger than 18 and its a two,4
teacher:It occurs when you move to the right;student:You said that it occurs to the right,4
teacher:Those are all three averages those are all different types of averages;student:That is technically the average obviously,4
teacher:Bigger than 90 degrees;student:90 degrees,4
teacher:Auden says this is an acute angle;student:Acute angle,4
teacher:Yes Im the point in the middle of the other two points;student:Because youre like the point in between the other two points,4
teacher:The vertex;student:Vertex,4
teacher:Auden said the hands of the clock are like angles,4
teacher:Theres a ton of different types of angles;student:There are a few angles obtuse right angles straight angles,4
teacher:It has the right answer;student:They have the right answer,4
teacher:No okay;student:No,4
teacher:Seven remainder five good;student:I got seven remainder five,4
teacher:No we just figured out that the answer is 5 carrots;student:No,4
teacher:Seven full trays so three four five six seven and then I have five carrots leftover I want to say apples so bad;student:Seven,4
teacher:No that means that its not full;student:No,4
teacher:By a picture absolutely;student:By using lots of circle and then by pictures,4
teacher:Long division absolutely;student:Long division,4
teacher:My remainder;student:Remainder,4
teacher:I can use partial quotients;student:Partial quotients,4
teacher:Yes only six eggs one half dozen can fit the carton;student:That only six eggs can fit in the carton,4
teacher:Six because six is half of 12;student:Six,4
teacher:Yes all right;student:Yes,4
teacher:No no remainder;student:No,4
teacher:6 x 1;student:Then you multiply,4
teacher:Id get zero and then check;student:You are going to get zero,4
teacher:12 and then subtract,4
teacher:A right angle make a right angle;student:A right angle,4
teacher:Yes there are six of them;student:Six,4
teacher:A right angle;student:Right,4
teacher:Yes the most frequent value;student:The highest value,4
teacher:45 total strokes into them divided by the nine different poles that would give us five;student:Theres nine data points so I divided 45 by 9 and I got 5,4
teacher:Okay you had two three times;student:I did,4
teacher:14 okay;student:14,4
teacher:Hold on;student:That is correct and you would have to count to 20 and then he would count that theres how many data points and then he would have to count 10 data points in,4
teacher:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 draw my line,4
teacher:20 all right;student:20,4
teacher:Its 21 awesome;student:Its 21,4
teacher:Three yes;student:Three,4
teacher:Yes so number of houses would be seven;student:Seven,4
teacher:12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 so our total number of people would be 21,4
teacher:Six yes;student:Six,4
teacher:It wouldnt be accurate data so we cant simply move them this way;student:There is no accurate data,4
teacher:Yes that looks pretty good because yellow is three red is two and green is five;student:Yes,4
teacher:Green which is five;student:Five,4
teacher:If we go one two three four five six one two three it would be in between these two fours,4
teacher:This is a house Dan and we cant just all of a sudden say Oh you just have to more people in your house,4
teacher:If theyre trying to find the mean using a line plot;student:By giving her line plots in general,4
teacher:Mean median and mode are all types of averages but something you should know is that a lot of times when people say average they mean mean,4
teacher:24 6 is 4;student:6 24 is 4,4
teacher:Our modes were three and six;student:Three and six,4
teacher:We think maybe four;student:Four,4
teacher:Yes because three occurs two times and six occurs two times so we have two modes;student:Six and three,4
teacher:Yes were going to talk about mean today;student:Mean,4
teacher:Yes we can find the median;student:Finding the median,4
teacher:Thats a lot but just note the goal;student:Yes,4
teacher:Rotten spoiled food;student:They use food,4
teacher:Multiplying a whole number by a fraction in some cases;student:Youre multiplying a whole number by a fraction,4
teacher:I didnt rip anything;student:No you did one but then you rip the other one,4
teacher:I have 12 of a Kleenex;student:Half,4
teacher:Right down the middle;student:Down in the middle,4
teacher:Rip it in half;student:Ripping like half,4
teacher:In the woods;student:The woods,4
teacher:They dont necessarily decompose the dirt they add the nutrients to the dirt;student:Dirt,4
teacher:It would be 20010x10 10x10100 so that would be 300;student:300,4
teacher:Not soil;student:Soil,4
teacher:Good breaks apart;student:Decomposing mean when something breaks apart,4
teacher:A group;student:Group,4
teacher:I have 14 and I have 12;student:I think it is 14,4
teacher:We can take this denominator multiply it by two,4
teacher:They are exactly the same thing right they are equivalent;student:This becomes six  so its equivalent,4
teacher:We have three in this numerator;student:Three twelfths,4
teacher:Theyre not the same;student:You can t add them together because theyre not,4
teacher:I hear half and three sixth;student:Three,4
teacher:Miss Isla picked four triangles;student:Four,4
teacher:Yes you want to reduce your denominator but thats not why her methods better than mine;student:Because we always have to try to find a less denominator,4
teacher:Me;student:You,4
teacher:Its gonna be reduced already;student:Shes reducing the fraction,4
teacher:It doesnt matter;student:No,4
teacher:So write the 12 over there to the side;student:So I figured out that three times four equals twelve,4
teacher:A cut;student:Cut,4
teacher:Youre going to have to figure it out;student:Were going to figure it out,4
teacher:How many cuts Ive done beautiful;student:How many cuts youve done,4
teacher:Id have to cut them both in half;student:Cut them both in half,4
teacher:Divisible;student:Dividable,4
teacher:She said that this was our one half,4
teacher:It was one half,4
teacher:So now youre supposed to break it into a common denominator,4
teacher:One whole because two out of two pieces equals one whole;student:One whole,4
teacher:I need two trapezoids,4
teacher:How many pieces you need to make a whole,4
teacher:Denominator and numerator and thats what Im looking for,4
teacher:Ill have to put one more red trapezoid;student:Another trapezoid,4
teacher:Onehalf of a hexagon;student:Hexagon,4
teacher:No but I have a capital and a period;student:No,4
teacher:I missing a capital letter at the beginning,4
teacher:Im a dog;student:Dog,4
teacher:I I is my subject;student:You,4
teacher:The answer is yes it is a sentence,4
teacher:Walker says when you add more than two numbers;student:A number sentence is when you add more than two numbers,4
teacher:If you didnt hear Lucy she said that we could take the number 60 we can add 2 and show that that can happen,4
teacher:If you look at what Ishmael is holding up he has one of those blue pieces which is equal to one out of six;student:16,4
teacher:Theres no not really the answer is no they are not;student:Not really,4
teacher:Ah so you see twofourths;student:Twofourths,4
teacher:Youre starting with the denominator;student:Denominator,4
teacher:Thats not onehalf thats more than onehalf;student:Because this is onehalf,4
teacher:I had four pieces;student:Four,4
teacher:By 12;student:12,4
teacher:We get 36,4
teacher:Multiply by eight;student:Times eight,4
teacher:My numerator;student:Your numerator,4
teacher:Four tenths and 4 hundredths are not;student:Theyre not equivalent,4
teacher:1000 so now lets look at the blue box;student:1000,4
teacher:1000 right because thats what our denominator tells us;student:1000,4
teacher:Ah if you didnt hear what Tati just said she said theres more pieces;student:That theres more pieces,4
teacher:No its not the same as 100;student:No,4
teacher:So our numerators are not the same exactly;student:Because the numerator has an extra or has a zero and thats 40,4
teacher:Equivalent yesterdays lesson remember equivalent;student:Equivalent,4
teacher:They are not the same;student:No,4
teacher:So if you didnt hear what Emiliano said he said if we multiply the hundred by 10 and then we multiply the four by 10 it works,4
teacher:Dont guess use that big brain on your head and figure it out;student:I want to guess,4
teacher:So we have 40 thousandths;student:Thousandths,4
teacher:Zero and 40;student:Forty,4
teacher:Where the decimal is;student:Decimal,4
teacher:Theyre placeholders very good Alex theyre placeholders now;student:Placeholders,4
teacher:Zero nothing theyre not worth anything;student:Zero nothing,4
teacher:I could write a million zeros over there and it doesnt change the fact that that is still zero and four tenths;student:No,4
teacher:Dont take dot dont say dot youre killing me;student:So if its like zero dot like zero dot,4
teacher:No the zero is just zero;student:And does the zero turn into a ten,4
teacher:Zero and;student:So each time you have like 05 or 02 does the zero,4
teacher:Not 10s tenths that TH on the end good;student:Zero and three ten,4
teacher:Remember the TH Once we hop over the decimal point were now in the THs as Delilah pointed out the tenths,4
teacher:We dont have any;student:Zero,4
teacher:Its a group;student:Group,4
teacher:So Alex said in the first one there are 40 slices of pizza that we want to eat out of a total of 100;student:40,4
teacher:And because 10 is a friendly number;student:groups of 10 because since theres five to fill a bag each row should have,4
teacher:Theres no six even on the board,4
teacher:Amount so think of it;student:Amount,4
teacher:Its more than half;student:More,4
teacher:Yes it is;student:Yes,4
teacher:List your multiples list your multiples;student:Factors multiples,4
teacher:Five and the reason for this is after were done with five youre going to come up and teach it;student:Five,4
teacher:Same size pieces;student:Same size,4
teacher:Good because the pieces are not the same size;student:Because the pieces are not the same size,4
teacher:Guys the whole reason we find a common denominator is because the pieces are not the same size,4
teacher:So we get 7296 on the left side of the equation,4
teacher:12 so we multiplied by 12;student:12,4
teacher:So our denominator on both sides is going to be equal to 96,4
teacher:So if you didnt hear that Marie said that we can multiply our two denominators together and it Mr Parker always work;student:8 times 12,4
teacher:So if you didnt hear what Miss Laurie said she said we cannot compare them the way they currently are Mr Evan focus today no napping because the size of the pieces are not the same,4
teacher:Okay so you say because theres not a common denominator;student:Because theres not a common denominator,4
teacher:Two I add my new zero and Im right back where I started;student:Two,4
teacher:Zero right three is bigger than two;student:None,4
teacher:Zero and seven tenths;student:And seven tenths,4
teacher:Im hearing people say zero and six;student:And six tenths,4
teacher:25 equals 100;student:25,4
teacher:There isnt one it would be 25;student:None zero,4
teacher:Tenths very good;student:Eight tenths,4
teacher:The tenths,4
teacher:Or eight tenths;student:eight out of 10,4
teacher:And then you may begin;student:We may begin,4
teacher:All right so we want to eat four slices of pizza,4
teacher:One whole bag;student:One whole,4
teacher:Nothing changed;student:Because its the numerator that change,4
teacher:Five chicken to fill up the KFC bucket;student:Because you need five to fill up one bag and theres three left so you dont have one full bag,4
teacher:Yes the cost of materials;student:How much they cost,4
teacher:Angel said were at 15 I have 10 more points,4
teacher:It is 10;student:Oh no,4
teacher:Two rides;student:Two,4
teacher:Taking another six points away;student:Taking,4
teacher:Its taking away not money;student:Its taking away money,4
teacher:Yes 15 minutes;student:Fifteen minutes,4
teacher:They are far apart yes youre right;student:Far apart,4
teacher:40100 which is 40,4
teacher:120 divided by 2 is 60 80 divided by 2 is 40,4
teacher:886  oh okay good good job yes thats awesome and I think;student:For team Y its 886,4
teacher:Everything is getting divided by two and that way the ratio is the same so 240 divided by two is one 120;student:Then I divided 240 by two which I got 120,4
teacher:Miya okay;student:Miya,4
teacher:All right so this number of people voted 31 yes 69 no so together that equals 100 17 plus 33 equals 50;student:I added 69 to 31 and I got 100 and then did 17 and 33 I got 50,4
teacher:Yes 75;student:Oh 75,4
teacher:Perfect its closer to a hundred percent than 50 percent Paulina said;student:Its closer to a hundred percent than,4
teacher:Okay so theres eight boxes;student:I counted the boxes and they were eight,4
teacher:40 so then we know that each box this is 16 26 et cetera;student:Oh 40,4
teacher:If you have two even numbers you could just divide by two;student:Two,4
teacher:Divide this by the number of pieces then that will give you that,4
teacher:Three is going to be up here so Mrs Reevess have 3 cans and youre trying to get to 15 cans,4
teacher:Yes do the exact same thing;student:Do I just do the exact same thing,4
teacher:Heres this three   3 x 5 because were trying to get the Mrs Reevess to 15 cans,4
teacher:Okay maybe thinking about the structure of the house;student:I think that the architect would need to consider the area because if you dont consider the area you might have a nonequal house or it might be lopsided or something,4
teacher:You did divided by 10 and then you did divide by 8 which is brilliant;student:I did times 10,4
teacher:You would want to think almost about city planning;student:Also with area you want to know the area because if your house is too big it could hit other buildings and then it would be bad,4
teacher:You could use a ruler a meterstick,4
teacher:It adds up to 24;student:That adds up to 24,4
teacher:You found out what 13 of 24 and what 23 of 24 is,4
teacher:One strategy that a classmate uses was drawing 24 boxes;student:I started out by making 24 boxes of juice 24 boxes in the case,4
teacher:He bought a case of juice;student:He bought a case,4
teacher:I see Grant has drawn 612  1224 so he is drawing some equivalent fractions;student:Kind of like this like if the numerator on this was 12 then this would be 6,4
teacher:24  18 because I took a whole 2424  1;student:You have to add 24 to 18 which you would get 42,4
teacher:It sounds like what I heard Jeremiah say was those kids werent doing the work;student:Because they werent doing the work they were just doing what they know from normal subtraction which is 18  20 is 2,4
teacher:Okay its wider;student:It is wider,4
teacher:When we changed when we make the xaxis bigger;student:No then that means it will be wider because thats the xaxis,4
teacher:Because you multiplied the coordinates two times and you found that it was two times bigger;student:Because we multiplied the coordinates two times,4
teacher:It might be the same just bigger;student:I think it might be the same,4
teacher:Yes so anything you do to the bottom youre going to do to the top;student:Because you multiply the nine by three then youre going to multiply  by three and you multiply the three by nine and then youre going to multiply three by nine,4
teacher:Yes lets change those numbers;student:First youre going to change,4
teacher:Yes could be a different person;student:Could it be a different person,4
teacher:Alicia says she noticed about Harpers work that she circled 69 which has the same denominator as 79;student:I noticed that she circled 69 which had the same denominator as 79,4
teacher:So what Rob just said is once you know multiplication when youre really good at multiplication it makes it easier to do fractions,4
teacher:119;student:119,4
teacher:It does seem long;student:This way seems really long and complicated,4
teacher:is speaking about the prefix of the word multi which means more than one,4
teacher:Equal to,4
teacher:Okay so it sounds like Chloes thinking about units and how you would share your measurements with someone;student:I think you can because the little marshmallows are kind of like a seven unit so you can say If you measure with four you can say its four seven units long,4
teacher:It sounds like what Ivy is saying is that in order to measure volume with an object it needs to be squared;student:Gummy sharks aint squared and the same on both sides all the sides,4
teacher:Sarah says gummy sharks are weirdly shaped and not flat;student:When youre building you want things to be straight so theyre not weird or lopsided and gummy sharks theyre straight and theyre also a little bit harder since theyre not necessarily flat and that could be harder and theyre very small,4
teacher:Yes weve used cubes to measure volume;student:Weve gotten the little cubes and then put them inside of the whole,4
teacher:What they are are fractions but they have to be cut into a certain number of pieces tenths hundreths or thousanths;student:Thousandths,4
teacher:You have to use ratio tables to solve;student:Do you do that to  solve the problem,4
teacher:Half of 60 is 30 and half of 80 is 40;student:30,4
teacher:We are multiplying big numbers but think of exactly how were doing;student:Because if we dont want to multiply a big number,4
teacher:Yes it means parts;student:Part,4
teacher:Half inches;student:One half,4
teacher:I would just say inches grown by students,4
teacher:Six unique numbers;student:Six,4
teacher:Were measuring in inches;student:Inches,4
teacher:Not the height;student:Just the height of the student,4
teacher:One half;student:Half,4
teacher:One;student:One and one half,4
teacher:We could say Mrs RobertssSgrowth,4
teacher:Smallest to greatest almost always;student:Smallest to biggest or biggest to smallest,4
teacher:Theres only two;student:Two,4
teacher:four Xs;student:Four,4
teacher:An X;student:Xs,4
teacher:A bar graph,4
teacher:Were working on the Xaxis,4
teacher:By putting a title;student:Title,4
teacher:The arrows,4
teacher:Points that show where numbers are,4
teacher:Well call them sacks;student:Sacks,4
teacher:We write our 35,4
teacher:More than likely youve got it right;student:Its right,4
teacher:The picture method;student:Picture,4
teacher:Zeros;student:Zero,4
teacher:Then you have to split this one in half so half of 70 is 35;student:Thats 35,4
teacher:This is called the dividend,4
teacher:Number per group;student:Number of marbles per bag,4
teacher:Mrs Reevess is 720,4
teacher:Yes third grade;student:Grade 3,4
teacher:Times the extras you got it;student:We do the greatest common factor times the extras,4
teacher:The greatest common factor is they share 2 3s so its 3 x 3;student:No  but is the greatest common factor three,4
teacher:32 because theres 2 of them times 23 because theres 3 of them,4
teacher:Yes four is not prime;student:Not prime is 4 x 2,4
teacher:Two got it;student:Two,4
teacher:Okay so 3x3;student:You can divide 9 by 3 x 3,4
teacher:Arianna says we dont want to do that because if you multiply 5 x 100 you get 500 we dont have 500,4
teacher:Thats how they taught us when we were kids but if you dont understand why that is just a remainder it doesnt do you any good;student:You cant write like R then put the number that you have for the remainder,4
teacher:6 times two is 12;student:12,4
teacher:Leaves us with three;student:Is three,4
teacher:We took 60 marbles out,4
teacher:Thinking box;student:Thinking,4
teacher:How many;student:Were trying to figure out how much bags we can make,4
teacher:Theres six fit in each bag,4
teacher:Yes I still have 75 marbles in my big bucket;student:You still have 75 marbles,4
teacher:Good in my big bucket;student:In the bucket,4
teacher:I was able to make 10 bags with those 60 marbles because I put six marbles in each bag;student:10,4
teacher:100 I can use it;student:Yes,4
teacher:Not too big and not too small and its easy;student:Its not too big and its not too small,4
teacher:Yes its just backwards;student:Oh its just backwards,4
teacher:My number of groups so my groups;student:Groups,4
teacher:This is called the divisor,4
teacher:Okay so youre multiplying two numbers;student:Multiplying them by another number,4
teacher:Well yeah itll have a decimal point thats definitely another thing;student:The decimal point,4
teacher:It is prime;student:Prime,4
teacher:Yes I live in an apartment,4
teacher:Water is not included in my rent,4
teacher:If I had children that would be another expense the electricity;student:If you had children you need to take care of them as well,4
teacher:Those are called toiletries toothpaste toilet paper;student:Toothpaste,4
teacher:Things I want come last;student:Things you want,4
teacher:We know how much they have right now,4
teacher:Yes we want it to be quick and we want it to be the least amount of steps as possible;student:Do something quick,4
teacher:Trade first where you trade first before you start subtracting;student:Trade first,4
teacher:Two hundred eightynine thousandths thats exactly what you should have written down;student:Two hundred eightynine thousandths,4
teacher:Friends you should have seven and eighttenths written on your board,4
teacher:Align okay;student:Align,4
teacher:With it being right and the least amount of steps;student:With it being right,4
teacher:Okay so I exist out one row;student:It has a a four and you exist out four little ones,4
teacher:So i am going to Subtract one Im gong to exist out one who row;student:Subtract one,4
teacher:I need to exit out nine of those hundredths;student:Because you need nine hundredths,4
teacher:A whole;student:One,4
teacher:One two three four five;student:Lets do five of them,4
teacher:Lucy is like Okay look at the tenths how many rows were filled in,4
teacher:The squares one two three four;student:Four of the squares,4
teacher:This is our whole;student:Thats whole,4
teacher:Hundreds grid;student:Hundreds,4
teacher:Tenths the whole grid;student:Tens,4
teacher:To solve something as quickly as possible,4
teacher:Oh 12 and 19 cents includes tax;student:Is there any tax,4
teacher:20 should be on top,4
teacher:You are supposed to put the largest number at the top when subtracting;student:When you are subtracting you are supposed to put the largest number at the top,4
teacher:Denominators;student:Denominator,4
teacher:Finding the common denominator or borrowing;student:Either finding the common denominator or having to borrow,4
teacher:We need to find the common denominator,4
teacher:31 3;student:11 3,4
teacher:We did not have to find the common denominator;student:We didn t have to find the common denominator because both have the same denominator,4
teacher:To show a deeper understanding;student:Maybe to understand,4
teacher:To show your work,4
teacher:We will know we re successful today we can use drawings or if you would like to use fractions circle pieces to help solve your subtraction problems;student:I will know Im successful when I can use drawings or fractions circle pieces to solve problems 25 on page 164,4
teacher:Finding the common denominator,4
teacher:So youre  16,4
teacher:Three over three,4
teacher:I mean two times five and that equals 10,4
teacher:I can just look at two times 10;student:The reason why its bigger because not only are you multiplying it by two which makes it 10 youre also multiplying it by a third which makes it,4
teacher:Five times two and one third is bigger than five;student:For B I said that five times two and one third was bigger than five,4
teacher:Its going to be five over two;student:Because five times two is 10,4
teacher:When my answer is multiplied by one the product is that number;student:Answer to a multiplication problem,4
teacher:Multiply the numerator and the denominator with the same number;student:We talked about how maybe the rule could be when you multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number,4
teacher:So step one multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number,4
teacher:So youre saying its equal to a half,4
teacher:I see Bander is done and I see a couple of people still working;student:Oh I m done,4
teacher:I see River is done;student:I m done,4
teacher:I probably dont want it to be confused that I have 81 verse 8000 those are two very different numbers,4
teacher:I think everyone had on their whiteboards 781;student:781,4
teacher:The American flag represents the United States of America,4
teacher:In a different way;student:A different way,4
teacher:Yes erase your boards;student:Can we erase,4
teacher:65 tenths okay;student:70 and 65 tenths,4
teacher:Two place values;student:Two times,4
teacher:Okay so youre going to move it to the right;student:To the right because you are multiplying you move to the right and when you are dividing you move to the left,4
teacher:One two three four five six;student:Six,4
teacher:Its the quotient;student:Quotient,4
teacher:Dividing by a whole number;student:Dividing by,4
teacher:Is the divisor yes;student:This divisor,4
teacher:The string is one meter long so each of these would be a third;student:I drew a string and I cut it into three parts,4
teacher:A number sentence so we are matching up;student:A number sentence,4
teacher:Oh  its a number sentence;student:Number sentence,4
teacher:210 of 8;student:Yes because you  8 and then you have to find out the 14 of that,4
teacher:On the fish;student:On food,4
teacher:Three toys nice;student:Three,4
teacher:They said 6 x 12;student:Multiplication of that you do 6 x 12,4
teacher:It should be related to that;student:related to that,4
teacher:Of 54;student:54,4
teacher:9 x 6 is 54;student:50,4
teacher:If you were trying to figure out what 13 of the total area is;student:13 of 9 and 13 of 6,4
teacher:It could be if you have like one square yard;student:One,4
teacher:Twice as much at the store 20 at the dentist twice as much as the store so 20 x 2 would be 40 is what they said;student:At the store,4
teacher:Yes because I read left to right;student:Yes,4
teacher:Multiplicative identity property,4
teacher:Yes where the denominator and numerator are equal;student:The denominator and the numerator is equal,4
teacher:The product is always less than the original number you started with;student:Then I had to think about how you multiply a fraction by a whole number is always less than the product,4
teacher:By 10 to the fifth;student:I think that the decimal will move five places to the right because since youre multiplying it by five you re,4
teacher:Yes so multiply top and bottom by 2;student:By 2,4
teacher:Okay 7900;student:The answer is 7900,4
teacher:Shed multiply one times eight and get eight and thats close to 96;student:I would round the 12 down to one times eight because thats close to 96,4
teacher:Perpendicular horizontal;student:Perpendicular,4
teacher:Coordinates great;student:New coordinates,4
teacher:The origin okay;student:The origin,4
teacher:Were right;student:Are we right,4
teacher:Right 00 down;student:00,4
teacher:Zero times anything is zero okay;student:Because zero times anything is zero,4
teacher:Good vocabulary yes;student:Good vocab,4
teacher:Y Its not going to work so I want you to find it in your vocabulary book Yaxis and Xaxis,4
teacher:How to enlarge a picture on a coordinate grid;student:How to enlarge a picture,4
teacher:Yes because youre dividing it in half,4
teacher:Starting by yourself until I say the magic word showdown;student:By ourselves,4
teacher:older than Damien;student:Four years older,4
teacher:It sure is;student:Yes,4
teacher:Five is the numerator and four is the denominator;student:five and the denominator is four,4
teacher:Onefourth of five;student:Five,4
teacher:What Im seeing is four wholes and one leftover which makes a half and a half;student:Im splitting them and Im counting up to nine and then I got to eight but then this one would have  one left over,4
teacher:Right so pairs compare;student:You get with your partner and then two people talk together and then you all four go together,4
teacher:Between the three and the zero here;student:Between the three and,4
teacher:Okay so this is 219;student:219,4
teacher:Yes estimate;student:You can estimate,4
teacher:Numbers yes;student:I also noticed that in the answers theySShave the same numbers,4
teacher:Yes 10 times three so youd round the 11 down to 10 and then round this up to three and 10 times three equals 30 so we know that the decimal goes there;student:10 times three equals 30,4
teacher:Its really close to 308;student:110 times three equals 330 which is near 308,4
teacher:Eight is really close to 96 the answer to these,4
teacher:Now I have 2 and 86;student:8,4
teacher:Thats a common mistake is not noticing that you have to borrow because its really easy to just be like Oh yes lets just do 2  3;student:We didnt notice that you had to borrow so we noticed that we cant take 2 away from 6 and 3,4
teacher:Its 9;student:9,4
teacher:Two and we get 16;student:Two,4
teacher:Three so  2x36;student:Three,4
teacher:Two so 15 of 10 is 2 two;student:Two,4
teacher:An argument is almost Theres multiple means of the word but this in this case is you saying This is what I think is this and an argument between two people is because one person is going Here is what I think and the other person is going No heres what I think;student:argument is like  argue,4
teacher:It could be three;student:Three,4
teacher:It would be five;student:Five,4
teacher:14 months but then it just stays in a straight line after that;student:14 months,4
teacher:Okay so hits a straight line and then goes at 12 inches for a while;student:I agree with her that it said that they grow up to 12 inches because like what Allie said it even says it in the video and on the graph it only goes up to 12 inches and then it goes in a straight line,4
teacher:Okay so thats their height youre saying that thats their height before even a month old;student:Okay so it means its like when they havent reached one month yet theyre like a couple of days old or theyre like two weeks old,4
teacher:Their height in inches;student:The height in inches,4
teacher:Anthony did 310  1100 and so on,4
teacher:Thats not 32 hundredths;student:Could you do  100,4
teacher:Four pieces exactly;student:Four pieces,4
teacher:Just five pieces;student:510,4
teacher:Yes so its halves and fifths;student:12 and 25,4
teacher:It sounds like both Riley and Garret multiplied the denominators to figure out what size fraction to use;student:First I did 2x5 it was 10 and then I knew that 12 of a 10 was 510 and then 25t of 10 would be 410 so I did 5410 would be 910 of your candy bar,4
teacher:Somewhat yes;student:Yes,4
teacher:You do need to have a label;student:They all have a label,4
teacher:I want you to have a number model or this falls into the show your work;student:You want a model,4
teacher:Yes the equal size is important exactly;student:It says that Nick wants to cut one chocolate bar into pieces of equal size,4
teacher:Yes so they each get the right amounts and there is another thing that is important;student:That they will get the right amount,4
teacher:That it is one chocolate bar;student:One chocolate bar,4
teacher:Total yes;student:How much in total,4
teacher:Its the way to solve the problem and it s a way to consolidate the equation but its the different steps,4
teacher:Yes you can use the unit to help you figure that out;student:Its simpler if we respond with unit,4
teacher:Okay so circle to square to hexagon back to circle;student:Well we were saying I was telling Brody that it was a stepbystep procedure because it s going from circle to square and to And then after that back to the circle,4
teacher:Those are the two words I had in my head quickly and efficiently;student:Like being able to do something quickly and efficiently,4
teacher:Three times 10;student:Three and ten,4
teacher:Yes clearly because they give you space for four of them;student:Yes,4
teacher:Okay so our first one would have been one and 30;student:One and thirty,4
teacher:There you go five times six;student:3 and 5 oh wait no 3 and wait no 6 and 5,4
teacher:Two times 28 we get 56;student:28,4
teacher:Division so we had to work backwards to get division;student:Division,4
teacher:It is six;student:Is it 6,4
teacher:Twelve good;student:12,4
teacher:Yes because remember when you change the total number of pieces you also change the number of pieces you care about or that you ate or that you have leftover;student:Yes,4
teacher:Okay and 25 would be 410;student:I agree with Matthew because 12 equals 510 and then you add the 410,4
teacher:Adding fractions or knowing where the iPad is pointing;student:Adding,4
teacher:Fraction circles are your friend;student:Fraction,4
teacher:You did 412 plus 312 equals 712;student:and got 712,4
teacher:Okay so 36 plus 26 equals 56;student:Then I  36 plus 26 equals 56,4
teacher:36;student:Three,4
teacher:So see if you can find a fraction that will fit into 12 evenly and 13 evenly;student:You have to find a fraction that evenly fit both 12 and 13,4
teacher:You did 48 plus 78,4
teacher:You totally know what that means and I know what that means but I would still say And then multiply the denominators instead of doing the same for the denominators,4
teacher:Okay so lets do numerator times numerator denominator times denominator;student:I  multiply the denominator with the other denominator then you could just multiply the numerator with the other numerator,4
teacher:13 times 35 thats very beautiful Im sure  equals 3 There at least  to look good;student:I got 13 times 35 equals 315,4
teacher:So 34 times 23 equals 612;student:12,4
teacher:13 and 23;student:13 23,4
teacher:A rectangle;student:Rectangle,4
teacher:You could go back to the square;student:You go back to,4
teacher:You can you can still use multiplication but you got to kind of work backwards because the numbers getting bigger from left to right so youd have to divide to go from right to left;student:Yeah you have to divide,4
teacher:Id be eight eighths of my drive if I was all the way from my parents house,4
teacher:Okay driving from different places;student:Youre driving from two different places like A to a point,4
teacher:Four so were going to do fourths;student:Four,4
teacher:Yes four tickKingslys;student:I labeled it by fourths because I saw that there are four tickKingslys,4
teacher:412 okay;student:You have to multiply 412 x 1,4
teacher:Austin saw he needs to do 14 x 34 so 34 x 14 its going to be the same answer;student:The area of the shaded rectangle all you have to do is 14 x 34,4
teacher:Not 23;student:23 by,4
teacher:how high you can jump;student:How high I can jump,4
teacher:Theyre in thirds;student:I noticed that theyre both in 13 so they were split into thirds,4
teacher:Yes fractions;student:Fractions with the same,4
teacher:A fraction;student:The colors represented whats it called the fractions,4
teacher:One is in the hundredths one is in the thousandths;student:Because ones in the hundredths and the,4
teacher:One because my numerator is one;student:One,4
teacher:So color one of those ends really dark;student:One,4
teacher:Okay and then I ate 26 out of all of the pizza;student:Six,4
teacher:Yes so I have 26;student:Because you have two and six,4
teacher:Not 46;student:46,4
teacher:One so I only ate one;student:One,4
teacher:Youre right thirds;student:I need to put it into thirds and fourths,4
teacher:Overall 14;student:14,4
teacher:Okay how many halves go into 34;student:How many halves go into 34,4
teacher:Okay so we had a half of 34 not 68;student:Because I knew that 34 I couldnt divide that by a 12 because it was odd and odd number,4
teacher:Multiply the fraction by another fraction;student:I think multiplying a fraction by another fraction,4
teacher:Multiplication;student:Its like multiplying,4
teacher:Yes half of 15;student:Half of 15 because 15 is an odd number,4
teacher:Six yes;student:Six,4
teacher:Were not adding miles were just adding fractions;student:Unless we know the miles and we actually add the actual miles we cant really add them,4
teacher:When youre multiplying a fraction by a number higher than one its going to be greater;student:I think its going to be greater because when youre multiplying a number higher than one its going to be greater,4
teacher:Whenever you multiply by one the number you multiply one by always stays itself;student:You have to multiply the numerator times one and that always just stays the same,4
teacher:You heard the word all together you think that we would add because weve heard all together;student:That makes me think that you would add,4
teacher:Oh I said altogether okay;student:I guess you would add since you said altogether,4
teacher:You re saying what your partner said but you re putting it into your own words,4
teacher:So youre thinking about a judge;student:I think justified means make it right because a judge  justified,4
teacher:Julia said to explain why your answer is correct;student:I don t quite agree because I think it means like to explain why your answer is correct,4
teacher:Eliza said justice reminded here of adjust so maybe it means change your thinking to something better,4
teacher:Okay and 25 would be 410;student:I agree with Theo because 12 equals 510 and then you add the 410,4
teacher:Adding fractions or knowing where the iPad is pointing;student:Adding,4
teacher:Fraction circles are your friend;student:Fraction,4
teacher:You did 412 plus 312 equals 712;student:and got 712,4
teacher:Okay so 36 plus 26 equals 56;student:Then I  36 plus 26 equals 56,4
teacher:36;student:Three,4
teacher:So see if you can find a fraction that will fit into 12 evenly and 13 evenly;student:You have to find a fraction that evenly fit both 12 and 13,4
teacher:You did 48 plus 78,4
teacher:Its more;student:More,4
teacher:So 24 is 12;student:I know that 24 equals 12 and the  but plus 14 is bigger,4
teacher:Oh Jeremy;student:Im with Jeremy,4
teacher:Pita chips;student:Ive had the chips,4
teacher:Into halves okay;student:Into halves,4
teacher:They used cups as their picture good;student:I notice that they used cups as their picture,4
teacher:I mean a picture,4
teacher:A whole good;student:A whole,4
teacher:Kayla okay;student:Kayla,4
teacher:Which will still be smaller than 78 good;student:I think its going to be less than because if youre still just multiplying them if you multiply the numerators youre going to get a higher number which will still be smaller than the,4
teacher:200 if I substitute zero in for M 20010x00,4
teacher:17 that sounds good;student:Y 5X 17,4
teacher:It will be total calories;student:Dependent is calories and independent is minutes,4
teacher:Zero yes;student:Zero,4
teacher:Thirteen yes;student:Thirteen,4
teacher:Nine yes;student:Nine,4
teacher:Trapezoid correct;student:Trapezoid,4
teacher:The length and height of one side;student:Height and length,4
teacher:Eight hundred write in 800;student:Eight hundred,4
teacher:Positive number so these two numbers cant be crossed out;student:Positive number,4
teacher:Because in this case we get a positive number;student:Because a positive number will come out of this,4
teacher:The negative main number has an even exponent;student:There is an even number its an even exponent,4
teacher:Fifty to the fifth power very good;student:Plus 50 to the fifth power,4
teacher:There is a star next to number 23;student:Twentythree,4
teacher:So you cancel out those numbers that equal to zero,4
teacher:Absolutely its correct;student:Yes,4
teacher:Because raising powers surpasses multiplication correct;student:Because power of a product surpasses everything else,4
teacher:Two to the seventh power;student:To the seventh power,4
teacher:Number two is the main number so write number two and now find out the exponent;student:Write the main number two 128,4
teacher:Positive fine;student:Positive,4
teacher:The answer is 27000,4
teacher:No not plus;student:Plus,4
teacher:Youll raise the powers;student:First I multiply three to the third power,4
teacher:We multiply it;student:We multiply three times five,4
teacher:To the third power fine;student:Eight divided by two to the third power,4
teacher:Write the formula A times 10 to the N power;student:Write A times 10 to the N power,4
teacher:A is bigger because the second equation in the lower equation A minus B is equal to eight;student:A,4
teacher:So fourteen will be substituted back into the equation,4
teacher:Three X minus three X will be zero;student:Three X minus three X,4
teacher:Its okay even if its two types or even its three types;student:Is it okay with two,4
teacher:If its approximate;student:Its appro approximate,4
teacher:If this and this are not parallel then this angle is not 60 degrees;student:If you draw a parallel line,4
teacher:It is solvable;student:You can solve this,4
teacher:Its okay with the outside,4
teacher:Draw a perpendicular line from point B;student:Then,4
teacher:From the top line it would be an L huh;student:Is it L,4
teacher:They are equal,4
teacher:Two X only;student:Two X,4
teacher:It is already expanded form;student:Yes,4
teacher:Some say expanded some say factorized;student:Factorized form,4
teacher:Therefore equal,4
teacher:Yes the lefthand side is still equal to the righthand side;student:Yes,4
teacher:It is also 16;student:Sixteen,4
teacher:Fourteen again;student:Fourteen,4
teacher:You will find that it is 10;student:Ten,4
teacher:One hundred and 80 degrees;student:One hundred,4
teacher:All the sides are equal;student:Are equal,4
teacher:Yes okay;student:Yes,4
teacher:Two times three;student:Three,4
teacher:Times two;student:Two,4
teacher:It became zero;student:Zero,4
teacher:Twentyfour right;student:Twentyfour,4
teacher:Two times three for example;student:Two times three,4
teacher:To the eighth power and make sure this one is smaller;student:Three to the eighth power,4
teacher:So the two main numbers are three fine and well divide these two numbers;student:Three to the eighth power,4
teacher:Quotient good;student:Quotient,4
teacher:Six because the root of four times nine;student:Six,4
teacher:Correct 15 minus 12;student:Fifteen minus 12,4
teacher:Negative three its already up on the board good;student:Negative three,4
teacher:Fifteen minus 18 should be;student:Fifteen minus 18,4
teacher:Negative 19 plus one equals negative 18;student:Negative 19,4
teacher:Minus nine fine;student:Minus nine,4
teacher:And we do have minus one there,4
teacher:Nine minus two equals two;student:Nine minus two,4
teacher:Okay I heard the number four somewhere;student:Four,4
teacher:From four and minus 12;student:From 12 and four,4
teacher:Seven and four;student:Number four and number seven,4
teacher:Four plus 12 correct;student:Four plus 12,4
teacher:Additions correct;student:Additions,4
teacher:The letter A;student:Letter A,4
teacher:Fine youll have the letter A;student:I have the letter A,4
teacher:So as a rule we use multiplication first we figure out the power by multiplying it first then dividing and last is adding;student:Because first I figured out the power and then I multiplied it,4
teacher:The tenth power fine;student:The tenth power,4
teacher:Excellent eight to the tenth power;student:Eight to the tenth power,4
teacher:To the third power;student:The third power,4
teacher:Exponent or we may use a foreign word exponent thats correct as well;student:Exponent,4
teacher:To the second power good;student:To the second power,4
teacher:Yes underlined twice;student:Yes,4
teacher:Three point fourteen is used as Pi;student:Three point fourteen,4
teacher:Negative 20 correct;student:Negative 20,4
teacher:Triangle and yes;student:Triangle,4
teacher:The root of the number yes;student:Okay so first we calculate the power of a number,4
teacher:Thirty minus 20 equals 10 and 10 squared is 100,4
teacher:Five to the eleventh power fine;student:Five to the eleventh power,4
teacher:And to the fifth power;student:To the fifth power,4
teacher:The main number is the same fine;student:The main number,4
teacher:Seven times D;student:Seven,4
teacher:To the second power very good;student:To the second power,4
teacher:Power of what number;student:Power numbers,4
teacher:It got easy for you great;student:When I figured out the formula it got easy after that,4
teacher:All the problems and youre satisfied with the results;student:All of them,4
teacher:I see youve substituted X with one for example and one cubed minus one cubed equals zero;student:So X A cubed equals zero,4
teacher:Zero very good;student:Zero,4
teacher:Well yes but that equals zero;student:But I can write zero A to the fifth power,4
teacher:That was already crossed out fine;student:That was already crossed out,4
teacher:Is one X squared and as you can see we got into the circle;student:Is one X squared,4
teacher:Four X squared;student:Four,4
teacher:The middle which is X squared;student:X squared which is in the middle,4
teacher:Okay two different exponents;student:There are two different exponents,4
teacher:Good thats a bit more difficult for us at this time because weve said that well go up to the fourth power for now but the answer is 10 X to the fifth power;student:Ten X to the fifth power,4
teacher:X cubed correct;student:Cubed,4
teacher:The squared numbers separate;student:And the squared numbers,4
teacher:The cubed numbers may be added up;student:The cubed numbers may be added,4
teacher:The area of the square;student:Square,4
teacher:Two A cubed because two A cubed is like two squares A cubed plus A cubed;student:Two A cubed,4
teacher:The whole number to the third power;student:Negative four to the third power,4
teacher:The answer is negative 36 which is up on the board;student:So the answer is negative 36,4
teacher:If you draw it over here then the area that is the same as this triangle is,4
teacher:Um the day the smaller brothers is bigger is X days later,4
teacher:Numbers greater than,4
teacher:Two A minus five B correct;student:Two A minus five B,4
teacher:Correct equals minus four A B I have factorized further because the;student:Six X Y plus four X Y and minus seven A A B plus three A B,4
teacher:Three U plus four V correct;student:Three U plus four V,4
teacher:Eh just calculate it;student:Well just go ahead and calculate instead of  do the intermediate step,4
teacher:Not two to the power of N but just two N Thats right;student:Two N,4
teacher:You could have taken three out as well;student:Three,4
teacher:Yes you can add the plus but it is not necessary;student:Yes add the plus,4
teacher:And S over here;student:And then an S at the top,4
teacher:It goes next to it;student:Well next to it,4
teacher:Exactly right minus two X times 27 is minus 54 X,4
teacher:X thats correct;student:X,4
teacher:Yes then it is correct;student:Yes,4
teacher:Twentyeight C Oh that was last times homework thats the previous homework;student:Twentyeight C,4
teacher:Yes it has to be I know that much as well but;student:It has to be,4
teacher:Because eight plus four is 12 three times the 12 is 36;student:Thirtysix,4
teacher:Three times minus two;student:Minus two,4
teacher:Twentyone yes;student:Twentyone,4
teacher:Three for example;student:Three,4
teacher:So to X is one belongs Y is 15;student:Is 15,4
teacher:Yes the lines in there;student:The lines in there,4
teacher:And you will use the equations of A B and C please look for a moment exercise 15;student:The ones of A B and C,4
teacher:Plus five times H plus five times H plus five times H plus five times H;student:And then afterwards you still have to write down five um times five five times H,4
teacher:Let me check here you have 60 times this 20 is 7200;student:And one 120 times 60 is 7200,4
teacher:Times nine Y yes you didnt specify but one could hear from your speech that it stands in brackets hm;student:Hm two X squared minus one times nine Y,4
teacher:This is also 50;student:Fifty centimeters,4
teacher:That can very possibly be right;student:Can this be right,4
teacher:X plus five has to be zero correct Ive got that here so that we dont have to write that much correct;student:And as both are the same X is plus five equals zero,4
teacher:One thats shorter;student:Shorter,4
teacher:In case its wrong you take another piece and then you use the rest of the straw;student:And if its wrong,4
teacher:Of course you can already cut it yes;student:Madam can we already cut it,4
teacher:Is correct;student:Its correct,4
teacher:Also C;student:C,4
teacher:Seventeen right;student:teen,4
teacher:That would be a length of eight because the length five plus the length three would add up to the length eight;student:A length of eight,4
teacher:Yes on the one hand it equals 27;student:Equals 27,4
teacher:Once twice,4
teacher:Correct thats two lengths;student:Two lengths,4
teacher:Eh D It has to be X squared;student:That one D,4
teacher:Minus three equals zero thats correct now wonderful;student:Minus three,4
teacher:Equals seven X Hm;student:Ehm nine X minus eh two X equals seven X,4
teacher:Six X six minus three three X is left in the middle Our hopes are diminishing if its not going to work out this time;student:Six X,4
teacher:Minus one 17 X thats something else yet;student:Minus o well one,4
teacher:Minus three X all right we can forget that thats wrong;student:Minus three X,4
teacher:Minus or just two X equals plus three;student:Minus two X,4
teacher:Three X and two X;student:Well three and two right,4
teacher:Fourteen or X equals minus 14;student:Fourteen or minus 14,4
teacher:X is 11 in the second one look I covered it at the front;student:Is X 11,4
teacher:Yes thats correct;student:Is this correct like that,4
teacher:One hundred and twentyone yes thats what it comes to;student:One hundred and twentyone,4
teacher:X has to be minus five;student:Hm does X have to be minus five,4
teacher:X to the power of two do the check;student:X plus five to the power of two,4
teacher:I would write it in the same spot where the diameter is;student:I believe I have to know the diameter,4
teacher:Yes it does;student:Yes but if you start filling in something for Y then it doesnt make sense any more,4
teacher:The calculation is correct but you still have to answer it;student:Then is this uh correct then because uh,4
teacher:Divided by 10;student:Ten,4
teacher:Okay so if I go 10 steps to the right then I have to go down 125;student:One hundred twentyfive,4
teacher:It is minus anyhow youve seen that correctly;student:That is let me see that is minus that is minus one oh that is minus,4
teacher:Yes that is always the Y;student:Uh Y,4
teacher:With cell phones right when you want to compare prices;student:Cell phones,4
teacher:In scuba diving right;student:In scuba diving,4
teacher:Starting number is minus three;student:Uh B is three and you add that,4
teacher:In front of the slope yes;student:It has to be um it has to be um in front of the slope,4
teacher:You thought that this intersecting point would be approximately at four;student:Well because it uh well I thought that those black lines crossed the vertical line at four,4
teacher:You thought one;student:Uh well personally I thought it might be one,4
teacher:That one is on the vertical axis Peter;student:The vertical line,4
teacher:The X and the Y are reversed;student:The Y is reversed,4
teacher:You dont even have that one;student:Oh I dont have that one,4
teacher:Oh theres the price of the basket;student:The basket price,4
teacher:Two 200 X;student:Two hundred X,4
teacher:Itll become ten minus X,4
teacher:Its a problem asking how many 230 yen cakes you can buy so;student:How many 230 yen cakes you buy,4
teacher:You set up an inequality equation;student:Inequality equation,4
teacher:Its okay if theres left over;student:We dont need to its okay if we have change left over right,4
teacher:Not over 10;student:Its also okay if its over 10 right,4
teacher:Oh if you want to set up an inequality equation go ahead thats fine too;student:Inequality equation,4
teacher:Were buying 10 anyhow;student:Were buying 10,4
teacher:More than 30,4
teacher:At 12 so then continue with 13;student:At 12,4
teacher:That is just 38;student:Thirtyeight,4
teacher:Y is four and this I cant read;student:I have Y is four,4
teacher:It is positive because it lays above the axis;student:Positive,4
teacher:Okay the whole garden;student:That is the whole garden,4
teacher:Correct equal to the square root of four very good;student:Oh uh it is equal to uh the square root of four,4
teacher:Yes is two times A B;student:Is two times AB,4
teacher:So its five because there are five tiles in there;student:Five,4
teacher:Its an exact square;student:As a square,4
teacher:That is nine;student:Nine,4
teacher:So this one is 13;student:So the length is 13,4
teacher:So it becomes 25 indeed;student:Twentyfive,4
teacher:Together they are if I add these two surface areas together are equal in size as that one;student:They are equally big as the other ones,4
teacher:We will make it into a rectangle,4
teacher:You can just see it;student:I dont know how you calculate it but I can just see it,4
teacher:Nine well what the unit is I dont know I didnt specify that;student:Uh nine centimeters squared,4
teacher:Yes all the way on the other side;student:Yes,4
teacher:All the sides are equal all three sides;student:All sides are equal,4
teacher:A and B are equal in size;student:That A and B are equal,4
teacher:In any case it has a right angle;student:It has a right angle,4
teacher:We have a rightangled triangle;student:Rightangled,4
teacher:The uh this gentleman was Greek;student:Uh I think this guy was a Greek,4
teacher:You know the equation A squared plus B squared equals C squared;student:A squared plus B squared equals C squared,4
teacher:One half very good;student:One half for example,4
teacher:C is not linear either no;student:C is not linear either then,4
teacher:Yes squared;student:You have to square it,4
teacher:You always start with the slope;student:Do you have to start with the slope,4
teacher:Five X minus three;student:Y equals five times minus three X minus three,4
teacher:And O is pi times D;student:Pi pi pi,4
teacher:It depends on the diameter,4
teacher:Diameter correct;student:Diameter,4
teacher:No because it only works for some of them;student:No,4
teacher:A graph yes;student:A graph,4
teacher:Diagram with numbers equations,4
teacher:Sixtytwo this is it,4
teacher:Okay and Eric washed more three more than Catherine did;student:Five minus three equals two,4
teacher:Okay so if he started with six and he sold three then he  would have the same number as Dad;student:Three plus three equals six,4
teacher:Right okay you think that Don has four;student:That makes Don have four,4
teacher:He has one fewer he has two;student:Two,4
teacher:Tennis balls;student:Jim has 3  tennis,4
teacher:You have okay little stones;student:Rocks,4
teacher:Five less;student:Five,4
teacher:Fewer;student:Less,4
teacher:I ll write minus twelve;student:A little minus by the twelve,4
teacher:This is seven more in that bag than there were before;student:Seven more,4
teacher:There is more than seven;student:At least seven,4
teacher:Seven more okay and I m going to write that this way;student:Seven more,4
teacher:That is negative six;student:Negative six,4
teacher:You say three you say three  it works;student:Three is not going to work,4
teacher:Now various people are saying three;student:Three,4
teacher:Yes the same number has to be;student:Doesn t it have to be all one number have to be in   every box,4
teacher:Put the same number in all of the other boxes that is  exactly right;student:Put it in the rest of them,4
teacher:And thats what we were hearing over there multiply it by 2 to get 6,4
teacher:Okay and so for this grouping of 3 heres where you see your 2 cups of chocolate and 1 cup of cream;student:And then for every 3 cups thered be 2 cups of chocolate and 1 cup of cream,4
teacher:Its going to be a cone yeah;student:A cone,4
teacher:Okay so a total of 27 cups rather than the total of 9;student:Um because I think that person got it mixed up by thinking that the other times the 2 cups chocolate to the 9 the answer of the in total of 9 cups the answer of 1 cup of cream to the 9 whole to the in total of 9 cups so then he um so he made 27 cups,4
teacher:That does make sense but  so you  oops sorry,4
teacher:I know thats one name one twelfth,4
teacher:You re not sure what the questions is;student:Im not sure,4
teacher:It wouldnt fit in it;student:Well it wouldnt fit,4
teacher:You wouldnt measure them the same;student:You re not measuring the same,4
teacher:The children are bigger than the boat;student:The children are bigger,4
teacher:You really didnt;student:No,4
teacher:Some of you built different models and I asked you a  question about that;student:Some of us built the same models and some of us built  different,4
teacher:Right which is bigger,4
teacher:And two brown rods;student:And two browns,4
teacher:Two browns to be one third;student:I took two browns and put them together,4
teacher:Ok she made a model with an orange a blue and a black,4
teacher:On this same train I  could show one sixth,4
teacher:Twentyfour also;student:Twentyfour,4
teacher:Andrew has twentyfour;student:Um twentyfour whites,4
teacher:Youre imagining twentyfour;student:Twentyfour,4
teacher:Brian thinks then white ones in the next train would be one  twentyfourth;student:Um one twentyfourth I think,4
teacher:But we we call the whole one;student:Well the next the next the next larger one will be I think  the whole will be twentyfour,4
teacher:Were all the same length;student:Were the same length,4
teacher:Ok so you have three quarters and a half;student:We only have the half and the whole,4
teacher:Ok so the green is one sixteenth,4
teacher:So we have one twelfth we have four fortyeighths,4
teacher:You mean four fortyeighths,4
teacher:We know its one twelfth we agreed its one twelfth and  youve proved its one twelfth,4
teacher:Ok David thinks four twelfths,4
teacher:She remembers that two thirds is larger;student:Uh that two thirds is larger,4
teacher:You mean yeah the two thirds are bigger by three  eighteenths;student:Well it s the same because the half is smaller and it s  different because um this one it only ta the little box are  only um two three four there s only six of them and here s  there s eighteen and this the thirds are bigger by three  eighteenths,4
teacher:Got an answer of 18;student:And then he multiplied another one for the chocolate and then he got the answer18,4
teacher:Okay a total of 9 cups;student:But the question said that in all they had 9 cups only,4
teacher:Jessica thinks it is;student:It is,4
teacher:Okay so if it makes three of them would make one whole;student:Because if you put three of them it makes one whole,4
teacher:Danielle thinks no;student:No,4
teacher:Well you find that you are consistent you do get one sixth when   you use both models;student:It s sort of like one sixth in both cases,4
teacher:You agree with them;student:Um yes,4
teacher:You say one half is bigger;student:One half,4
teacher:I can call it one fifth;student:One fifth,4
teacher:Brian says three sixths;student:Three sixths,4
teacher:Six twelfths I think we have;student:There are six twelfths,4
teacher:We have one half;student:No I was going to say one half,4
teacher:Six twelfths;student:Six,4
teacher:You think it is;student:Yes,4
teacher:And that would be called one;student:And this would be called one,4
teacher:One half;student:A half,4
teacher:Keep the 0;student:Im gonna shift all the numbers downwards so I can get rid of the 0,4
teacher:So youre saying that one half of the one sixth is another way of  saying one twelfth;student:Theres just half of one theres just half of one,4
teacher:Shes calling one white one twelfth;student:No Im not Im calling it one twelfth,4
teacher:You mean yeah the two thirds are bigger by three eighteenths;student:Well it s the same because the half is smaller and it s different  because um this one it only ta the little box are only um two three  four there s only six of them and here s there s eighteen and this  the thirds are bigger by three eighteenths,4
teacher:It wouldnt fit in it;student:Well it wouldnt fit,4
teacher:You wouldnt measure them the same;student:You re not measuring the same,4
teacher:The children are bigger than the boat;student:The children are bigger,4
teacher:You really didnt;student:No,4
teacher:This person weightlifted and burned 200 calories;student:It represents the 200 calories you burned when you weightlifted,4
teacher:I would give it the number name one third;student:One third,4
teacher:So if they only had the 2 cups of chocolate here youre saying he would have had 7 cups of cream,4
teacher:Well dark blue;student:Dark blue,4
teacher:Okay so I called the light green one third and I called the red one  third;student:Um well oh you take a light green and that ll be a third of it,4
teacher:Okay So the student misunderstood this part;student:I think the problem is long and he misunderstood the question I think he only thought that it was both cups combined,4
teacher:You see that in this one more than you see it in this one 3 for Valerie and 1 for Cindy;student:3 more for Valerie 1 for Cindy,4
teacher:3 and Cindy will get 1 of them;student:Like in one column it contains in one row it contains 4 candies,4
teacher:And that gave you 8;student:8,4
teacher:Michelle thinks 16;student:16,4
teacher:One blue and two blues;student:Two blue,4
teacher:And a blue on top,4
teacher:Or from this tower Im going to put a red on the top;student:Or red,4
teacher:So what youre what youre telling me here if I could if I  could make my picture if I were doing what Milin asked me  to do where we had a blue and red what hes telling me to  do is hes saying from this tower Im going to put a blue on  the top;student:Then I put a blue because theres only 2 colors and I all  ready,4
teacher:Right put another blue,4
teacher:Redbluered;student:No thats red,4
teacher:Thats what Jeff wants to know;student:Thats what I want to know,4
teacher:Write 8 down;student:It would be 8,4
teacher:You did it;student:So did I,4
teacher:About the tower;student:About the towers,4
teacher:Just three;student:Three wholes,4
teacher:Or if the orange rod is considered if the red rod is one fifth what  would the orange rod be;student:If if the red rod was considered one fifth what,4
teacher:Laura says Im going to call the red rod one;student:The red,4
teacher:Youd call it four,4
teacher:One fourth;student:Fourths,4
teacher:And then white;student:Um light green then red and white,4
teacher:No the color names dont change;student:No,4
teacher:No the number names change thats very important when using  these rods;student:No,4
teacher:Erik thinks that the color names don t change;student:Color names no,4
teacher:Okay measure that was the first operation;student:We measure,4
teacher:Shes calling one white one twelfth;student:No Im not Im calling it one twelfth,4
teacher:You think the same as Meredith;student:Um well I think the same as Meredith,4
teacher:One half of course;student:One half,4
teacher:And that is four;student:Four minus three times two in parenthesis squared is equal to four minus six all raised to the second power and that equals four,4
teacher:Is equal to four;student:Four minus three in parenthesis times two squared is equal to one times four is four,4
teacher:Is 100;student:Four plus three times two in parenthesis raised to the second power is equal to 100,4
teacher:And that equals 28;student:Four plus three in parenthesis times two squared is equal to seven times two squared and that is 28,4
teacher:Yes so draw the triangle again;student:So now we get a rightangled triangle A C G,4
teacher:The length of the wall diagonal;student:A wall diagonal,4
teacher:Uh huh yes mark the right angle there so its clear;student:walls A B C D  a short diagonal to the right,4
teacher:So you meant a wall not a side a wall yes so walls A B C and D we can use;student:So we will separate it on one side to A B C and well mark it as a rightangled triangle,4
teacher:So lets start with a sketch;student:So Im going to make a sketch,4
teacher:Transferred to centimeters;student:I transferred it,4
teacher:Yes its twentyseven point six;student:It is twentyseven point six,4
teacher:Sides;student:So diagonals are split into halves with the help of the Pythagorean theorem well figure out the length of each side,4
teacher:Thirteen or 12;student:I had 13,4
teacher:Thirtythree point three for Peter;student:Its thirtythree point three three,4
teacher:Frequency means how many;student:What does it mean by frequency,4
teacher:Youll find most people across the world do the unitary method but you might want to write it that way if you like,4
teacher:Unitary;student:Yeah that one,4
teacher:A hundred and fifty we already know because thats fivesevenths of 210 150;student:A hundred and fifty,4
teacher:No;student:Probably not,4
teacher:So a ratio of losers to winners of five to six,4
teacher:So the ratio of five to six is winners to losers;student:Um five in six are losers and the shop has 121 Mars Bars how many Mars Bars are losers,4
teacher:Three boxes;student:Three were  and eight,4
teacher:Three point five uh huh,4
teacher:One twentyone divided in the ratio;student:She had  because I did 121 divided by 65,4
teacher:No no well just calculate today not draw;student:Well well draw it,4
teacher:Mixed number and now Id like a simple fraction;student:Mixed,4
teacher:The radius is half of the diameter so here I can use the diameter once again Ill write three times two times R;student:The radius is half of the diameter,4
teacher:But the more angles we have the more likely it will start to look like a circumference;student:But more of the angles,4
teacher:Dodecagon correct;student:Dodecagon,4
teacher:Well I used the radius;student:Radius of the circumference,4
teacher:Not the triangle,4
teacher:Its not a linear equation its a segment;student:Linear equation,4
teacher:Yes so this will be the length of the square;student:Length of the square,4
teacher:By two correct;student:By two,4
teacher:Perimeter which we mark as O,4
teacher:Twentyseven eighths so I have an assignment for you;student:Twentyseven,4
teacher:You could write it in a fraction form for me;student:Dont transcribe it into a fraction,4
teacher:No they are not necessary;student:They are not,4
teacher:Multiplying is commutative;student:Because its commutative,4
teacher:One hundred and thirty;student:Fifteen times nine is 135 and its a product of numbers 15 and nine,4
teacher:Twelve plus three and the answer we multiply it by five;student:First we calculate the parenthesis which is 12 plus three,4
teacher:First were going to calculate the fourth powers and later the answers well subtract;student:First were going to calculate the fourth power,4
teacher:With the power which means with the process which were going to be using for calculating as the last one;student:With the power,4
teacher:First we have to do the calculation in parenthesis and after that raise it to a certain power;student:Put it in the parenthesis,4
teacher:Dividing so these are the basic functions and of course thats not enough and unfortunately well have more difficult ones;student:Dividing,4
teacher:Multiplying or by;student:Multiplying,4
teacher:Sixteen so we all have it we all know it,4
teacher:Bigger smaller;student:Fill in the blanks the correct answers of signs for bigger and smaller,4
teacher:One thats correct;student:One,4
teacher:This isnt a complex fraction;student:This is a complex fraction,4
teacher:Two twelfths;student:One twelfth two twelfths,4
teacher:Eleven boxes shares piles whatever you want to call it;student:Eleven,4
teacher:Five and seven in the second one;student:Five,4
teacher:And then joined them;student:The arc on the arc on angle C and then join the interval,4
teacher:Yes and the right angle so you had two sides and a right angle and then joined them;student:And it was a right angle,4
teacher:You dont have to do the measurements,4
teacher:Yeah whats a con congruent triangles are triangles that have the sa exactly the same sides three sides are equal and three angles are equal,4
teacher:Angles so thats all you so try that;student:The length of the line oh no the angles,4
teacher:You ha yeah you use your protractor and your compass to draw the triangle;student:Do you draw the triangle like this,4
teacher:Just one triangle;student:So you want us to draw one triangle,4
teacher:D and B equals E;student:D,4
teacher:Same angles and same sides so were doing 10 quick questions on this;student:Same angles same sides,4
teacher:Yeah;student:Yep,4
teacher:Okay so exterior angles would be a good thing to add in there;student:Exterior angles,4
teacher:You actually start at this point thats already there,4
teacher:You create one ray Let me get rid of this and start again,4
teacher:You can get six of them because there are six sides to extend;student:Six,4
teacher:Yes it certainly does;student:Yes,4
teacher:Oh straight;student:Straight,4
teacher:Mm oh thats enclosed;student:Any twoD shape which is enclosed,4
teacher:Okay weve got quadrilateral;student:Quadrilateral,4
teacher:Okay convex;student:Convex,4
teacher:Five times  ok Meredith said she did five    times ten equals fifty;student:I did five  times ten equals fifty,4
teacher:Ok so youre going to call the white the  number name five;student:If we call the white cube five then it would  equal up to fifty,4
teacher:Okay well just call them one and ten;student:If ten of these  equals one of these   then one of these  could be  one whole because and then ten of these  would ten wholes,4
teacher:Yeah I called that a ten;student:Ok but but didnt you call this  a   ten,4
teacher:Yes;student:Yeah,4
teacher:Three piles all together and I want you to stack them up so you have three piles;student:Three,4
teacher:So you had the same thing you had a right angle and two sides;student:Number three I then joined the both ends up with the right angle triangle,4
teacher:All the sides yeah;student:All the same sides and angles,4
teacher:Okay so you might go up and say uh twos 22 24 26 28 30 all the way up to 44;student:Yep 22,4
teacher:You could start at 22 and go to 43 all Im saying is that you know;student:Oh so it doesnt have to be  22,4
teacher:Draw in the box yeah;student:Um do we just draw a line,4
teacher:No so all pieces of data that are in that lower range are in play;student:No,4
teacher:Fourteen pieces;student:Fourteen,4
teacher:Sigma F good;student:That the um total that the last number in the cumulative frequency table is equal to sigma F Is equal to the sigma F,4
teacher:Four four multiplied by itself three times;student:Four by four by four,4
teacher:Sixtyfour X cubed;student:Sixtyfour,4
teacher:A A S or S A A yep;student:A A S,4
teacher:They could be different lengths so I could have another one exactly the same only smaller with the same three angles;student:Because theyll be different lengths,4
teacher:They have to add up to 90 degrees but if I define the three angles will I get congruent triangles;student:Has those two angles have to add up to 90 degrees,4
teacher:Its like the two sides and angle only the angle this time is 90;student:The two sides and an angle,4
teacher:Youve got the bisecting one;student:Like the bisecting ones,4
teacher:The length of the sides;student:The length,4
teacher:All right so its the two sides of the angle yes,4
teacher:Right so you draw a line 60 degrees here;student:And then 60 degrees,4
teacher:Yep;student:Oh yeah,4
teacher:Both of them are three;student:I dont know the compa yeah thatd be three centimeters,4
teacher:Yeah so its its that line and that line drawing that angle;student:Yeah,4
teacher:Bisecting means to cut it in half;student:Whats the difference between bisect and,4
teacher:Bisect oh you mean intersecting;student:Draw an arc from H bisecting arc from X to form point N,4
teacher:From A yep;student:From A,4
teacher:All sides;student:Um sides,4
teacher:Theyre all the same;student:No theyre all the same,4
teacher:Pythagorean theorem eh;student:The Pythagorean theorem,4
teacher:Interior angle;student:Interior,4
teacher:You calculated this;student:We calculated this,4
teacher:They are thinking that the yellow and the green are one when  they do that;student:One,4
teacher:You couldn t get it out;student:I just couldn t it out,4
teacher:One and one fourth I don t know if I understand that;student:It would be one and one fourth,4
teacher:Laura says two;student:Two,4
teacher:The dark brown would have the number name one;student:No I mean um the dark brown would be one,4
teacher:One and three fourths;student:Because well if you had one and one fourth,4
teacher:Some of you said it would go in the middle,4
teacher:Some of you think we need to call it three fourths and some of you think you need to call it one and one half;student:You would have to call it one and one half,4
teacher:Yeah but right now these models whether they are the Cuisenaire Rods or the ruler what mathematicians do is they take some idea and they build a model of the idea;student:It goes on and on if you could build a model,4
teacher:I m not saying divide the line,4
teacher:That s true we re working with halves;student:We re working with halves,4
teacher:Now you need to move it a little bit more over to the one;student:Now you need to move it more over towards the one,4
teacher:It sure is hard to explain,4
teacher:We have infinitely many;student:Infinitely many,4
teacher:Ok so you are changing your answer to one quarter or two eighths;student:Well this was one quarter and all these were one quarter and these  two together make up a quarter,4
teacher:Laura thinks it s one tenth;student:One tenth,4
teacher:A red okay I didn t think I asked that clearly;student:Oh um a red,4
teacher:It can be one sixth either way;student:Yeah I know we said any one sixth is right,4
teacher:So youre saying then that 16;student:So that would leave that that would be 6,4
teacher:Ok Erik says that 1 and 12 over 12  represent the same number or the same  amount;student:Yes,4
teacher:So I could also rewrite this youre  saying then as 12 over 12,4
teacher:So then youre telling me that how many  112s are in 1 is 12,4
teacher:I think you are doing it between zero and one;student:I think that well are you doing it between zero and two,4
teacher:Okay Jackie says she would cut it right down the middle  here right for a half;student:Cut it right down the middle,4
teacher:Four out of twelve;student:Um four,4
teacher:The person who got half a candy  bar got more than the person who got a third,4
teacher:You say three you say three  it works;student:Three is not going to work,4
teacher:Now various people are saying three;student:Three,4
teacher:Seventeen so all we got to do is try one and seventeen and see what happens;student:One and seventeen,4
teacher:One might work;student:One,4
teacher:Six here and a two here,4
teacher:Okay so that was legal and it produced a false statement,4
teacher:Two and to keep track of it this is often called the truth set and I am going to write it here;student:Two,4
teacher:Five okay I write 5 in the box so it says three plus five equals five and I take it that we agree that is false;student:Uh five,4
teacher:Between zero and one;student:zero and one,4
teacher:OK so we have one half plus  one half equals one whole two fourths plus two fourths  equals one whole or two fourths plus two fourths equals  four fourths equals one whole;student:Its true that one half plus one half equals one whole but  two fourths plus two fourths equals four fourths which is one  whole,4
teacher:So were calling this the two oranges together one;student:Ok the two oranges make the whole,4
teacher:So were calling this the two oranges together one;student:Ok the two oranges make the whole,4
teacher:And two brown rods;student:And two browns,4
teacher:Two browns to be one third;student:I took two browns and put them together,4
teacher:Twentyfour also;student:Twentyfour,4
teacher:Andrew has twentyfour;student:Um twentyfour whites,4
teacher:Youre imagining twentyfour;student:Twentyfour,4
teacher:Brian thinks then white ones in the next train would be one  twentyfourth;student:Um one twentyfourth I think,4
teacher:Were all the same length;student:Were the same length,4
teacher:Alan thinks one sixth;student:One sixth,4
teacher:It s a red bigger,4
teacher:The half is bigger;student:The half,4
teacher:No it s not really fair;student:No,4
teacher:Are in one right you have it;student:A whole,4
teacher:She would call it 112 she says;student:I would call it 112,4
teacher:Ok so the green is one sixteenth;student:One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven  twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen,4
teacher:So we have one twelfth we have four fortyeighths;student:One twelfth,4
teacher:Might see some words you might see some numbers yeah;student:words,4
teacher:We might see some number sentences;student:Number sentences,4
teacher:Labels wait;student:Labels,4
teacher:So a detective looks for clues and they solve mysteries,4
teacher:Square units;student:You would have to square,4
teacher:But you re not really saying length  equals volume because that doesn t make any sense because  we know the length of this;student:Length equals volume,4
teacher:So cube units;student:Two units,4
teacher:Okay you all say 14,4
teacher:Hell have three like dad right  interesting;student:I know what hes saying he would have three more like dad,4
teacher:No so lets rethink that for a moment please;student:No,4
teacher:Yes he does;student:Yes,4
teacher:Five and thats what you had down on your paper;student:One two three four five,4
teacher:Alice said theres four and four;student:Theres 4 and 4,4
teacher:Ok so you said there was a rule like this you  found the secret twelve divided by one third you  found that by multiplying twelve times three and  getting thirtysix;student:Um I said I um multiplied either um  one third two third six or two to twelve and I got the  answer,4
teacher:So they know where to put the brackets;student:Well so they could know where to put  the brackets,4
teacher:They marked the thirds first;student:Well the um the thirds,4
teacher:Twelve twelve meter lengths;student:Twelve,4
teacher:James thinks eleven;student:I think eleven,4
teacher:Brian thinks thirteen;student:Thirteen,4
teacher:Andrew thinks ten;student:Wait no ten,4
teacher:Andrew thinks eleven;student:um Eleven,4
teacher:Laura thinks twelve;student:Twelve,4
teacher:Three thirds of a meter in each meter;student:I meant three thirds,4
teacher:Answer very good;student:Answer,4
teacher:You checked it out and it does work;student:It s four boys,4
teacher:No okay;student:No,4
teacher:At the very bottom;student:At the bottom,4
teacher:You mean four fortyeighths;student:Four fortyeighths,4
teacher:We know its one twelfth weve proved its one twelfth and youve  proved its one twelfth;student:One twelfth,4
teacher:Ok David thinks four twelfths;student:Four twelfths,4
teacher:Thats one name one twelfth;student:One twelfth,4
teacher:One twelfth or two  twentyfourths,4
teacher:By two twentyfourths or by one twelfth;student:Or it could be bigger by two twentyfourths,4
teacher:Oh three six nine;student:See we drew shirts and since each one of them can go to  three pairs of jeans three six nine,4
teacher:Because they already have one red;student:And then these three  all get a blue added on to it,4
teacher:So this has to be a one red,4
teacher:So this your going from three blue to one blue;student:Three,4
teacher:I see so there is something to do with sixteen minus eight;student:And when you take one away from each it would  be one minus one minus one minus because its sixteen  minus eight or eight plus eight,4
teacher:Eight of them then;student:Eight,4
teacher:Taking one off changed the  answer to eight,4
teacher:Okay What I hear Stephanie and Dana are saying is if you  can take one away it doesnt change;student:Its gonna be  one less,4
teacher:There would be sixteen if there were four;student:There would be sixteen,4
teacher:Okay Brian and Jeff think they would be the same;student:We think its the same,4
teacher:Okay so this one is all red and that one is red blue and red;student:Its got red blue and red,4
teacher:You think there would be more than sixteen;student:I think higher,4
teacher:You think there would be more also;student:More,4
teacher:So three candies would be an odd number of candies,4
teacher:Okay those are really different from each other;student:Because this color and this color is different from this color  and this color and this color and this color and this color,4
teacher:There is a number sentence;student:They have a number sentence,4
teacher:You see numbers;student:I see words I see numbers,4
teacher:With respect;student:Respect,4
teacher:He says right away that two will work and Jeff says a one hundred will work;student:How about a hundred,4
teacher:You know the second answer to eight;student:I know the second answer to eight,4
teacher:Romina says three;student:Three,4
teacher:We don t have a two thousandths;student:What I did is that I noticed that two thousandths is not bigger,4
teacher:All right 781;student:781,4
teacher:Right the dollar sign remember when you are dealing with money you have to put the dollar sign otherwise its just a number;student:Some people didnt put the money sign,4
teacher:A dollar sign we are adding the dollar sign to this and all that  the dollar sign we are adding the dollar sign thats all were doing;student:A dollar sign,4
teacher:Thats right two and seven 10th next round to the nearest 100th everybody look at what they wrote if you have 1000th place there erase it all right show;student:Because you have to round this to the nearest 10th and at the 100th place theres a five and five is more I forgot what is the word and that now you make it into two and seven 10th,4
teacher:10th dont worry about that;student:10th,4
teacher:Im 10 away;student:10,4
teacher:Okay so ice cream shop lets put a star;student:The ice cream shop,4
teacher:So post office,4
teacher:13 blocks;student:13,4
teacher:Park entrance to the pizzaria;student:Wait were supposed to go to the park,4
teacher:11 11 blocks;student:11,4
teacher:One two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11;student:No 11,4
teacher:Theres one and thats 11;student:11,4
teacher:Zero zero so that is where you have to start;student:0 0,4
teacher:She drew 4 circles and then counted up to 56 and then counted her 14 dots in each circle,4
teacher:Sheila says Lauren;student:Lauren,4
teacher:Six so there is already one there;student:Six,4

teacher:give me one,5
teacher:Alexa give me one,5
teacher:What do you notice about the numerator and denominator,5
teacher:How about this one,5
teacher:If I had 1 2 3 4 5 If I had 25 if I multiply the parts by 2 this is the Deane as 25 times what,5
teacher:Then Im multiplying by what,5
teacher:You guys want to help me,5
teacher:The 1 is always in the form of what;student:Yes,5
teacher:Where the,5
teacher:Clay what is a relational symbol,5
teacher:What is that,5
teacher:Multiply a number by;student:Multiply a fraction it gets smaller,5
teacher:We get 410 so therefore 25 actually Ill do this equals 410 and then what if I do this;student:Yes,5
teacher:Does anybody remember what that word means,5
teacher:What does it mean to develop something,5
teacher:Nice so we know that the word of especially in this case means;student:I knew of is multiplication,5
teacher:Whats a coordinate grid,5
teacher:What are you going to do,5
teacher:In other words tell your shoulder partner what are you going to do,5
teacher:We have an Xaxis and a row of the Yaxis and then what,5

teacher:What would be a simile for greater than;student:No,5
teacher:How do you know that the answer is no Sophia,5
teacher:What do you know;student:Because of 45x950,5
teacher:How do you know that this expression is less than 45x9,5
teacher:How do you know its yes Nessa,5
teacher:Okay so the answer is yes and how do we know that is yes,5
teacher:Youre comparing it to;student:No youre multiplying that number that you get,5
teacher:By;student:Yes,5
teacher:Youre multiplying it by what;student:By multiplying,5
teacher:Tell me that word,5
teacher:Asher how do you know,5
teacher:Clay how do you know that the answer is no,5

teacher:What are some other ways that you would use enlarge,5
teacher:34 by;student:34,5
teacher:What did you draw here,5
teacher:Christoph can you come up and show us what the new coordinates are,5
teacher:Tera will you come up and show us your list,5
teacher:What could you do to prove that,5
teacher:Yes and,5
teacher:What can you add to that Erin,5
teacher:If you just looked at the picture how could you use the picture to explain how the two are different,5
teacher:How could you use the picture to explain,5
teacher:How would you know that it was twice as wide;student:You could show how it looked before and how it looked after,5
teacher:What happened in the sailboat when you didnt plot them in order,5
teacher:Tobin what happened if you didnt plot them in order,5
teacher:So make sure that you connect the points and then compare your prediction in problem two to the new picture how was your prediction correct and how was your prediction incorrect;student:Yes,5
teacher:Youre talking about what you predicted and youre comparing how it was to how the picture actually turned out,5
teacher:The hardest part is the explaining part so what is it that youre going to be explaining in the problem,5
teacher:Are there any questions about what a rule is,5
teacher:Whats is Jakes goal,5
teacher:Whats it not telling you Missy,5
teacher:Whats missing,5
teacher:How could you prove that you doubled the width,5
teacher:So it was twice as wide and what about the height;student:Yes,5
teacher:What about the width;student:The width,5
teacher:How can you describe in specific words how the second trapezoid is different than the first,5
teacher:What is this coordinate;student:Yes,5
teacher:What is the name of this coordinate,5
teacher:So if you double the first coordinate what is that going to be;student:Yes,5
teacher:The next one was  so you doubled it and it should be,5
teacher:Okay so then if you plot those wheres,5
teacher:What are you doing up there,5
teacher:So if you plot  wheres;student:Okay,5
teacher:What would be some substitute words for greater than,5
teacher:would be,5
teacher:The X coordinate is always listed first or second,5
teacher:Kimberly is the Y coordinate listed first or second,5
teacher:If you double the first coordinate what do you got,5
teacher:Are you doubling both of them or are you supposed to just double the first one,5
teacher:What happened to the 000 in the new trapezoid when you applied the rule,5
teacher:What happened to the 000,5
teacher:How is the new trapezoid different,5
teacher:Okay and then;student:Here,5
teacher:What are the two possibilities,5
teacher:Missy if you have the expression greater than 45x9 so your answer is going to be what,5
teacher:The other thing is if you dont understand something it is,5
teacher:Okay so how much bigger;student:I think it is going to be bigger because it said you have to double the original number,5
teacher:What is a conjecture;student:Conjecture,5
teacher:Whats a conjecture,5
teacher:I guess yes or a;student:A guess,5
teacher:Where would that be,5
teacher:Zero times anything is,5

teacher:The answer is x equals what,5
teacher:After how many minutes will an AMV be on two adjacent turns of a square  after how many minutes,5
teacher:You are almost there but you need to think about how you solved and got the 16 how did you get the 16,5
teacher:Its one here so what does this need to be,5
teacher:If its one here what does this need to be,5
teacher:If this is two here what does this need to be,5
teacher:What does that need to connect with to look like the other one;student:Yes,5

teacher:How did you know that,5
teacher:How did we know that the red was 47 hundredths,5
teacher:Okay so the four columns means what;student:There were four columns and the,5
teacher:The seven is;student:Theres a,5
teacher:Seven what;student:The seven is seven,5
teacher:What,5
teacher:If we were to add how do we know that the six tenths is correct,5
teacher:How do we know that the six tenths is correct,5
teacher:How do you know that the six tenths is correct,5

teacher:The four goes in the what place,5
teacher:What does represent mean,5
teacher:What did you guys all agree,5
teacher:In this case what does each of these columns represent,5
teacher:Talk to your neighbors in this case what does each of those columns represent,5
teacher:What does each of these columns represent,5
teacher:Specifically what does this column represent,5
teacher:I would like Would somebody like to share the first problem their grid for the first problem,5
teacher:So if one column is a tenth what is one square,5
teacher:Then we also have Oops we should have What is going on here,5
teacher:When we explain what am I looking for in an explanation,5
teacher:I want you to practice using them or what happens when you dont use words,5

teacher:What do you notice,5
teacher:Now I need to split it into what,5
teacher:How much of those thirds did I eat,5
teacher:Ive split it in half now what do I need to do,5
teacher:What do I need to do to my paper now,5
teacher:Edwin whats 2 x 3;student:Oh 2,5
teacher:What is this showing us,5
teacher:What do you notice about this picture,5
teacher:Calvin how do we find the answer,5
teacher:We have a half of 34 so what does that tell us we have,5
teacher:Now Im going to have If I had half a pizza and I ate 34 of that pizza how much did I eat,5
teacher:What part of a whole fruit bar will he give to his brother,5
teacher:Tell me what do you notice,5
teacher:When you see fractions of fractions what do you think we will be doing Rachel,5
teacher:What do you notice,5
teacher:What does this half turn into,5
teacher:Jaden what did you notice,5
teacher:This is his brother so his brother gets how much of the fruit bar,5
teacher:Eva had 12 of a veggie pizza she eats 23 of the part of the pizza she has how much of the whole pizza did she eat,5
teacher:What do we need to do first with our paper,5
teacher:Overall how much pizza did she eat of the whole,5
teacher:Jaden whats 1 x 2,5
teacher:So what did you notice this half turned into,5
teacher:Zoey when I talk about how the placement of the decimal point will change the language would be I think that the decimal point will move either to the right by however many or to the left so is the decimal point on the four going to move to the right or to the left when you multiply it by 10 square,5
teacher:You don t have to think about balancing a bank statement but what do you think when you have to balance Anders,5
teacher:Felicia can you bring your board to the front and show everyone and explain your thinking,5

teacher:How old are you;student:Hes 14,5
teacher:How would we figure that out,5
teacher:How do we do that,5
teacher:Her;student:Twelve,5
teacher:Count down from eight because if Lilith is eight we would count back how many;student:One way that we can do it is to count up from eight  or count down,5
teacher:When Lilith is;student:Seven,5
teacher:When Lilith is;student:Five,5
teacher:Its onefourth of what my friends,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:Can anyone help us figure out what is that asking,5
teacher:Does anybody have another way to think about it,5
teacher:Collin tell us about what youre thinking,5
teacher:I just wanted you to tell us what youre doing,5
teacher:Left over;student:One and onefourth,5
teacher:What is this information telling us,5

teacher:Andrea lets have you share and then were going to move on to the next part,5
teacher:What does it mean the first coordinate;student:No,5
teacher:When we make a rule about what,5
teacher:How will we know were successful,5
teacher:We will know were successful when we make a rule about what,5
teacher:How old will Lilith be,5
teacher:What numbers are you doing right now friends,5
teacher:Are you working with a partner or by yourself,5

teacher:What do you notice about the factors,5
teacher:What is the answer,5
teacher:What is that though,5
teacher:What is estimation,5
teacher:Talk to your face partner about what estimation means,5
teacher:What is estimation,5
teacher:Will you please talk to your face partner about what strategy you used to figure this one out,5
teacher:Alve can you come show us what you did,5
teacher:Okay so tell us about this strategy,5
teacher:What does estimation mean,5
teacher:If I double all the X coordinates where am I going to drag my coordinates to,5
teacher:Okay what else Mariah,5
teacher:Where is the decimal go,5
teacher:Okay so we could round 76 to what,5
teacher:Oh okay so youre going to roundup then to do what,5
teacher:So we can multiply 76 times 10 and what is that,5
teacher:If that is our estimate where are we going to put the decimal,5
teacher:Where would you put the decimal,5
teacher:The answer is seven  Okay so how are you going to estimate this one,5
teacher:189 is close to what number,5
teacher:I think big round numbers that are really easy to multiply so I would round this to 200 and I multiply 175 is close to what number,5
teacher:Okay so 200 and 175 is close to what answer,5
teacher:200 times two is,5
teacher:Two times two is what,5
teacher:What is this thing doing,5
teacher:Okay so were going to put place value what,5
teacher:What do you think Pairs Compare might be,5
teacher:Youll start with  My thinking about number two is  what,5
teacher:Which way,5
teacher:Okay so how many place values total;student:Yes,5
teacher:So in this problem Im going to multiply this by what,5
teacher:So heres what I want you to do I want you to think what power of 10 do I need to multiply these by in order to make them a number that I can multiply,5
teacher:One good way to figure out where the decimal goes is to do what,5
teacher:How can you figure out where the decimal goes on any of these,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:Clay what does that mean if Im going to multiply these making them into whole numbers,5
teacher:What am I going to multiply;student:Wait you multiply them,5
teacher:Okay so what would that be;student:You are only going to multiply the whole numbers,5
teacher:Enrique what are the steps,5
teacher:What about the questions,5
teacher:First youre going to,5
teacher:Now youre going to;student:Multiply the whole numbers,5
teacher:Yes so youre going to multiply0 what are you going to multiply;student:Ignore the decimals,5
teacher:Then third;student:I get it,5
teacher:Whats the third thing youre going to do Lisa,5
teacher:How did you do that,5
teacher:All right so will you talk us through it,5
teacher:First step was,5
teacher:Second youre going to;student:Estimate,5
teacher:Looking at this what does it mean to balance,5
teacher:Jace can you tell me what you and your partner talked about,5
teacher:Then where do you think I should drag D to;student:Yes,5
teacher:Without doing this gain what does it show I have leftover,5
teacher:Okay so the five needs to become what,5
teacher:And I need to carry the one over to;student:A four,5
teacher:12 minus four is,5
teacher:Show me on your fingers class,5

teacher:The four is in the what place,5
teacher:The nine is in the;student:Tenths,5
teacher:Explain your thinking when looking at this,5
teacher:So what does it show i have left over,5
teacher:568;student:Then I just went on to five tenths six hundredths and eight thousands and got 37 and 568 thousandths,5
teacher:Next,5
teacher:Who can explain to me how where to start in this subtraction problem,5
teacher:Talk to your table what do you have leftover,5
teacher:What is the difference,5
teacher:Meaning difference meaning what,5
teacher:What is the difference,5
teacher:Difference meaning answer to a Class,5
teacher:What do I have leftover;student:Subtraction problem,5
teacher:Vertically means Tell me with your arm what does vertically mean,5
teacher:What do I do,5
teacher:I know its 39 hundredths its not nine so what do I need to do,5
teacher:10  9,5
teacher:6  3;student:One,5
teacher:My answer is still;student:Three,5
teacher:Minus subtracting 14;student:Yes,5
teacher:Now what do you need to do,5
teacher:First step who would like to explain to me,5

teacher:What do we think partialsums mean;student:Division problem,5
teacher:With what,5
teacher:Logan number one please,5
teacher:How can you tell,5
teacher:Wheres your mistake that youre realizing;student:What I did for problem two was I added 6  8 to get 14 and then I had to go to tenths place so I added four and seven and wait I just realized thats,5
teacher:What would the answer be if you put a one in the tenths place;student:Now that I realize it because I know 7  3 is like a whole so I forgot an extra yes like a one in the tenths place,5
teacher:Now looking at this next problem twenty one and thirty seven hundredths is this closer to 21 or 22,5
teacher:21 plus now 21  10 is;student:Its closer to 21,5
teacher:We see 7 in the tenths place and we know were rounding the ones place so the 3 rounds up to what,5
teacher:Show me with your fingers,5
teacher:Missy what number is in the tenths place,5
teacher:If were rounding up the tenth place Sophia what did you look at to know if you should round up or keep it the same,5
teacher:Lets have Laura explain how you got the answer for rounding to the nearest tenth,5
teacher:Class what numbers in the thousandths place,5
teacher:Is our thousandths place nine going to stay the same or move up,5

teacher:Comment Antony,5
teacher:What number is in the tenths place,5
teacher:How do we say this,5
teacher:Can you think of problems where you have had to solve with a rule,5
teacher:Its the same thing as saying what,5
teacher:Yes you have to do a certain thing so applying a rule in math might mean what;student:To apply something,5
teacher:No so then;student:No,5
teacher:How many times;student:Yes,5
teacher:Then,5
teacher:Then,5
teacher:6  6;student:Subtract,5
teacher:Wait a minute what does that mean onehalf dozen,5
teacher:Courtney what does that mean;student:Half dozens,5
teacher:Courtney has that background knowledge that a dozen equals how many Courtney;student:A dozen means 12 and half a dozen is six because 6  6 is 12,5

teacher:One morning Albert collected 151 eggs how many cartons did he need for the eggs,5
teacher:What do we know for certain in this problem,5
teacher:How many cartons will he need,5
teacher:Okay so what do you guys think about this,5
teacher:Okay how would we make it better,5
teacher:What is the question asking you to figure out,5
teacher:6 x 2 is;student:No two,5
teacher:What is the actual question that youre trying to find;student:Partially filled tray,5
teacher:First divide second,5
teacher:What do I have now;student:Divide then youll dive 6   6,5
teacher:So 300 sixes is equal to what;student:Sixes,5
teacher:How many sixes can I put into 1926;student:300  10  10  1 is 321,5
teacher:How many sixes can I fit into 1926;student:You said how many what,5
teacher:How many sixes can I fit into 1926,5

teacher:Whats first,5
teacher:How many times;student:Yes,5
teacher:Albany how many times can I fit 6 into 19,5
teacher:Okay now;student:Then you will get one,5
teacher:Whats fourth,5
teacher:Now;student:You bring down,5
teacher:All right Albany what am dividing,5
teacher:Valerie do you know,5
teacher:Well what is the question;student:I need a credit card,5
teacher:How many carrots are on the partially filled tray;student:Yes I do not agree,5
teacher:What happens to them,5
teacher:The question is how many carrots are left partially filled trays,5
teacher:If we read this what are we doing,5
teacher:What is it asking us to solve,5
teacher:How do we know its asking us 47 divided by 6;student:47 divide by 6,5
teacher:Whats my mistake Tiffany,5
teacher:Whats one method we could use to solve this problem,5
teacher:6 x 3,5
teacher:How many 6s can I fit into 47,5
teacher:What is 67 Mathias,5
teacher:No so what does that tell me five is;student:No,5
teacher:Is there another way I could have solved this problem,5
teacher:Is there another way I could have solved this problem,5
teacher:Mohammad how did you start solving this problem,5
teacher:Now we know our answer we know that I can fill how many full trays,5
teacher:What happens to those five,5
teacher:So whats our remainder,5
teacher:If we have 42 on the trays so far how many do we have left out of 47,5
teacher:How many do we have left,5
teacher:Can you tell me what youre doing,5
teacher:What question should we answer,5
teacher:What is that mean partially filled;student:How many carrots are on the partially filled tray,5
teacher:What did you mean;student:Wait because I wanted to ask Ian,5
teacher:Okay Auden whats your first step when youre solving a problem like that,5
teacher:For a problem like that whats your first step,5
teacher:What is the question;student:The answer is five,5
teacher:How many what;student:How much it takes to get to 1800,5
teacher:47 divided by 6 is asking you to do what;student:With the remainder of five or the answer is five,5
teacher:How many are in each,5
teacher:How many do you have so far then,5
teacher:Then how many carrots are on each tray,5
teacher:How many should we have on all the trays,5
teacher:If we had six here six here six here and six here how many do we have so far,5
teacher:Do you think we can fit another carrot on each tray;student:No were not,5
teacher:Now how many carrots are on those trays;student:6 times six equals,5
teacher:How do you know,5
teacher:What is that 300 again,5
teacher:Okay now what;student:Yes,5
teacher:All right now what;student:Yes,5
teacher:How much of a third tub of jelly,5
teacher:What about 1 15,5
teacher:How many whole tubs of jelly do I have,5
teacher:How many whole tubs of jelly of strawberry jelly do I have,5
teacher:I have one whole tub of jelly because thats my whole number and then how much of another one,5
teacher:All right so if I wanted to just add up what do I have on my screen,5
teacher:How many wholes do I have,5
teacher:How many whole tubs of jelly do I have in my picture,5
teacher:Three so one two three and then how many fifths;student:Three,5
teacher:In 2 351 15 what are my whole numbers,5
teacher:What are my whole numbers in these two Dakotaa,5
teacher:No whole numbers;student:The whole numbers are four and six,5
teacher:What are my whole numbers Anderson,5
teacher:Now do you guys know what two plus one is,5
teacher:What is two plus one;student:Yes,5
teacher:Two wholes and then how much of a third,5
teacher:How many whole tubs of jelly do I have in 2 35,5
teacher:The first way is to draw a picture so if I was going to draw a picture for 2 35 how many whole tubs of jelly do I have in 2 35,5
teacher:We had 2 35 tubs of what kind of jelly,5
teacher:An improper fraction is when the top number is what bigger or smaller;student:fraction,5
teacher:Winston whats bigger nine or four;student:Smaller,5
teacher:Nine so is the top number bigger or smaller;student:Nine,5
teacher:Okay so if I have six fifths how many pieces is my pizza cut into;student:Because the top number it goes more bigger than the pieces that its actually supposed to be,5
teacher:In six fifths how many pieces is my pizza cut into,5
teacher:Five pieces and how many pieces do I eat;student:Five,5
teacher:How many pieces did I eat of these,5
teacher:If Im taking out my fractions and adding them up what am I going to add up,5
teacher:Then how many more;student:Six,5
teacher:Today were going to focusing on what,5
teacher:Were going to be adding numbers that have both fractions and what,5
teacher:No not decimals fractions and what;student:Decimals,5
teacher:Tell someone next to you how you think youd figure this out;student:Okay so how would I figure this out,5
teacher:Adding all the numbers how do you know were going to add,5
teacher:So the cafeteria had how many tubs of grape jelly,5
teacher:How much more;student:One jelly,5
teacher:Okay so improper fraction always greater than what,5
teacher:Seven and then how many carrots are left without a home;student:Seven,5
teacher:No and what is 31;student:No,5
teacher:What are we going to do to figure this out Dana,5
teacher:What are we trying to figure out,5
teacher:What are we trying to figure out in this question,5
teacher:How many did they run it all,5
teacher:What are we trying to figure out,5
teacher:We know those two things what are we trying to figure out,5
teacher:No what is the question asking us to find out;student:Six plus,5
teacher:Number of what;student:The numbers,5
teacher:What are we trying to figure out in this problem Wade,5
teacher:Vance what are we trying to figure out in this problem,5
teacher:How far did each boy run,5
teacher:How are we going to do this,5
teacher:Now that we have what we know and what were trying to figure out what are we going to do to figure out how many miles each boy ran,5
teacher:Divide what;student:You would divide,5
teacher:Hunter can you walk me through it,5
teacher:Because what are we trying to fit into;student:Because it will take forever to complete the problem,5
teacher:What are we trying to figure out,5
teacher:We know therere six boys and what are those boys doing,5
teacher:Whats one thing that we know Casey,5
teacher:Awesome so what do we know;student:If they each ran the same amount of miles how far did each boy run,5
teacher:What are we going to add,5
teacher:How should we do this;student:2 14 and 1 24,5
teacher:Abni will you walk me through what you did,5
teacher:Now those are done what do I have left to add Abni,5
teacher:So 14 plus what;student:One plus two which is the two fractions,5
teacher:How did your fourth turn into a fifth,5
teacher:Now if Im going to draw two and one fourths how many wholes do I have,5
teacher:Bolrom drew a line segment 2 14 inches long then he made the line segment 1 24 inches longer how long is the segment now,5
teacher:How many wholes do I have in 2 14,5
teacher:One two and then Dakotaa how much of another one do I have,5
teacher:What about in 1 24 how many wholes do I have Dana,5
teacher:One and how many of another one do I have Dana;student:One,5
teacher:Two what;student:Two,5
teacher:Out of how many;student:Two on the other end,5
teacher:Yes so that fraction is;student:Four,5
teacher:How many wholes do I have,5
teacher:How many wholes do I have Dakotaa,5
teacher:A fraction but this is a special kind of fraction because which number is bigger the top or the bottom;student:A fraction,5
teacher:Now what is the question asking me for,5
teacher:How do you know that,5
teacher:What should your maximum value be on your ordered value bar graph;student:Wait which one is it,5
teacher:Four and whats the maximum value showing you,5
teacher:Crew in total can you tell me how many people live on this street,5
teacher:How many total people live on this street,5
teacher:Evan what do you think,5
teacher:How many people;student:I think theres seven people,5
teacher:What do you think;student:I disagree,5
teacher:What do you think are the total number of people,5
teacher:Now Evan how many houses do we have,5
teacher:What is 21 divided by 7 crew,5
teacher:How would you finished that;student:I didnt finish that,5
teacher:It says Do you agree with Dog or Cat,5
teacher:Ben can you tell us when you say they counted wrong what do you think they counted wrong;student:The answer is 15 which is the cat and the dog was incorrect because he was,5
teacher:What do you mean by The odd or evens;student:Maybe the odd or evens,5
teacher:Molly you are actually next do you want to read yours sweetie,5
teacher:All right when we look at this here what should your maximum value be,5
teacher:Youre going to have 0 0 0 0 how many 1s,5
teacher:Can I see your slide number one,5
teacher:Landon what are you thinking,5
teacher:How about the mode,5
teacher:Whats the mode,5
teacher:I want you to look at yours and I want you to figure out how many people did they ask the question how many people live in your house,5
teacher:How many people did they ask the question for,5
teacher:Violet how many people got asked that question,5
teacher:How many total household members are there,5
teacher:Once the data was reported how many total household members were there,5
teacher:One sticks Julian what do you think,5
teacher:How did you get that;student:I agree,5
teacher:How many people were sampled Ian,5
teacher:How did you get 18;student:18,5
teacher:How did you get that;student:I think the number is 10,5
teacher:Did anyone count those up and see what you got,5
teacher:Howd you get 10;student:I agree with the number of people,5
teacher:Right now you said yellow which is three red which is two and green which was how many;student:I added yellow which is three and red which is two and green which is five,5
teacher:What now,5
teacher:How many 2s;student:Six,5
teacher:In total Charlotte how many pieces of data do we have,5
teacher:How many would be smaller than the median and how many would be larger,5
teacher:What did you do to find your mean;student:Then 172845,5
teacher:Your median remind me,5
teacher:Thank you and your mean was;student:Four,5
teacher:Which one of these values do you think best represents who he is as a golfer,5
teacher:What do you think Drew,5
teacher:Which of those values over here the mode the median or the mean best represents what kind of golfer Arnold is,5
teacher:Is there one number there that you think doesnt represent him as a golfer,5
teacher:Out of median and mean what do you think,5
teacher:Natalie what do you think,5
teacher:Which one better represents Arnold as a golfer,5
teacher:Sorry out of the median and the mean;student:I think,5
teacher:Okay tell me one thing that you notice about your data Carson,5
teacher:Whats your evidence for that,5
teacher:Evan what do you notice,5
teacher:Whats your evidence;student:That the 6th graders dont watch as many movies as the 7th graders and the 8th graders,5
teacher:What did you get when you added all those together;student:Then I did 639 and I did 181028,5
teacher:Tell me what you did to figure it out;student:What do you mean,5
teacher:Lily what did that look like;student:Oh Lily did,5
teacher:Maya what do you think that the median is,5
teacher:Is anyone else just dying to share their response,5
teacher:Just so you dont die lets hear your response,5
teacher:Carson lets hear yours,5
teacher:We want to know what is the median of this data,5
teacher:What is the median,5
teacher:Tell me what advice you have for the animal who is incorrect,5
teacher:Can you tell us what mistake Dog made,5
teacher:Whats the median,5
teacher:We have how many pieces of data,5
teacher:Show me your hand signal for mode,5
teacher:We need a hand signal for mean what should it be,5
teacher:What do we do when all three of those numbers are different and we still want to have a value that represents what is typical,5
teacher:As you are watching this video I want you to think about What is the typical number of swings that this golfer needs,5
teacher:Hey how can you decide which measure of center to report,5
teacher:GoWyatt what did you say whats the mode,5
teacher:How do you know;student:2,5
teacher:Can you show me your hand signal for median;student:Thats right,5
teacher:When we look at this crew what is the mean for the houses on Elm Street,5
teacher:What would another be to add,5
teacher:What should we move;student:Yes,5
teacher:Its a mouth but its what kind of mouth the bigger or a small mouth;student:Because its shaping like a mouth,5
teacher:Yes so whats about acute angles;student:No a small mouth,5
teacher:What size are they,5
teacher:They are less than Phillip,5
teacher:They are less than 90 degrees so everyone give me an L This is 90 degrees if it is smaller than this it is;student:90 degrees,5
teacher:If it is bigger it is,5
teacher:How to do that,5
teacher:If yours looks like this what is it,5
teacher:All right big angles are bigger than what,5
teacher:There you go so 90 is a what,5
teacher:What is 90 degrees,5
teacher:What should you have on your string,5
teacher:What kind of angle,5
teacher:How are you going to do that,5
teacher:Can you guys tell me what are the two ways that we can find a typical number for a set of data,5
teacher:Right now Mathias Auden what kind of angle have we produced,5
teacher:Who is the vertex right now,5
teacher:Who can tell me what this angle is called,5
teacher:Whittny what else,5
teacher:How many carrots are on the partially filled tray;student:Because it says how many carrots are on the partially filled tray,5
teacher:What does partially mean;student:Whats partially,5
teacher:No so what does partially mean;student:No,5
teacher:Baker why dont you give it a shot what,5
teacher:That means I am going to be looking at my,5
teacher:What part of my question,5
teacher:Im sorry what part of my answer,5
teacher:James do you remember one of them,5
teacher:My remainder because this right here seven remainder five means that I have filled how many full trays;student:Remainder,5
teacher:Who can share how they rewrote this problem,5
teacher:Billie how did you rewrite this problem,5
teacher:Billie will you read your first sentence again,5
teacher:To solve this problem 47 divided by six,5
teacher:What makes this answer better than the one that I had written up there Baker,5
teacher:What are some things that we know about angles Martin;student:Yes,5
teacher:Okay we can measure them what else Tiffany;student:They are something that you use to measure,5
teacher:Its just not going to be a full tray so the answer how many carrots are on the partially filled tray is what,5
teacher:What answer am I looking for Whittny,5
teacher:Can you guys show me your hand signal for median,5
teacher:What do you think Tim,5
teacher:Remind me how many people lived in Brendas house,5
teacher:Earlier you guys told me that the mode You guys remember what you told me what the mode was,5
teacher:Can you think of an equation that matches the situation that we just did,5
teacher:Whats the total number of people on Pirate Street,5
teacher:The total number of people on pirate street,5
teacher:What are you going to divide it by;student:Yes,5
teacher:What do you think could be a common misconception that kids have,5
teacher:What do you guys think,5
teacher:Do we know what the common mistake might be,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:What do you guys think might be another misconception,5
teacher:What do you guys think might be another misconception that somebody might do when they look at line plot,5
teacher:What do you think Claire,5
teacher:What do you think Tim,5
teacher:Do you want to tell us what we should move;student:Can I follow this,5
teacher:What did we figure out might be a nice household size,5
teacher:Nathan what do you think,5
teacher:Who would like to say what we could do next,5
teacher:Charlotte who could we move first,5
teacher:Whats the mode;student:The mode,5
teacher:Show me your hand signal for mode,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:How many people are in Pablos house,5
teacher:Julian how many people are in Pablos house,5
teacher:Leo how many people are in Yarnells house,5
teacher:And how many people Kate are in Ruths house;student:Three,5

teacher:And Eli how many people are in Garys house;student:Four,5
teacher:Who would like to share what they think is the typical value for a house on Pirate Street,5
teacher:What they think is typical,5
teacher:Claire what do you think,5
teacher:What are your modes,5
teacher:Julian what are you thinking,5
teacher:Where did you get these numbers from,5
teacher:If we do that who could we move first and where could we move them,5
teacher:And Mila how many people are in Brendas house;student:Three,5
teacher:How many twelves do they have;student:I see that well the 7th graders have  and the 8th graders have twelves,5
teacher:What does it only have;student:Because it doesnt have a whole number,5
teacher:And;student:64 74 84,5
teacher:Whats a fraction;student:No,5
teacher:Whats a fraction Andie,5
teacher:That if we have 14 that means one out of how many,5
teacher:Six what;student:Because a hexagon has six faces,5
teacher:Six what,5
teacher:If you fill it up with your blues then you have how many blue pieces covering up the whole;student:If you fill it up like this,5
teacher:What is it 23 of my hexagon,5
teacher:What did you find,5
teacher:Paige found that he had put How many greens did I hear,5
teacher:If the blues are 13 what does the green equal,5
teacher:Remember what my whole is what is my whole,5
teacher:One whole is hexagon so what are my green pieces going to equal,5
teacher:Two blues is equal to 23 what are my greens equal to Natasha,5
teacher:How many triangles can I fit in one whole of my hexagon,5
teacher:How many is one equal to;student:Six,5
teacher:What is the fraction,5
teacher:Noelle can you tell me what one 12 is,5
teacher:Aldo what is a fraction,5
teacher:How do you know,5
teacher:Then on my sixths what is one whole equal to,5
teacher:So whats your drawing,5
teacher:What did I forget,5
teacher:If I have my sixths how many lines did they give us for our sixths,5
teacher:If I have three lines how did you know how many lines you had to put in,5
teacher:How many more lines am I going to need;student:No,5
teacher:Cecilia where would you put our two more lines,5
teacher:What do you mean;student:Yes does the zero and onesixth count,5
teacher:How many lines did they give us for our twelfths,5
teacher:What is my first line SS the way over here,5
teacher:Then what is this one on the far side,5
teacher:How;student:Yes,5
teacher:How Amalia,5
teacher:What now,5
teacher:What happens,5
teacher:What is a fraction,5
teacher:What is that one cSSed;student:One 12 is this one,5
teacher:Its two pieces and how many are we talking about,5
teacher:Out of two how many are we talking about;student:Two,5
teacher:Why else,5
teacher:Whoa what happened,5
teacher:How am I going to do that,5
teacher:Whats my first step when I find a common denominator,5
teacher:Whats my first step,5
teacher:Emilio whats the first multiple of four,5
teacher:The first multiple of four is,5
teacher:First multiple of four is,5
teacher:Then whats the second multiple of four;student:Four,5
teacher:Cory whats the next one;student:Eight,5
teacher:Melanie whats the next one,5
teacher:Six;student:Six,5
teacher:Larry whats the last one,5
teacher:Addison what do you see;student:Yes,5
teacher:Why,5
teacher:Lance what do dogs and cats have four of,5
teacher:Four and what do both dogs and cats have four of;student:Four,5
teacher:What do we know quad means Kareem,5
teacher:What do we know,5
teacher:Out of two pieces how many is one,5
teacher:Ashton what did you find,5
teacher:What does my sixth look like Rebecca,5
teacher:No my whole is the hexagon what is my sixth What shape are those;student:A sixth looks like a whole hexagon,5
teacher:You get way too caught up in the numbers when you guys can show me that you know why 23 and 46 are,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Five what;student:Five,5
teacher:Were going from zero for our sixth what is zero equal to,5
teacher:What do you think Addison,5
teacher:Equals what;student:Three plus two,5
teacher:Five what;student:Five,5
teacher:Aiden what else could,5
teacher:Oh but Im doing three dogs plus two cats so if Im asking how many animals or;student:It could also equal six because times,5
teacher:What if I throw a pencil,5
teacher:What do you mean by that;student:These are the same things,5
teacher:If I said how many animals are up on the board and you saw three dogs and two cats and a pencil how many animals would you say,5
teacher:What am I adding together Ave,5
teacher:Threethirds because thats like saying if I have a pizza thats cut into three pieces and my brother told me that he ate a whole pizza how many pieces did he eat;student:Threethirds,5
teacher:What is my whole going to be for my thirds,5
teacher:Tentenths so what about my thirds,5
teacher:Now heres the crazy question what would the second one be,5
teacher:Whats next,5
teacher:Whats next;student:Three fifths,5
teacher:What is the final on the very end;student:Fourfifths,5
teacher:On your paper ActuSSy before we do that talk with your table group how do you think were going to have to add lines,5
teacher:How many do you think were going to have to add,5
teacher:What do you think of that,5
teacher:How many lines do I want;student:Four more because Ill get to fivetenths are five is half of 10 so you would get half of that you just double,5
teacher:How many spots do I want of tenths,5
teacher:me what your group talked about,5
teacher:How many places are we going to have to add it SS,5
teacher:What is this side going to be,5
teacher:Then what is one going to equal,5
teacher:We have one two three four five how many more are we going to have to add to get to 10,5
teacher:If I just put a line in the middle of each of my fifths Im doubling my fifths and if I have two fifths or two fives how much do I have,5
teacher:One what;student:One,5
teacher:How many,5
teacher:If Im counting by fifths what is this first,5
teacher:If there are four lines what does the number line usuSSy start with,5
teacher:Hey Joe what should I do now,5
teacher:Add them up so 15  25 is 40  15 is;student:You should add them up,5
teacher:This represents what,5
teacher:This 18,5
teacher:When you guys talked with your table groups about what you remember about fractions what are some of the things that you shared,5
teacher:Brennan what you did you share,5
teacher:Amalia what did you and your group talk about,5
teacher:What do you think youre going to start with,5
teacher:Stephen what did you and your table talk about,5
teacher:What do you mean by that,5
teacher:When you say how fractions can be used what do you mean by that;student:How fractions can be used and that the fractions are part of the whole,5
teacher:Raymond what is a number line,5
teacher:What do you notice about your fifths and your tenths,5
teacher:What do you notice,5
teacher:On your fifths how many lines you have,5
teacher:Turn and talk to somebody next to you how many lines are on fingers,5
teacher:How what can be used;student:We talked about how it can be used,5
teacher:Why dont we have to touch that one,5
teacher:Where did you start,5
teacher:SS right what do I want you guys to do,5
teacher:Any more,5
teacher:Terrance what are you missing,5
teacher:Lets count halves together,5
teacher:How about fifths;student:Zero halves one half two halves,5
teacher:Nice can we do tenths;student:05 15 25 35 45 55,5
teacher:The next one says what,5
teacher:Zero onethird twothirds threethirds can you do sixths,5
teacher:How are you going to do sixths,5
teacher:How did you know that it has a zero,5
teacher:If were going by third what is one whole going to be,5
teacher:How are we going to get there,5
teacher:If were looking at our thirds what is this far side going to be,5
teacher:Then if were counting by thirds what is our one whole going to be,5
teacher:What is our one whole for our fifths,5
teacher:Fivefifths what is our one whole for our tenths;student:Fivefifths,5
teacher:How much do we know that tentenths is equal to;student:One,5
teacher:How much do we know that fivefifths is equal to,5
teacher:Who else found one;student:Threefifths equals to sixtenths,5
teacher:that on your paper Cecilia what do you find is equal to threefifths,5
teacher:Shane what does SS these equals,5
teacher:Shane how do you know that;student:Two tenths,5
teacher:Theyre right on top of each other so one fifth is equal to what;student:Theyre on top of each other,5
teacher:SS right Camilla whats one pair that you found,5
teacher:Does anyone want to explain how these twofifths equals fourtenths,5
teacher:How;student:Yes,5
teacher:Do you think theyre going to equal each other yes or no,5
teacher:Where am I going to glue my tenths;student:No,5
teacher:Let us look at this which one is my fifths my green or my purple;student:Its two fives,5
teacher:How did I get three,5
teacher:I have two fifths and how many fourths does it equal,5
teacher:I am sorry tenths;student:Four,5
teacher:Did anybody else find another pair,5
teacher:Try and talk to somebody next to you show them another pair you found,5
teacher:Cecilia whats another one that you found,5
teacher:another one that they found,5
teacher:How many fifths am I talking about right now,5
teacher:Im just going to keep how many pieces I ate and then over here Im going to show that is out of how many,5
teacher:Which is;student:If add 10 divided by the denominator,5
teacher:What did I do to this four to turn it into a 12;student:Teach us again,5
teacher:Axton can help me know how youre doing this,5
teacher:How did you know where to put that three,5
teacher:If this is 110 and its 0 and 110 then 310 is going to look pretty similar because the three is in the,5
teacher:Zachary read this fraction for me,5
teacher:Read it,5
teacher:Apollo read it for me,5
teacher:Apollo where am I going to put my two;student:2100,5
teacher:You said put the zero in what place value;student:Youre going to put your two on the back and then you add the zero first and then point zero then two,5
teacher:9100 so where am I going to put that nine,5
teacher:Jane read this fraction for me,5
teacher:9100 so Jane where is my nine going to go;student:9100,5
teacher:In what place value,5
teacher:Read it to me one more time,5
teacher:So which place value is it going to go in tenths or hundredths;student:9100,5
teacher:Hundredths yes so my nine goes here and then Jane what else goes in my blank;student:Hundredths,5
teacher:Who can walk me through how to figure out this one,5
teacher:What am I missing,5
teacher:What about this one,5
teacher:Anderson what is that fraction,5
teacher:Then what,5
teacher:Ivanaone thing;student:We add all of the answers together,5
teacher:All right Wayne next step,5
teacher:To make sure theres one every,5
teacher:Who can read this big old answer for me;student:42 is 6 and then 10 is 1,5
teacher:Read this long number for us;student:Oh my God,5
teacher:Harriette give this number a shot,5
teacher:All right Wade give it another try,5
teacher:What is that comma saying,5
teacher:Jane what is this number,5
teacher:1000 so whats the commas name,5
teacher:Thousands okay so if its 169;student:Thousands,5
teacher:How many problems will you see on the board,5
teacher:How many are you going to answer,5
teacher:Who can give me this fraction,5
teacher:So if I say 110 where am I going put my one;student:Yes,5
teacher:Winston what did you say,5
teacher:A period but in math it is a,5
teacher:Dakota what is this fraction;student:80100,5
teacher:How many pieces were in these two pieces,5
teacher:Can you guys tell me that,5
teacher:Dana how many pieces were in these two pizzas,5
teacher:How do I know how many pieces are in this pizza;student:No,5
teacher:Ivana how do I know that there are four pieces in these two pizzas;student:I dont know,5
teacher:Wow okay so this whole pizza was four pieces and this whole pizza was another four pieces because one is equal to what fraction in this case;student:Yes,5
teacher:This whole pizza what fraction of the pizza that I eat Harriette,5
teacher:One whole or Ernie;student:One whole,5
teacher:44 because out of four pieces I ate how many Darby;student:44,5
teacher:What about this one,5
teacher:How much of this pizza did I eat,5
teacher:44 what about this one;student:44,5
teacher:Dana help me out one of these pieces how much am I eating,5
teacher:All right what about this one if I ate both of those,5
teacher:What about this one;student:24,5
teacher:How much of this one,5
teacher:One two and then how much of a fourth,5
teacher:Ivana how many whole pizzas did I eat,5
teacher:If I come in and I say Oh my gosh it hurts so bad how much pizza did I eat Dakota,5
teacher:Dana read me this fraction;student:80100,5
teacher:If I wanted to read this like 80100 where would my eight go;student:No,5
teacher:What place value would it be in,5
teacher:He said lets put the eight in the 10th place and then Winston what am I going to put in the hundredths,5
teacher:The one where in the one;student:The one,5
teacher:Okay so lets read this,5
teacher:0 and 80 what;student:080,5
teacher:Where did you get those numbers 3x3;student:Because if we combine threes three times three six nine,5
teacher:Dakota read it for me;student:Hundredths,5
teacher:Zachary read it for me;student:0 and 80100,5
teacher:How would you show 2 14 as a picture and what could be an equivalent fraction for 2 14,5
teacher:How would I show 24,5
teacher:How would I show two wholes,5
teacher:Okay if I say that last night I ate 2 14 of pizza how many do you think I ate;student:Yes,5
teacher:I ate two whole pizzas and then how much of a third one;student:Two,5
teacher:Oh my gosh how much pizza did I eat,5
teacher:Jane read it for me,5
teacher:Yes what does that look like;student:The ear,5
teacher:Harriette tell me the next step,5
teacher:Who could tell me the next step,5
teacher:If a fraction is a piece of a whole who knows what decomposing means,5
teacher:Where have you heard that word before,5
teacher:Tell somebody next to you where you have heard that word before,5
teacher:Where have you heard decomposing before,5
teacher:Finley where have you heard decomposing before,5
teacher:Frankie where have you heard decomposing before,5
teacher:Carter where have you heard that break apart decomposing before,5
teacher:What connection are you making,5
teacher:Have you guys ever heard of In science we have consumers and producers does anyone know the third one,5
teacher:How would you create an equation to show me how many fourths you have,5
teacher:Okay so what would your equation  show how we got 34,5
teacher:If you take one out how many is this,5
teacher:How would you make that into an equation,5
teacher:What is an equation;student:Yes,5
teacher:What is an equation Brody,5
teacher:Lucille what is a fraction,5
teacher:Someone raise their hand what is a fraction,5
teacher:What is a fraction;student:Yes,5
teacher:What would that equivalent fraction be to 35 6 over what;student:It took us two times to do it so were going to do 32 and 326,5
teacher:How do I turn four into 12,5
teacher:By what;student:Multiply,5
teacher:How many times did we count by four to get to 12,5
teacher:How did we turn four into 12 Karina,5
teacher:Whatever I do to the bottom,5
teacher:13 is;student:I do to the top,5
teacher:Which ones bigger;student:Yes,5
teacher:Does an equation have to have all of these things,5
teacher:Lance what did you do next,5
teacher:If this is a giant candybar if this is a candybar and this is a candybar which one do you want,5
teacher:Which one is going to give you more,5
teacher:How can we do 35 and 710 using some numbers,5
teacher:Can we change one of our denominators,5
teacher:Someone else other than me walk me through how you do this,5
teacher:Can you explain while you do this what youre doing;student:Yes,5
teacher:Lance explain to us what youre doing,5
teacher:Lois whatre you finding;student:I need to,5
teacher:What did I do to this four to turn it into 12,5
teacher:Okay so when I asked you to create an equation to show how you made 34 what did you guys talk about;student:Yes,5
teacher:What could it look like,5
teacher:If we just made an equation to make 34 with our yellows how can we create an equation to show how we made 45,5
teacher:No but if I wanted to come up with an equation to put 45 together how do you make it;student:No,5
teacher:If you had to explain it to a kindergartener how would you make 45,5
teacher:Whats another way,5
teacher:Equals what;student:15 15 15 15,5
teacher:How much is this now,5
teacher:Then one more would be,5
teacher:Is there another equation we can do to find 45,5
teacher:Mabel whats one,5
teacher:Okay how did you Can you show us 25  25,5
teacher:Is there another equation we could do to find 45,5
teacher:Kerry what is it,5
teacher:Kerry can you hold up the pieces and show us how 35  15 would make 45;student:35  15,5
teacher:Thats,5
teacher:Eventually we might be asked what is 15  14,5
teacher:Jude if I was going to have an equation to show what you did what could it be,5
teacher:How many pieces did you put on to your whole;student:A whole because if This ones missing one piece because its 45,5
teacher:55 is the same thing as saying what,5
teacher:Okay 55 equal what;student:55,5
teacher:How do I know;student:Yes,5
teacher:Honour how do I know that this is 44,5
teacher:Because theres four pieces and how many do I have out of all my four pieces;student:Because theyre four pieces,5
teacher:If you had these pieces out in front of you and Im taking 44 and Im taking away 14 how much is 14 of my picture,5
teacher:Arveny how many would I take out if Im just going to take our 14,5
teacher:How many do I have left now,5
teacher:All right heres the challenge talk with your table groups come up with a different equation for this 34,5
teacher:What does your equation look like,5
teacher:How can I show 34 in an equation,5
teacher:Honour how many do I have in all,5
teacher:Did anyone come up with another equation to show 34,5
teacher:What did you come up with,5
teacher:What do you mean by that;student:Because it will be a different fraction,5
teacher:Angel can you share what we talked about,5
teacher:What are they at the end;student:No,5
teacher:Jude how did you make 45,5
teacher:Mabel what did you guys come up with,5
teacher:Yes what do you know;student:I know something,5
teacher:This says look at the sixthgrade data table what do you think is the typical number of movies watched by a 6th grader,5
teacher:If something happens the most what do we say,5
teacher:Can someone explain that for us;student:Steeper,5
teacher:If Phillip goes one meter per second how long will it take him to do this 100meter race,5
teacher:What if he goes three meters per second;student:Yes,5
teacher:Five meters per second how long will it take,5
teacher:Couple important things whats the number of dollars per kilometer that sponsor B pledges,5
teacher:The starred one here it says what does the point where the line crosses the yaxis mean,5
teacher:Which of these points shows hats being worth 5,5
teacher:How much money is in the account,5
teacher:what else do we know about this task;student:Its a crisis what happened,5

teacher:Then 16 whats that going to become,5
teacher:What should I do next Olivia,5
teacher:Whats 2 912 going to become,5
teacher:Lets talk about a strategy and actually if you could look at number two first can somebody help me out with these numbers that should go in here;student:The total hours worked it wasnt that hard it was just,5
teacher:What should I do next Emmett,5
teacher:How am I going to do that,5
teacher:Now were going to do 33 divided by 2 which I can also write as 332 which is equal to Yes Claire,5

teacher:So X goes up by two here Y goes what,5
teacher:48 and,5
teacher:For this one whats the mean,5
teacher:Whats in between two and two;student:Yes,5
teacher:If you do this it should work out perfectly evenly and whats the mean,5
teacher:What was the mode for Bens times,5
teacher:Mode;student:Oh its the mode,5
teacher:Where is the mean line at,5
teacher:What do we need to do first,5
teacher:This ones really interesting to me because we talked about range whats the range for Bens,5
teacher:What was it Margie;student:Oh ah ooh,5
teacher:What was the range for Bobs,5
teacher:Whats the range for Seths,5
teacher:What does that mean in this problem if you have a small range,5
teacher:Sean what does that mean,5
teacher:Whats the median of this list,5
teacher:How can we find that,5
teacher:Median how can we find median,5
teacher:Right now you can mark it on your paper but whats the middle of this list up here,5
teacher:Whats the next one,5
teacher:Now what do you think,5
teacher:Whats the range for Bob,5
teacher:For this one,5
teacher:All right lets see what 12 times 16 is,5
teacher:What is Bens shortest time,5
teacher:How many ones are there,5
teacher:How many twos are there,5

teacher:Evan do you have an option for the smallest,5
teacher:What numbers did you put in;student:7,5
teacher:If X equals 2 whats the opposite of X,5
teacher:If X equals 2 whats the opposite of X;student:2,5
teacher:What did you divide at the end Regina for D;student:Then I got 21429 for a number,5
teacher:Regina what did you divide by the end,5
teacher:So for D and E anybody realized why these are tricky more tricky than the other ones,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Wait how did you get that;student:What would happen if you have an answer that is 5XX,5
teacher:Whats an example of one of the highest numbers for X,5
teacher:Negative what,5
teacher:Anybody have something that they think is the largest,5
teacher:what do you think,5
teacher:Vera what do you think,5
teacher:Lets see if we solve this what do we get,5
teacher:This for largest or smallest;student:I did,5
teacher:What should my first step be here,5
teacher:Then what,5
teacher:Okay and x equals;student:Divide by three,5
teacher:I want you and your team to try to figure out how can you make some of these parts,5
teacher:How can you make a part thats a square with those two points as vertices,5
teacher:What does vertices mean again,5
teacher:you find three rectangles,5
teacher:What does 38 start with,5
teacher:Whats the benchmark,5
teacher:Whats half of eight,5

teacher:How can I figure out how far up I need to go between these,5
teacher:If x is three 3  4 and this side is,5
teacher:You all had some really good conversations in the groups about how to go from one place to the other especially about Part C Were going to focus on part C Actually lets go through well just quickly share out A and B and then well talk about Part C Who can help us out with A1 which I believe is  which one is A1,5
teacher:The second one is the animal shelter Sterling,5
teacher:6 2 because you go down and the stadium;student:6 2,5

teacher:What if we work backwards all the way to 0;student:Yes,5
teacher:Melvin youve got an equation for us,5
teacher:Melvin can you tell us that equation one more time,5
teacher:The Yintercept is  and the slope,5
teacher:Other way slope with the X Y;student:Y 1  2X,5
teacher:what did you say Paisley,5
teacher:Oh what is it;student:I said 1  2X,5
teacher:First of all is this increasing or decreasing,5
teacher:Whats the run,5
teacher:3 and what is the rise;student:3,5
teacher:What is the Y value for this,5
teacher:Then what about this one,5
teacher:Down 6 so thats the same ratios here and then last one;student:Then down 6,5
teacher:Plus what;student:2,5
teacher:What are we going down by here,5
teacher:What are we going up by here,5
teacher:3and y goes up by;student:3,5
teacher:9 is that the same ratio;student:9,5
teacher:Okay and then X goes up by;student:Yes,5
teacher:1 and;student:1,5
teacher:Okay what do you think that the Y value is for 2;student:Yes,5
teacher:5 so right in between these;student:5,5
teacher:What do you think the Y value is for 4,5
teacher:What do I need to add every time if Im going backwards;student:Yes,5
teacher:Notice how this connects to the slope from 2 to 5 what is it plus what,5
teacher:8 to 11;student:3,5
teacher:11 to 14;student:3,5
teacher:Whos got an equation for this one,5
teacher:Ty what do you think,5
teacher:How did you write it differently;student:I wrote it differently,5
teacher:What are we going up by here,5
teacher:What are we going down by here,5
teacher:3 what about from 5 to 8;student:3,5
teacher:2 and up by;student:2,5
teacher:Okay Miles you have an equation for us;student:Yes,5
teacher:Whats the biggest X value out of those two points,5
teacher:First how do we even get an answer;student:For the equation,5
teacher:How did you figure that out;student:In these bags are four coins,5
teacher:How many sections of that did we have to start,5

teacher:Archer whats your equation,5
teacher:Whos got an equation for this strategy,5
teacher:Oliver what do you think,5
teacher:What is my number,5
teacher:Yes if were going backwards how do we do this in the word part;student:Wait are we asking how to do this,5
teacher:Then you might notice now theres one pouch and its equal to;student:I went up from three,5
teacher:9  9 is,5
teacher:Whos got an equation before I show you the other way,5
teacher:Ariella whats an equation for this,5
teacher:Can anybody think of one that uses parenthesis for both sides,5
teacher:Ariella what do you think,5
teacher:How many coins did we have left over,5

teacher:Is our answer 5 14 or is it 5 12,5
teacher:Crew what do you think,5
teacher:Rylan what do you know about yurts,5
teacher:We learned in the previous problem that 40 yurts can accommodate 240 people but lets say that I want to scale this down and I have another problem that says how many people can 8 yurts accommodate,5
teacher:Does somebody have a good strategy that they use to divide 240 mentally without writing it down,5
teacher:How would you do that mentally,5
teacher:can you tell us how you might do that mentally,5
teacher:What would your final answer be;student:Then 40 divided by 5 is 8,5
teacher:If he knew that there were 240 people and 40 yurts so Michael it sounds like the first thing you did was divide by 10 or did you divide by 2 first,5
teacher:This answers your question would be like how do we know what to get to,5
teacher:What do you think this ones going to be,5
teacher:If I take away 1 yurt how many people do I need to subtract,5
teacher:What now,5
teacher:For your warmup today you might have the question what is the unit rate,5
teacher:Let me see  what are the two things were comparing,5
teacher:If we look here what are the two objects or the two words were comparing;student:8 and 24,5
teacher:Does somebody have another common factor we could do,5
teacher:Lila what did we compare,5
teacher:Cole what are you thinking,5
teacher:David what did we compare,5

teacher:Not its not four times two its four times four;student:Eight,5
teacher:All right Blake what am I going to do next,5
teacher:What do you see;student:Yes,5
teacher:Whats three times six,5
teacher:Now all we have left is addition and subtraction Isaac what should I do first,5
teacher:Miah what should I do next,5
teacher:Which is;student:Now you do 28 minus 16,5
teacher:8  1 whats my final answer,5
teacher:What is 12 plus one,5
teacher:Tell them one thing you learned about exponents today,5
teacher:What do you think this is a signal for,5
teacher:Youre ready for what;student:Youre ready,5
teacher:Brandon my question says find the GCF for 21 and 15,5
teacher:We did Quiz Quiz what are we going to do now,5
teacher:What should you remember as youre playing this game today,5
teacher:What did we look at yesterday when we were comparing ratios,5
teacher:Alicia what would it be,5
teacher:Were training the dog looks like a hera to me what you guys think,5
teacher:Is 16 the treats or the tricks,5
teacher:Im going to start by what does your first step say,5
teacher:The next ratio table says how many yurts will they need,5
teacher:Who has an idea for what I could do first to get to 130;student:130,5
teacher:What is your proposal Eric,5

teacher:How do we know that we need to get this up to 172,5
teacher:We need to get our total number of students up to what number Crew,5
teacher:We ended by talking about,5
teacher:All right David what do you propose for,5
teacher:Good tell me how you did that;student:I say Holly gets for every one trick she gets four treats,5
teacher:Per trick who is getting more treats,5
teacher:Jonah who is getting more treats,5
teacher:Well how do you know;student:The rabbit,5
teacher:What could something be that is inbetween,5
teacher:Tell me what youre thinking so far,5
teacher:Whats four to the second;student:Yes,5
teacher:What are you thinking so far;student:I think there may be,5
teacher:What do you mean four to four actually;student:Thought it could be like a four to four,5
teacher:What can we do so that maybe our hamster could get a whole number of treats,5
teacher:Do you know Damien,5
teacher:Yes to what;student:I dont know the actual number but I think that we could change the number of tricks that they do,5
teacher:If we scale this up to three what happens,5
teacher:You could also Is there something else that you could do,5
teacher:That would be two treats two tricks and how many treats,5
teacher:Thats what youre asking instead of this thing like this one into decimal but what would the Hamster be;student:You could  decimals,5
teacher:What are our exponents,5
teacher:Where;student:Yes,5
teacher:Its also on the board over there if you ever want to Do we have any grouping symbols,5
teacher:What would that tell you to do,5
teacher:What would 3 to the 4th tell you to do,5
teacher:Turn to your 2 by 2 partner and tell your 2 by 2 partner what it tells you to do,5
teacher:Okay what does 3 to the 4th tell you to do Nick,5

teacher:What is 6  2,5
teacher:Which is what;student:It would be 10  8,5
teacher:For number four Elise what should I do first,5
teacher:Yes which is what;student:You should do the multiplying 5 x 2,5
teacher:Alan what do I do next,5
teacher:Divide what;student:Next what you should do is divide,5
teacher:What do I do next Chloe,5
teacher:What should we do first,5
teacher:Thank you very much what do we do next Bryce;student:Then it can be like,5
teacher:Reuben whats my final answer,5
teacher:What should I do first Maggie,5
teacher:Whats 2 x 2 guys,5
teacher:Now I would tell Nate just to be very careful that you know that you do addition and subtraction from left to right and multiplication and division from left to right as well,5
teacher:Whats 3  8,5
teacher:What are we going to do next,5
teacher:What mistake did Cat make,5
teacher:What mistake did Cat make,5
teacher:We realized Chloe what was this right here,5

teacher:Whats eight divided by two;student:Six,5
teacher:What are they;student:Yes,5
teacher:Whats six divided by two,5
teacher:Okay and four divided by two;student:Three,5
teacher:Then we could take 2x24 or 3x16 to get what,5
teacher:Greatest common factor over here you could say what would that be,5
teacher:What should I do first,5
teacher:Whats 12 divided by 2,5
teacher:how are we going to go up a little bit more,5
teacher:Andrew what do we need to do make sure that we have enough bars for everybody,5
teacher:Wyatt what are you thinking,5
teacher:Which one;student:Because its a little bit bigger,5
teacher:Number two says which benchmark is 58100 closest to,5
teacher:Explain how you made your decision,5
teacher:This person said 58100 is closest to 12 because 58100 rounds to 16100 or 610 and 610 is,5
teacher:Which one of these fractions you think 58100 is closest to;student:I understand it,5
teacher:What could your question be do you think,5
teacher:Whats a question that you think someone could ask if theyre not sure how to solve this problem,5
teacher:Jason whats the question you might ask if you needed help starting with number two;student:I think I know,5
teacher:Whats 58 cents close to,5

teacher:What might you say to them,5
teacher:Ashley what would you say to somebody who put the dot on one,5
teacher:What is 12 how many 18 would that be;student:Yes,5
teacher:Who has a strategy that we could use to determine how much money was raised,5
teacher:Who has a strategy,5
teacher:Michael what do you think,5
teacher:How would you find how much 110 is;student:We can write it up as amount and use the fraction from there,5
teacher:Max what do you think,5
teacher:Can you think of a way that you can be more precise,5
teacher:Anthony what are you thinking,5
teacher:Quinn do you know,5
teacher:Can I show you guys one strategy;student:Oh yes I have that,5
teacher:What d you find,5
teacher:For a total of how many,5
teacher:How can we figure out how much 14 of 300 is,5
teacher:How can we figure that out,5
teacher:What are you thinking Zach,5
teacher:How is that going to help you find how much 14 is,5
teacher:Yes do you know what 300 divided by 4 is;student:You could divide the 14 by 300 or you could divide 300 by 4,5
teacher:Okay what do you find Carter,5
teacher:I guess you could say how many do they each drink,5
teacher:Parker what are you thinking,5
teacher:What do you think Chris,5
teacher:What do you think it is,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Crew what is the common denominator between five and three,5

teacher:What do you think Quinn,5
teacher:What do you think Adam,5
teacher:I rounded up okay I took away how much too much,5
teacher:I have seven and 1524s plus 1624s which is what,5
teacher:Its 13 minus 5  because you took away  whats the difference between eight and 15,5
teacher:Do you recognize that from somewhere Gabrielle;student:I recognize it,5
teacher:Meaning like if you have a remainder what does that actually mean,5
teacher:The biggest mistake that kids make when theyre subtracting fractions,5
teacher:Do you guys know what the biggest mistake that weve done,5
teacher:Sorry I wrote that down Whats six divided by three,5
teacher:How did you get eight and 96 to nine and 12,5
teacher:Ill start with a common factor for 9 and 12 is,5
teacher:What do we multiply 9 by to get to 36,5
teacher:5 times 4 is,5
teacher:What do we multiply 12 by to get to 36,5
teacher:Whats seven times three crew,5
teacher:How can I write 4136 as a mixed number,5
teacher:How can I write 4136 as a mixed number,5
teacher:No what are you thinking;student:No,5
teacher:Brianna what are you thinking,5
teacher:What do you have for your whole number,5
teacher:What do you have your whole number,5
teacher:Whats three plus five,5
teacher:Then 96 can you please write 96 as a mixed number,5
teacher:What do you have for the first,5
teacher:What do you have for number one,5
teacher:Nine and;student:Nine and 16,5
teacher:Whats the common multiple between 9 and 6,5
teacher:It means what,5
teacher:What do you guys think for this one;student:I did eight,5
teacher:Now your last question asked you about how many cans of orange juice did they drink,5
teacher:Whats it going to be if I divide 100 by 10 what will be at,5
teacher:What do I need to do,5
teacher:Love it and what do I need to do to the top;student:Multiply by two,5
teacher:What would I get;student:Multiply by two,5
teacher:James solve that problem please,5
teacher:What do you think these people are doing;student:I got six,5
teacher:Your goal today is how can we use ratio tables to find unit rates,5
teacher:Amber why do you enjoy Costco;student:I have no idea,5
teacher:Why  Tell me more about this cost thing;student:Thats from TV remotes all the way up to I dont know,5
teacher:Tell me more about this cost thing;student:They always have deals,5
teacher:What does that mean;student:Its like theres,5
teacher:Tell us your love of Costco,5
teacher:Well do some lemons here so if I were to tell you that 5 lemons cost 125 and I want to know the unit price what am I asking for when I say what is the unit price for the lemons;student:That reminds me of,5
teacher:If I were to say what is the unit price,5
teacher:What question am I asking,5
teacher:Help me get to 10 please Drew;student:We have a pacer test,5
teacher:To get what;student:Multiply by two on the top,5
teacher:If I multiply by two on the bottom what do I need to do,5
teacher:What do I need to do to get to 20;student:Yes,5
teacher:Can I ask you to be a little bit more precise with your definition,5
teacher:When you said it cant get to 100 what were you referring to,5
teacher:What did we call that number in the bottom,5
teacher:If we know that 110 of 50 is 5 and 10 is equal to 110 what is 10 of 50,5
teacher:Here what strategy could I use,5
teacher:Lucas if I divide both of my values both my number and my percent by 10 what am I going to get,5
teacher:What is 10 of 80,5
teacher:What is my unit price for lemons,5
teacher:Who feels like they could tackle this whole problem,5
teacher:What are you thinking Andrew,5
teacher:Jackson what are you thinking;student:Can you call on someone else because  It makes sense in my head the way I did it,5
teacher:What can I do to get it down to 10 Cooper,5
teacher:Yes what are you thinking,5
teacher:What do you think Wyatt,5
teacher:What would it be;student:Because if you divide by 10 the bottom the denominator will be 10 then you would get your new number on the numerator,5
teacher:What are you thinking,5
teacher:How am I going to start by setting up my ratio table,5
teacher:What do you think Mr Wills class might be,5
teacher:Partner A I would like you to tell Partner B what you think the unit price is,5
teacher:Tell us how you got that;student:25 cents,5
teacher:Mason whats another strategy,5
teacher:Who has another different strategy,5
teacher:You have another one Luke,5
teacher:what are you thinking,5
teacher:Anthony what are you thinking,5
teacher:How do you know if thats correct;student:I agree,5
teacher:With a raised hand can someone share a statement that they wrote for 3B,5
teacher:Emily what did you write,5
teacher:Anna do want to share yours,5
teacher:Do you want to show yours Halina,5
teacher:If this is Mr Lees class and we know that thats 10 Im going to move it over here,5
teacher:How many pieces do you have here,5
teacher:Of the total cans of juice how much of it is orange juice,5
teacher:Number 42 says in which class would you say orange juice was the most popular,5
teacher:Luke what you think,5
teacher:Who has another strategy for how we could get 72,5
teacher:Amy what are you thinking,5
teacher:How can we get to 72 if we know 110 is 12,5
teacher:Then how could we get to 72,5
teacher:How did you know four lemons were a 1;student:I knew that four lemons are a 1 so if you add one more thats 20 and thats,5
teacher:What is the unit price for 1 orange,5
teacher:Who would like to share their strategy;student:How do you do,5
teacher:Who would like to share their strategy,5
teacher:Did you just guess and check for 75 cents or did you do something else;student:I think they are 75 cents because 75 plus 75 is 150 and then when you multiply it by 2 you get 300 then add it again,5
teacher:How do you know that all of those values are correct;student:I do agree with all the values,5
teacher:How do you know that 64 is 810;student:I know that 64 is 810 of 80,5
teacher:Andrew what would be the cost of one lemon,5
teacher:How did you find 110,5
teacher:Which one do you agree with;student:I agree with them,5
teacher:How did you get that one;student:I agree with the 72,5
teacher:Right here how did you know that this one was 12;student:I kept adding 12,5
teacher:Because theres 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 how did you know that 110 would be 12,5
teacher:How do we know that would be 12,5
teacher:Emily what do you know,5
teacher:What do you think;student:Thats how I got that,5
teacher:For every 110 on the fraction bar how much money has been raised,5
teacher:What do you notice about how I answered 34 by 14,5
teacher:What do we do now,5
teacher:What is our numerator and what is our denominator,5
teacher:What symbols do we use when we compare fractions,5
teacher:What do we use Harley,5
teacher:Were saying which one would get the bigger slice,5
teacher:Which ones bigger,5
teacher:Do we have anything in common when we look at these two fractions;student:Its ones,5
teacher:Judith what do they have in common,5
teacher:They both have a one where;student:They both have a one,5
teacher:If they both have a one for the numerator how many pieces are we getting,5
teacher:The number of pieces doesnt change but the size of our piece change so 13 or 17,5
teacher:We cut that piece into more pieces for our slices actually got,5
teacher:Whats similar in these two fractions,5
teacher:What do I have thats the same,5
teacher:The denominator is the same so what does that tell me about my pieces;student:The dominator is the same number,5
teacher:The size of my pieces Im changing whats different,5
teacher:How many pieces Im getting so in that first fraction 25 how many pieces do I get;student:Which pieces youre getting,5
teacher:All right so yesterday who can remind me about what happened yesterday,5
teacher:In 55 how many pieces do I get,5
teacher:You have your fraction circles and you have the rule I gave you whatever we will do to the bottom,5
teacher:James what one fraction you wrote thats equivalent,5
teacher:What could I do to the number one to turn it into a two;student:Add one,5
teacher:We can add one what else could we do;student:You could just add one,5
teacher:What do you see;student:Yes,5
teacher:Looking at what I did what do you see,5
teacher:Lets see if were going from one third to what was that other one,5
teacher:How can I turn a number one into a number four,5
teacher:One times four what can I do the bottom to get 12,5
teacher:What can I multiply one by to get five,5
teacher:I should see more hands what can I multiply one by to get five Austin;student:By five,5
teacher:Times five what can I multiply two by to get 10;student:Times five,5
teacher:Lets say I want to find fractions equivalent to one half and I want it to have a denominator of 20 what would my numerator be,5
teacher:Let me first ask myself a question what am I doing to two to get 20,5
teacher:But I get to eat how many,5
teacher:What could it be Willow;student:Yes,5
teacher:That one works as long as my numerator is what,5
teacher:Whats the fraction you wrote Austin,5
teacher:25 is greater or 55 is greater,5
teacher:55 so how would we read this number seven;student:55,5
teacher:How would we read Xavier,5
teacher:How many pieces do I get here,5
teacher:How many pieces do I get here;student:Five,5
teacher:Where do I get more pieces,5
teacher:So what could I do;student:No,5
teacher:What would you change about it;student:Yes,5
teacher:To a what,5
teacher:Multiplying by three so if I want to make a nine 33 is going to give me nine whatever I do to the bottom;student:Multiply by three,5
teacher:Whats 13;student:I do to the top,5
teacher:Now were comparing 39 and 49 which ones bigger;student:Three,5
teacher:Renata which ones bigger,5
teacher:How did I go from one to four,5
teacher:Whatever I do to the top,5
teacher:34 is;student:I do to the bottom,5
teacher:Let me ask you is 49 bigger than 412,5
teacher:How do you know;student:Yes,5
teacher:Which ones bigger,5
teacher:Five because 1x5 is;student:Five,5
teacher:We ask again whats my new numerator;student:Five,5
teacher:Whats my new numerator;student:I do to the top,5
teacher:25 is;student:25 is greater than,5
teacher:Yes if we started over here what would it say;student:Yes,5
teacher:Do we have a common denominator;student:No,5
teacher:How are we going to do this,5
teacher:What strategies did we talk about yesterday,5
teacher:Yes so in that faction over there the pieces are pretty small but Im getting 10 over how can I be sure;student:The bigger the denominator the smaller the piece,5
teacher:Give me more,5
teacher:What can I do to one to get two,5
teacher:What do I want to make,5
teacher:What do we want to change,5
teacher:What do we want to make in common,5
teacher:What do you want to try,5
teacher:Were going to change the denominator and we want to have a denominator of,5
teacher:I want to make my denominator what,5
teacher:If Im starting with five what do I have to do to five to get 25,5
teacher:Whatever I do to the bottom;student:By five,5
teacher:Which one should I be multiplying to is it that first one or the second one,5
teacher:What can I do to the number three to turn it into six,5
teacher:What can I do to this three to turn it into a six;student:Yes,5
teacher:Nine slices three people how many pieces,5

teacher:How many slices do we need to eat in order to eat half of that pizza,5
teacher:What do you think;student:Yes,5
teacher:How many did I eat,5
teacher:Three out of;student:Three,5
teacher:Three how many did we eat;student:Three,5
teacher:How many slices are in this pizza;student:Because you ate two out of three slices,5

teacher:Six is equal to;student:Six,5
teacher:One if I put them together what do I have;student:One,5
teacher:This is the same as two out of two which equals,5
teacher:If we eat the whole pizza how many slices did we eat,5
teacher:If we eat the whole pizza how many slices did we eat;student:Two,5
teacher:Let me ask you again this pizza right here if we eat the whole thing how many slices did we eat;student:The whole thing,5
teacher:How many pieces is that cut into,5
teacher:Three so whats my denominator going to be;student:Three,5
teacher:What would my numerator be for each of those pieces,5
teacher:Two out of two which equals;student:Four,5
teacher:I want you to talk with your table and see if you guys can work through this what order would you put these,5
teacher:What other fraction circles do you think we could find in a clipaway,5
teacher:How many slices of that dark blue pizza would make an equivalent to one half,5

teacher:Four out of;student:Four,5
teacher:How many slices are in a purple,5
teacher:How many slices do we need to make a fraction equivalent to one third,5
teacher:Luke what do you think,5
teacher:Alright how many pieces in the dark blue,5
teacher:How many pieces Andrew,5
teacher:Now looking for connections just like we had connections between our one half equivalent fractions what do we have going on here;student:Yes,5
teacher:If I were to divide six by three if I have two three four five six if I have six and Im going to divide it into three pieces how many in each one,5
teacher:What is 12 divided by three give me,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:What if the pizza comes and its in 12 slices Piper,5
teacher:If I have nine slices Ezra keeps going back to this nine if I have nine slices in my pizza how many pieces will each person get;student:Nine is the closest to ten that really confuses me,5
teacher:What is this fraction;student:Yes,5
teacher:How many of these green pieces do we need to combine to make one third,5

teacher:What if there were 100 pieces and our pizza,5
teacher:Whats the whole,5
teacher:fractions in,5
teacher:PH whats our smallest fraction,5
teacher:I just made my pieces;student:No,5
teacher:Which reminds me the bigger the denominator;student:Smaller,5
teacher:Who has another the equivalent fraction,5

teacher:4 x 4 is;student:I do to the top,5
teacher:Give me an equivalent fraction for 13,5
teacher:What if I multiply my numerator and my denominator by 26,5
teacher:1 x 2 gives me,5
teacher:Whats another one,5
teacher:What do we multiply by;student:Another one that I have is 128 at the top and 384,5
teacher:Kai do you have another one,5
teacher:1 x 2 is 2 and 4 x 2 is;student:Because whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom,5
teacher:EH what do you think;student:Even if I was Im trying to figure out what the higher number is,5
teacher:Youre multiplying the numerator 1 x 2;student:To get the numerator,5
teacher:Help us make an equivalent fraction for 14,5
teacher:What am I talking about;student:Yes,5
teacher:Whats a fraction,5
teacher:Martine whats a fraction,5
teacher:Ali whats a fraction;student:I forgot,5
teacher:Whats this fancy name for the top part of our fraction,5
teacher:The bottom part,5
teacher:What does a numerator tell you,5
teacher:What is our denominator,5
teacher:Okay if this is my pizza and that is what I eat what will my fraction be,5
teacher:Kyle what is my fraction going to be,5
teacher:What does it mean if its equivalent,5
teacher:Sonia what does it mean,5
teacher:If we take our fraction 14 and I say give me a fraction thats equivalent to 14 can you come up with one,5
teacher:Whatever you do to the top,5
teacher:Somebody walk me through it;student:You do to the bottom,5
teacher:What do we do;student:Yes,5
teacher:What did you multiply by,5
teacher:Whats another one,5
teacher:What do we multiply by;student:515,5
teacher:what do you think,5
teacher:The second time I go how many do I get,5
teacher:Renata tell me your answer and walk me through it,5
teacher:Your thinking is correct I want to take a step back how did we get to this part;student:My answer is one whole and 16 equals It went over number six and you got one whole and then there was no  for this one so its 16,5
teacher:When we added these two what did we get,5
teacher:What do we have here whats this called 76;student:No,5
teacher:Judith do you want to walk me through it,5
teacher:She added her numerators one plus five is,5
teacher:I go to the counter how much fabric do I need to ask for,5
teacher:What are we going to do,5
teacher:Whats different about this problem and the problems that we were just working on,5
teacher:How would you add this,5
teacher:How do you tackle this,5
teacher:How many whole yards do I already have,5
teacher:Look at this if I were to just add these wholes what do I get,5
teacher:Israel whatd you do,5
teacher:Howd you figure out;student:Yes,5
teacher:What fraction of the pizza did I eat,5
teacher:Just the second time what did I grab the second time,5
teacher:What else;student:By five,5
teacher:Jeremy what are we going to do;student:Got it,5
teacher:Kai what are we going to do,5
teacher:Because whatever you do to the bottom;student:Then putting the 4 x 1 which he got four because,5
teacher:Miss Calice because shes so amazing said Whatever you do at the bottom,5
teacher:Now we have 1 x 4 is,5
teacher:5 x 5 is,5
teacher:Do you see what were doing,5
teacher:Something times five is going to give me 100,5
teacher:You were giving me the numerator so we were miscommunicating Kai because I was asking for what did you multiply by;student:No its 38,5
teacher:How are you feeling,5
teacher:How could you turn 40100 into a decimal,5
teacher:Martin what have you got,5
teacher:He was super close he just needed that extra;student:He was super close,5
teacher:The first time I go there arent a lot of pizza options there are inbetween pizzas theres not a lot that I like so I grab two pieces if I grab two pieces what fraction of the pizza did I take,5
teacher:Then I go and I eat my two pieces and Im feeling good but Im watching and I see that theyre bringing more pizza out and then Im Oh my gosh I really like that kind of pizza and uh that pizza has pepperoni and that one has sausage and green chili I think I need one of those Lets say I go back up and I get three more slices of pizza what fraction did I grab,5
teacher:5 times what equals 10,5
teacher:Nine what,5
teacher:If I had to draw this out using flats longs and babies what would I draw for this,5
teacher:What does that look like,5
teacher:Whats our smallest one,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Martin what do you think,5
teacher:If you eat 26 is that more or less than half of the pizza;student:Because you only ate two out of six pieces of the pizza,5
teacher:I actually wouldve put this one before I decided 26 because this is close to 12 so I wouldve said I have my smallest I have my biggest and I have 12 and then Id ask myself is 26 greater or less than 12;student:Yes,5
teacher:34 is it greater or less than 12,5
teacher:What do we notice when we see that first set of fractions,5
teacher:Hey Diana thank you for listening and paying attention what do you notice,5
teacher:Number two what do I notice about my fractions,5
teacher:My numerators are all the same and Im comparing the size of my denominators and I know the bigger the denominator;student:The numerators are all the same,5
teacher:When I get to number three what do I see,5
teacher:I see hundreds;student:Hundreds,5
teacher:When you multiply by 10 you add a;student:Yes,5
teacher:What do we get if we have the fraction 7500 what does that look like as a decimal,5
teacher:What strategy are you using to go from fraction to decimal,5
teacher:You think you know what our smallest one is;student:Edith youre shaking your head over there,5
teacher:What are some things that youre talking about at your table,5
teacher:Good next;student:520,5
teacher:Okay followed by;student:The next one would be 320,5
teacher:What do they have in common;student:Yes,5
teacher:so because 110 has the biggest denominator it is in fact the smallest fraction so whats next,5
teacher:Harley which ones next,5
teacher:Then;student:19,5
teacher:16 and then;student:16,5
teacher:13 and then;student:13,5
teacher:Somebody tell me how they did this how would you decide,5
teacher:If I look at 7500 how many wholes do I have,5
teacher:What were you thinking,5
teacher:What do you think made it so easy,5
teacher:How did we start,5
teacher:Renata howd you start,5
teacher:Im getting 5 here 7 1 3 19 pieces so the smallest amount that I could get is what,5
teacher:We talked about our smallest whats our biggest,5
teacher:I found my smallest I found my biggest whats going in between,5
teacher:What would go next,5
teacher:Jade what were you thinking,5
teacher:Your order is right but what did you do,5
teacher:How many tens do I have,5
teacher:How do I write this as a decimal,5
teacher:12 divided by 2 is,5
teacher:In order to make a fraction what do I have to do,5
teacher:You have to have a denominator of 10 or;student:You have a point,5
teacher:What makes more sense to go to 10 or to go to 100,5
teacher:We could go to 100 by multiplying by,5
teacher:However when we write this 610 looks like,5
teacher:60100 looks like,5
teacher:How many,5
teacher:How many,5
teacher:How did we get 610 here;student:How would you get the six how would you get the twos to make 610,5
teacher:How did we get these two;student:How did you get those twos that are three,5
teacher:How many slices is this cut up into,5
teacher:I know my fraction down here is going to be 100 out of how many pieces do I get,5
teacher:How many do I get;student:Eight,5
teacher:If I have 8100 what does that look like as a decimal,5
teacher:Grenada what did you do,5
teacher:Whats our decimal,5
teacher:What did we get,5
teacher:Now can I turn it into a decimal;student:Yes,5
teacher:Emmanuel what did you get,5
teacher:If I give you the decimal 062 whats that going to look like as a fraction,5
teacher:What does this look like as a fraction Eva,5
teacher:What if I give you that,5
teacher:What fraction do we have,5
teacher:What if I give you 003,5
teacher:If I give you 003 what are we looking at,5
teacher:How many babies;student:Seven,5
teacher:What do we get,5
teacher:What do we get,5
teacher:What does my denominator have to be in order to go to a fraction,5
teacher:What can I do,5
teacher:What do I have to do to 20 to get a hundred,5
teacher:Times what;student:I am going to have to times,5
teacher:Whatever I do to the bottom;student:Times five,5
teacher:10 x 5 2 x 5 what do I get,5
teacher:What do we get,5
teacher:That makes us three thirds or;student:That makes a whole another,5
teacher:Use a tape diagram to help you solve what is 13 of each,5
teacher:5 and 23 but when I think about related to the fabric how much of the fabric does it represent;student:5 and 23,5
teacher:How many rides can I go on total,5
teacher:For this Im really just looking for a general sentence thats like What are we doing when were solving for any number of rides,5
teacher:Now what am I subtracting those six points from,5
teacher:Whats that,5
teacher:A hundred what;student:A hundred,5
teacher:How can I turn that into an equation,5
teacher:We could say well Ian,5
teacher:How would we create part of a yes,5
teacher:You said N is the whats N,5
teacher:P equals,5
teacher:Since were trying to stay away from the multiplication symbol how can I rewrite this,5
teacher:Now very quickly just to finish up how does cost per ride appear in the equation,5
teacher:What part of the equation is cost per ride,5
teacher:What part of this whole,5
teacher:How many points per ride is 6N or R,5
teacher:How many more rides can I take with 10 points,5
teacher:Last bit how does the number of bonus points of the start appear in the equation,5
teacher:Howd you get 16,5
teacher:Well how many rides can I go on with my card,5
teacher:Could be said a million like What do you think,5
teacher:Whats the scenario here,5
teacher:What is it doing,5
teacher:Whats happening to your card,5
teacher:How many points is it going to take off my card,5
teacher:What is it doing,5
teacher:What do you notice from five to seven,5
teacher:What am I taking away,5
teacher:If I take away 12 what do I have,5
teacher:So 7 to 10 how many rides have I taken,5
teacher:Im taking away how many this time,5
teacher:Eighteen and then I end up with,5
teacher:Fiftyeight take away 18,5
teacher:Then 10 to 15 how many rides have I taken,5
teacher:How many points is that off,5
teacher:If I know its six points each per ride and its a hundred points on my card the equation were about to create would help me solve Well how many rides can I go on,5
teacher:What part of the equation that we created,5
teacher:What part of the equation shows the number of bonus points at the start,5
teacher:Now when we think of this equation right here what is the part we know first,5
teacher:I want you to write on your board what are some things that an architect needs to consider when they are planning to build a gingerbread house,5
teacher:Okay tell me one thing an architect needs to consider when theyre building a gingerbread house Maddy,5
teacher:What are some measures,5
teacher:I wonder if someone can add on to Sarahs answer what kind of measurements does an architect need to consider,5
teacher:How long or wide the gingerbread needs to beMia,5
teacher:What about another measurement of space,5
teacher:When were measuring volume what exactly are we measuring,5
teacher:Write on your board what exactly do we measure when we are measuring volume,5
teacher:Chloe tell me when you measure volume what are you measuring,5
teacher:Tell me more about what you mean when you say timesing it out length width and height;student:Miss volume,5
teacher:Yes youre measuring inside and what are you specifically measuring;student:It means youre measuring the inside of a threedimensional shape,5
teacher:What are some ways that weve measured volume in our class before,5
teacher:What are some tools or strategies that weve used,5
teacher:What I want you to think about today as youre building or after youre done building your house what kind of tools you might use to measure the volume,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:What did we say;student:Fifteen,5
teacher:You guys in back totally thought about this and I love it is that when I have zero points left how many rides have I taken,5
teacher:Now what number would this be,5
teacher:So at zero rides this is zero how many points do I have,5
teacher:Whats the independent variable and whats the dependent variable,5
teacher:What depends on the other thing,5
teacher:Whats the independent and whats the dependent,5
teacher:What do you think Serena,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:What would that graph look like,5
teacher:Where would it start,5
teacher:What are you doing,5
teacher:What does it do,5
teacher:If my N is zero wheres my points left,5
teacher:So think as rides increase whats happening to your points that are left,5
teacher:So what does that look like,5
teacher:Youre saying thats a hundred rides number of rides and youre saying points left is,5
teacher:So if weve done zero rides how many points do we have on our card,5
teacher:Its great but I wasnt looking for that specific just a general Hey what would happen to the line;student:This is good then,5
teacher:As I go this way as the number of rides that Ive taken increases what would I expect to happen to my number of points left,5
teacher:I always say What if I went on zero rides,5
teacher:Which one of these is Verizon,5
teacher:Which one of these is ATT,5
teacher:Which of these equations is each of these scenarios,5
teacher:Silas what do you notice,5
teacher:Yes what do you notice about the numbers;student:Yes what do I notice,5
teacher:Roge what else,5
teacher:Okay so how did you get that;student:50 people voted and in  a hundred,5
teacher:If were wondering about the support for the gym were really looking at the yeses so what fraction of people were okay with the building of the new gym,5
teacher:Now when were thinking about percents if I said Oh well what is this as a percent,5
teacher:What does cent mean,5
teacher:If 31 people for every 100 people vote yes then this equals 31 percent of percent so what do we when we dont have a 100 people,5
teacher:Well were really keeping it the same its true but were going to just put different clothes on it anyways so we can look at it so Michelle how could we do that;student:We have to really keep it the same,5
teacher:Okay so whats the percent for Miya,5
teacher:34 its that easy so which community is more in support of building the gym,5
teacher:The sportswriter for East Middle School newspaper wanted to report the percentages of fans for each school use the ratio table to account for a total of a hundred spectators so we now have how many spectators at the game,5
teacher:400 divided by two gets us to 200 our goal is 100 so this is a great step Im just doing what I can do mental math to get where I want to go okay so what did you do then,5
teacher:Okay so now we have one more jump what would be the last jump,5
teacher:Oh yes Whatd you figure out;student:We decided to calculate that percent,5
teacher:Okay so looking at these numbers what do you notice thats useful about them that will help us in thinking about what percent which community had a higher percentage of people who were in support of the gym,5
teacher:The table shows the results of the survey decide which neighborhood is more enthusiastic about building a new gym,5
teacher:Okay 60 how did you get that;student:60,5
teacher:What percentage,5
teacher:Well if they made 200 out of 240 so go back to our fundraising balls how many pieces is this broken into,5
teacher:So what do you see there,5
teacher:No you see some numbers and then what do you see in the numbers;student:Nothing,5
teacher:So what is in this column,5
teacher:So Team 1 made 200 out of 240 freethrows so how can you use that information,5
teacher:What can I do with that bar,5
teacher:What do I know,5
teacher:So if Im going to go from 200 spectators down to 1 River what am I going to do;student:Yes 83,5
teacher:What do I see,5
teacher:So what did you get for that Angel,5
teacher:What did you get for 240 divided by 6,5
teacher:Margo whatd you do,5
teacher:What would be a reasonable estimate do you think,5
teacher:I know a bunch of you have some really good ideas because I walked around the room I didnt get everywhere but dont be shy but for Team 1 what do you feel would be a reasonable estimate,5
teacher:What would be a reasonable estimate for a percentage of freethrows for Team 1 Paulina;student:Yes,5
teacher:Its a little bit more so what would it be exactly halfway between the two of them,5
teacher:How can I figure out where 200 is on that bar,5
teacher:What kind of tools could you use,5
teacher:Now that were here it says what percentage of fans at the basketball game were East fans,5
teacher:Whats the ratio of East to West fans,5
teacher:Now were at 80 so how much more do we need to get to 100,5
teacher:How are you guys doing,5
teacher:Remember that were always trying to get out of 100 because then we know what the percentage is because  We know what it is by 20 so were looking to get to that  Whats a nice jump from 20 to 100,5
teacher:Now if I know Im going to pretend theres 100 students in the class so I need to multiply this 20 x 5 what do I do with these numbers,5
teacher:Think of equivalent  When we multiply the denominator by five what do we do to the numerator,5
teacher:Make one five times bigger what do you have to do to other one to make sure that  fractions,5
teacher:What are simpler ways to get from 20 to 100,5
teacher:What are some good ways to get there,5
teacher:What percent of the gymnastics meet were East fans I guess we would call them,5
teacher:Howd you get that;student:I got 75,5
teacher:For instance for ATT when they charge three cents per text message if I send two text messages how much am I spending,5
teacher:If I send one text message with ATT how much does it cost,5
teacher:Three cents but if I send one text message with Verizon how much does it cost;student:Three cents,5
teacher:If a company has that upfront cost what does that mean for whos the better deal and when,5
teacher:Theyre the same at a thousand but really whos the better deal at 999,5
teacher:This times two is,5
teacher:Then were going to do what sort of jump  times two again,5
teacher:What would you get to;student:Yes,5
teacher:Sitting back and hanging out and you dont know what  Whats your strategy,5
teacher:How else could I write that,5
teacher:So if I say write a comparison statement for this ratio what were you about to say,5
teacher:What if I said write it as a ratio,5
teacher:To start if this is the ratio like the base ratio how many people are they talking about,5
teacher:Now remember if youre trying to figure out percent you want per how many,5
teacher:Clay if you want to get to percent you want per how many,5
teacher:So start there what do you need to do,5
teacher:All right whats the percent of West fans,5
teacher:So whats a good way to get from 20 to 100,5
teacher:Samuel is going to talk to you about  and how he interpreted that,5
teacher:What have you guys got,5
teacher:Whats the relationship between 20 and 100,5
teacher:So what do we do with the top numbers,5
teacher:Times five whats 20 x 5,5
teacher:How is that going to break,5
teacher:Right or 20 x 4,5
teacher:What do you know about the relationship between 20 and 100,5
teacher:If Mr Calis used 13 of the fabric how much would he use,5
teacher:Tell me a little bit more about that;student:Yes,5
teacher:What did you say Maria,5
teacher:Rachel tell me what you did,5
teacher:Did you use anything other than adding fractions to help you though;student:Yes,5
teacher:Lindsay or  tell me a little bit more about what you did next with the pictures,5
teacher:Maggie tell me what you did;student:I kind of had a picture but I just basic I mostly had arrows,5
teacher:We need to solve what is 35 of 35,5
teacher:What is the whole,5
teacher:What is the whole number in this problem,5
teacher:How many units should we cut the 35 into,5
teacher:what do you think,5
teacher:How can you find the value of one unit,5
teacher:What is each one of these worth,5
teacher:How many of those five parts do we need to put together,5
teacher:What is 35 of 21,5
teacher:No what is 35 of 35,5
teacher:Tell me another way I could solve it;student:Its another way that you could solve it,5
teacher:If you didnt use this strategy what did you do,5
teacher:Before you start Yes very important how many white roses did she buy;student:How many roses did she buy,5
teacher:Lindsay where did you start,5
teacher:What does that look like,5
teacher:All right were going to wrap up in just a minute but what are your thoughts on the new sailboat that you built,5
teacher:Paulas table what mistake did I make,5
teacher:Borrow from the 8 it becomes a 7 then what,5
teacher:Tell me what I need to do next,5
teacher:Now you just told me that 24  18 equals what,5
teacher:This is 2 and,5
teacher:What is the need to simplify or reduce;student:I dont remember doing that,5
teacher:Do you know what it means to simplify or reduce a fraction,5
teacher:Tell me what that means;student:Reduce a fraction I might know,5
teacher:Do you know what it means to reduce or simplify a fraction,5
teacher:How many boxes of each flavor did Mr McCourt buy,5
teacher:How many boxes of each flavor did Mr McCourt buy,5
teacher:Tell me how you figured it out already;student:I already  figured it out,5
teacher:Mr McCourt did what,5
teacher:How much juice was there,5
teacher:I want to hear where you started first,5
teacher:Before you start solving think what do you know about this problem already,5
teacher:What do you already know about this problem,5
teacher:Turn and tell a thought partner at your table what do you already know about this problem,5
teacher:If youre stuck and this is a little bit confusing this problem what could you do,5
teacher:All right Maggie I see you drew your tape diagram and you split it into how many parts;student:I,5
teacher:Whats the whole,5
teacher:John can you show Chris what a tape diagram is what it looks like;student:This is complicated,5
teacher:You know what else is an odd number;student:Its an odd number,5
teacher:What are the two whole numbers that we could skip count by three to get to that 17 is in between,5
teacher:15 and 18 so if I count by fives Jeremiah 5 10 15 three fives whats left over;student:15 and 18,5
teacher:What am I going to do with the remaining two,5
teacher:What would you do with the remaining two,5
teacher:What do you think Lindsay;student:Then you make  because I can put in one and turn it into,5
teacher:Jeremiah what did you do,5
teacher:Who can answer that,5
teacher:How much fabric did Mr Calis use in his quilt Angela,5
teacher:How many yards of fabric did Mr Calis use to make a quilt,5
teacher:What does each of these boxes in the tape diagram represent,5
teacher:Whats something that you could draw strategy that weve learned just today,5
teacher:Hey Angela what do you think youll draw to help you solve this problem,5
teacher:What can you draw to help you solve this problem;student:It seems like its kind of like,5
teacher:What is left over after we account for the 18 red roses,5
teacher:What do you know about this problem;student:6 yes,5
teacher:What do you know about this problem Paula,5
teacher:What do you notice about what  diagram,5
teacher:How many of the roses were red,5
teacher:How many roses 18 roses are red,5
teacher:How can you find how many are white,5
teacher:The rest how many are left;student:Wait 18,5
teacher:When might someone have to do this in real life,5
teacher:Six left so how many roses are;student:Think outside the box,5
teacher:What do you add to 34 to get,5
teacher:wants to come up and draw it,5
teacher:Paula will you come up and draw your tape diagram,5
teacher:How many pieces;student:Four,5
teacher:You know what else I can do;student:Because 24 is equal to 4 because it goes up like 4 8 12 then 16 then,5
teacher:What did the question want you to find out,5
teacher:The rest how many are white;student:It wants you to find out,5
teacher:We know 34    what,5
teacher:When would someone use this,5
teacher:If 0 is the first point how far will you travel on the xaxis,5
teacher:How much taller;student:Because its the yaxis and if youre going to multiply that its going to get taller,5
teacher:It was 23  59,5
teacher:What two numbers will you multiply together,5
teacher:What is that,5
teacher:Now what,5
teacher:Tell me what I need to do to the denominator,5
teacher:Sorry the numerator,5
teacher:Harper what do you think,5
teacher:What did I multiple five by to get 30,5
teacher:Six so now I need to also multiply 3  6 and that is;student:Six,5
teacher:What did I multiply six by to get 30,5
teacher:I also need to multiply one by,5
teacher:Then I can add 1830  530 is,5
teacher:Im listening for a correct answer,5
teacher:Do you know what that is,5
teacher:That means I need to multiply seven times what,5
teacher:Can you show the class how you solved the problem,5
teacher:69  59 is,5
teacher:Whats this fraction,5
teacher:Now youre going to take the two numbers two fractions with common denominators which are what,5
teacher:Can you share what you told me about the Smarties,5
teacher:Remind me again what the word equivalent means,5
teacher:Tell me what the word multiples means,5
teacher:Clarry tell me some more,5
teacher:When I skip count by one how much do I increase each time,5
teacher:Skip count by five starting with five,5
teacher:Five,5
teacher:What will I multiply the numerator of this fraction by;student:What did you get,5
teacher:Skip count by eight starting with eight,5
teacher:23  59,5
teacher:23  59;student:Thats easy,5
teacher:Prove it to me,5
teacher:Whats the new fraction,5
teacher:Tell me what you need,5
teacher:Starting,5
teacher:So did you look at the larger denominator then and you noticed that;student:Do you like pizza or,5
teacher:Which fractions have the same denominator,5
teacher:Sharks mini marshmallows or Smarties,5
teacher:Which strategy do you want to try multiples or the quick common denominator,5
teacher:Hey Caleb what strategy do you want to solve,5
teacher:8 1 5 1  plot a point at that point,5
teacher:Can you plot 5 1,5
teacher:All right Liz can you tell Louis again what happens when you multiply by zero,5
teacher:Can you tell me more precisely what that looks like when its way bigger,5
teacher:Before you plot the points I want you to make a conjecture or a prediction  math what do you think the new sailboat will look like,5
teacher:What  the size of this grid;student:Kind of like  like a surfboard with a sail on it,5
teacher:What do you know about math,5
teacher:What did you find out;student:I finished that sailboat,5
teacher:Just bigger but how much bigger;student:Its the same thing just bigger,5
teacher:How will it look different,5
teacher:What are you starting to notice about the sailboat,5
teacher:How much bigger,5
teacher:What makes,5
teacher:How much wider is it,5
teacher:What do you think is going to happen in  sailboat number three,5
teacher:Wheres the X at,5
teacher:What will that look like when you plot the sailboat,5
teacher:How,5
teacher:Bigger in what way,5
teacher:Which strategy do you want to solve or use while youre solving the problem,5
teacher:Did you use the multiples or quick common denominator;student:What Im using is Im multiplying,5
teacher:Who can solve using multiple skip counting,5
teacher:Braxton you want to try,5
teacher:Anybody else for multiples and skip counting,5
teacher:What fraction is that,5
teacher:Alicia what do you notice,5
teacher:How did you find that;student:23  23,5
teacher:What did you come up with Harper;student:Me,5
teacher:What numbers are you referring to,5
teacher:The quick common denominator strategy what two numbers get multiplied together,5
teacher:So what should be your first step Marianne;student:No,5
teacher:These are the two numbers you want to multiply together so nine times what,5
teacher:Yes and three times what,5
teacher:What is the first number in this pair,5
teacher:Find seven on the xaxis,5
teacher:Which numbers need to be changed,5
teacher:How many yards do I need;student:A whole,5
teacher:Yes nay,5
teacher:What did we get,5
teacher:Where is the seven;student:I thought it was 14 7,5
teacher:What is the seven,5
teacher:Is the seven laps run or money earned,5
teacher:Seven and how much money did he earn,5
teacher:What are the coordinates buddy,5
teacher:Wheres your seven and 14;student:7 and 14,5
teacher:What are the pairs,5
teacher:Did you have to look at the context and what it was being given;student:Yes,5
teacher:How did you do that,5
teacher:How did you do that,5
teacher:Who can tell me,5
teacher:How do you made sense of it,5
teacher:Then you had to interpret the;student:Yes,5
teacher:The rule that was being used in order to write the That was the word;student:The coordinates,5
teacher:Did you have to estimate things,5
teacher:What are you doing way over here buddy,5
teacher:What are you missing,5
teacher:What would be the right answer;student:No,5
teacher:What would be my next number here,5
teacher:How do you know hes going to turn 15,5
teacher:How many laps is he running here,5
teacher:Whats it doing,5
teacher:Whats that X coordinate doing,5
teacher:How many is it going,5
teacher:Okay so what number is going to be here,5
teacher:None of that makes sense so how do I make this make sense;student:No,5
teacher:What did you just do,5
teacher:What did you just do though,5
teacher:What number do you always graph first;student:No,5
teacher:If hes earned 14 how man laps does he earn,5
teacher:This goes up by how many,5
teacher:If he ran four laps and earned 8 how many laps does he have to run to earn 14,5
teacher:What one do you log first,5
teacher:What do you notice about these right here,5
teacher:Can that be the right answer if theyre looking for how many laps he ran with to earn 14;student:Yes,5
teacher:If the book has 17 chapters on what day would Clay complete the book,5
teacher:What were the answers that you came up with,5
teacher:What is the rule being applied here;student:I got seven,5
teacher:Wider is that going to be this way or this way,5
teacher:If I look at this and I double zero whats it going to be,5
teacher:If its and I double that it would still be,5
teacher:Whats our next point,5
teacher:If I double that what would it be,5
teacher:Am I doubling both of them Sarah or one of them,5
teacher:What is our next coordinate,5
teacher:what would that be doubled Helen,5
teacher:I would be what;student:Five and,5
teacher:whats the next one,5
teacher:What is that coordinate grid,5
teacher:If I double that Danni whats it going to be;student:Well because,5
teacher:Am I doubling both or just one;student:Well its going to be,5
teacher:Okay so what would it be;student:Just the one,5
teacher:Okay if Amy uses her rule what do you think the new trapezoid will look like,5
teacher:Okay and Ms Matty give me the last one;student:I think its a yes because 45 x 9 will give you plus eight,5
teacher:Georgia what about the second one,5
teacher:Is it greater than 45 x 9 and how do you know,5
teacher:Is the value without solving it greater than 45 x 9,5
teacher:How many chapters a day does she finish,5
teacher:Six times three is 18 so would it be six or would it be five and a half;student:Three three a day,5
teacher:If we were looking for exact but does the question ask us about exact or does it say about,5
teacher:What would the number be;student:finish it on day seven,5
teacher:How many chapters does he read a day,5
teacher:What did you get,5
teacher:Thats why I was curious as to how you guys 09 because what happened to your seven;student:I got 397,5
teacher:What am I going to do with this one;student:Three,5
teacher:No but if youre rounding to the nearest hundredths what place value did you look at;student:My seven that was my hundredths,5
teacher:Whats my picture on the coordinate grid going to look like,5
teacher:Its got to get,5
teacher:What is the rule Kayla,5
teacher:What is the rule,5
teacher:A rule in mathematics would be what Hudson,5
teacher:What would that rule contain,5
teacher:What does greater than mean Finn,5
teacher:Whats the next one,5
teacher:How many years did it take for him to turn 11,5
teacher:Three years so if I do eight and I use the pattern if this guy is going to up by that how old is this one going to be when that happens;student:Three years,5
teacher:How many years is it going to take him to turn 11,5
teacher:Wider and;student:Wider,5
teacher:All right friends these are what type of fractions,5
teacher:All right once again what type of fractions are those,5
teacher:What are we turning these improper fractions into everyone,5
teacher:All right go ahead Mariah tell us what you did and how you got your answers,5
teacher:The first one what was the action,5
teacher:Okay what about the next one;student:Then you have 12 leftover so I did one and 12,5
teacher:Can I get you to use some math vocabulary,5
teacher:What is this called,5
teacher:This part of the fraction is called the what;student:A denominator,5
teacher:What is this part called;student:Denominator,5
teacher:Tell us what you did,5
teacher:Can you show me what you wrote at the bottom of your whiteboard;student:Then I got 3 23,5
teacher:What do these words mean to you,5
teacher:If you consistently get threes and fours what does that tell me about your understanding,5
teacher:Yes because it got;student:Yes,5
teacher:Okay and what am I doing with the Y coordinates;student:Coordinate X,5
teacher:What coordinate is that,5
teacher:What is the first number called;student:Doubling like this,5
teacher:What coordinate is that;student:The X so now Im going to Y,5
teacher:What coordinate is the eight,5
teacher:What coordinate is not,5
teacher:X is what;student:The Y,5
teacher:What are we doing with the X coordinate,5
teacher:What are we doing with the Y coordinate;student:Were doubling that,5
teacher:What are we doing with this one,5
teacher:What do you get,5
teacher:What coordinate are we doubling,5
teacher:What are we doing with the X;student:The Y,5
teacher:What about the original,5
teacher:Heres 10 where is 2,5
teacher:What coordinate always goes first Chloe;student:Okay,5
teacher:Wheres your 02,5
teacher:Where is 02 Penny,5
teacher:What are we doing,5
teacher:What coordinate are we doubling;student:Double the second number of the original pair leave the first number the same,5
teacher:What is it going to look like,5
teacher:If youre consistently getting twos what does that tell me,5
teacher:How are these scales relevant,5
teacher:What do you notice about the points,5
teacher:What do you notice,5
teacher:What do you notice about the points you just plotted,5
teacher:Bruce what do you notice,5
teacher:What are the numbers doing;student:Yes,5
teacher:When Lilith was eight years old how old was Noah,5
teacher:How old was Noah,5
teacher:When Lilith was eight years old how old was Noah,5
teacher:River I want you to explain yours the exact way you did when I was listening and then Hudson the same thing,5
teacher:How did we determine her age down here,5
teacher:How did we answer this question,5
teacher:Roberto how did we answer question A,5
teacher:No how did you answer it,5
teacher:Now Finn I need to know how old Lilith with be when Noah is 11,5
teacher:How old will Lilith be when Noah is 11,5
teacher:What do you notice about what you just plotted,5
teacher:Where did you get the eight,5
teacher:How do you write those are ordered pairs,5
teacher:How do we write those are ordered pairs,5
teacher:Quickly before I go any further do a turn and talk with your neighbor about when Im reading a grid what coordinates what is my rule for writing the ordered pairs and then graphing them,5
teacher:How do I graph them,5
teacher:What coordinate do I have to graph;student:You look at the right coordinates,5
teacher:Xaxis and that number always goes;student:The Xaxis,5
teacher:Stella whats our rule,5
teacher:Always start with the X what;student:Our rule is always start with the X and then the Y,5
teacher:How do I know what way the X coordinate goes,5
teacher:If you get ones what does that tell me,5
teacher:Where are my numbers from the X coordinate,5
teacher:Give ya wow thats some great language wasnt it,5
teacher:Do Sarahs ordered pairs model the data,5
teacher:Mr Roberto what do you think buddy,5
teacher:What is this right here Roberto,5
teacher:What is this,5
teacher:What one does not represent what is there,5
teacher:How do you write those in ordered pairs,5
teacher:Where are my numbers from my Y coordinate,5
teacher:What coordinate is that,5
teacher:What is going to happen to the shape,5
teacher:What is the trapezoid going to look like and what are those letters going to look like,5
teacher:Go back and show me where is;student:No were supposed to connect them,5
teacher:Where is the zero on the X coordinate,5
teacher:Zero on the X coordinate Matty,5
teacher:Wheres the six on the Y coordinate Matty,5
teacher:Where is the 30 on the Y coordinate,5
teacher:Now where is the six on the X coordinate,5
teacher:Where is the 30 on the Y coordinate at six,5
teacher:Im not going to put a California queen in my bedroom if my bedroom wasnt that big because what am I going to have,5
teacher:Marcuss going to share out what happened and how his thinking should have changed go,5
teacher:I asked Marcus now what should that have triggered everyone,5
teacher:What work did we discuss Jared;student:Yes,5
teacher:Where else Kayla do you revise work in your life,5
teacher:Where else do you do it,5
teacher:Specifically where in school,5
teacher:No when do you revise things in your life;student:Does it have to be at school,5
teacher:So why are you putting the Y first,5
teacher:Hudson when do you revise things,5
teacher:Matty what one always goes first,5
teacher:Where would  be,5
teacher:Because he did both it made it taller and,5
teacher:Now did it fit on a folder or did it look like an ant on that folder;student:Yes,5
teacher:Okay so going back to how can I make the problem how can I understand the problems to make it fit the space I need to make it fit;student:It looked like an ant on that folder,5
teacher:If I have to arrange my bed on this rug is it going to be easier for me to arrange my twinbed and dresser or my queen or doublebed and dresser;student:I have a twin bed,5
teacher:If my rule to double it didnt make it big enough what rule could I use,5
teacher:Any questions on what you should be doing;student:Okay,5
teacher:What is the first number,5
teacher:What is a better way,5
teacher:What is a better way for you to make yours work,5
teacher:X only by five and what do you think the outcome is going to be;student:We all make mistakes,5
teacher:Matty whats 1x6,5
teacher:Wheres the zero on the X coordinate and where is the six on the Y coordinate;student:Then 0 all the way up to 30 up there and then six,5
teacher:Thats the X coordinate where is the zero on the X coordinate,5
teacher:Where is your Y coordinate,5
teacher:Where is the six,5
teacher:Wheres your,5
teacher:When you said you revise things at home what do you revise at home,5
teacher:What does the word revise mean Hudson,5
teacher:When do you revise things;student:Something I make changes,5
teacher:My friends I know you have resources at your seat but reminder this is the tens ones and then to the right of the decimal is what;student:Seventy and fivetenths,5
teacher:All right Georgia would you read for us what you have please,5
teacher:How would you read it;student:Like the numbers or how do you read it,5
teacher:How did you know it was 90;student:90 and three tenths,5
teacher:This one starts with a six in the,5
teacher:Then we know we go to the hundredths so we know that you have at least how many places to the right of the decimal,5
teacher:Franc would you share your thinking with the class please,5
teacher:What were you thinking,5
teacher:How many longs,5
teacher:How many longs are you going to shade right now,5
teacher:Then how many twos;student:Four,5
teacher:Whats different in the subtraction,5
teacher:Are you noticing that you need to do something just a little bit different,5
teacher:Missy and Georgia will you tell us what you noticed and what you were talking about thats different in subtraction,5
teacher:Subtraction is doing what;student:If you shade in both of those amounts youre adding because putting two parts together is adding,5
teacher:How do we read this number,5
teacher:What should you have on your whiteboard if you have a seven in the tens and you have a five in the tenths,5
teacher:What number does that represent,5
teacher:Now Clay my question right now for you and your partner is how do you know your answer is correct;student:We got 41710,5
teacher:What did we look at;student:A B and C,5
teacher:What were we able to determine by looking at their work,5
teacher:What else;student:If they were right or wrong,5
teacher:What do you mean what they did;student:What they did,5
teacher:What did they use,5
teacher:Im looking for that Rword,5
teacher:How are you going to solve it,5
teacher:06,5
teacher:What are you going to do,5
teacher:How did you get that in the journal;student:Yes,5
teacher:Im hearing you say 14 is equal to 28 and you can do 2838 and what would you get;student:If its a different denominator wouldnt you try and make the 14 into 28,5
teacher:Whats 85,5
teacher:So what would a coach be doing right now to support,5
teacher:Okay so whats the first line of the question asking you to do,5
teacher:Whats 45,5
teacher:Clay would you please read your final product;student:You added the 1 here and then we knew 212 so we added 8 to the 2 right because we added the 1 here,5
teacher:Would you share with us the other answers that you got and we can see if we agree;student:1214 we knew that 12 equals 24 and then 241434,5
teacher:All right so new book he multiplied the X coordinate by six so lets look 62,5
teacher:They asked you to create a rule that enlarged it and this person said,5
teacher:To change the coordinates this way;student:To do what,5
teacher:Rewrite your answer using the speci,5
teacher:What is happening to what you thought,5
teacher:So what word do you need to change;student:Wider,5
teacher:What was your misconception,5
teacher:Did you change your thinking on how you were going to do this,5
teacher:All right so now my friends understanding that you had to write a rule to make something wider I have to double what;student:Yes,5
teacher:If I want to make it not only wider but bigger what do I need to do,5
teacher:So my friends this is,5
teacher:Take turns sharing out at your table when your table has let everyone share out sentence starters pick one that you would like to start out with,5
teacher:Okay give me a sentence starter;student:No,5
teacher:Okay a rule Jake can use to make the book larger is What else should I hear in this sentence or in my explanation;student:A rule that Jake can use to make the book larger is to,5
teacher:How is he going to make it bigger Nivea,5
teacher:Okay because the book is going to get twice as;student:The coordinates,5
teacher:All right so now the next one is describe what you think the new picture will look like be specific;student:Yes,5
teacher:A rule Jake can use to make the book larger is to,5
teacher:Okay where is my  going,5
teacher:Okay where is my  going,5
teacher:Okay where is my  going,5
teacher:If we do this I should be able to move this where is my  going,5
teacher:Okay write what the new trape What would the new trapezoid numbers be if Im doubling the X coordinates,5
teacher:Whats the only way I can make it taller for you;student:It doesnt make any sense because its bigger and you cant make it that way because then it would be taller,5
teacher:What would I have to do to go tall,5
teacher:What do I have to double,5
teacher:If I doubled this one and it made it wider what do I have to double to make it,5
teacher:What coordinates am I doubling;student:to make it taller,5
teacher:What are those coordinates called Helen;student:All three of them,5
teacher:Describe what the new picture can look like will look like be specific about how you think the book will change;student:Double Y and Y coordinates,5
teacher:This is the X and whats this one,5
teacher:Danni and Jacob come over here please and explain,5
teacher:Explain to the class how you answered this first question,5
teacher:Okay but her rule was what;student:I think this because if you dont want the trapezoid to be tall but when you also make it wider it kind of looks small,5
teacher:What was the rule that she used Jacob,5
teacher:Okay so the question is if Amy uses her rule what do you think the new trapezoid will look like;student:I think this because if you dont want the trapezoid to be tall but you dont want it to seem tall so when you  you want it to be wider and it gets wider and it gets smaller at the same time,5
teacher:If Im doubling something how much bigger is it getting,5
teacher:How many of you were that specific;student:Yes,5
teacher:Okay friends I am going to ask Danni and Jacob to please come up and explain your thinking,5
teacher:What is her trapezoid going to do and what is that RC going to do,5
teacher:That book is going to get,5
teacher:Hes writing can you tell me what your answer from question one and two,5
teacher:Kayla what did we create,5
teacher:We had to come up with something before we could create the diagram,5
teacher:Who can talk to me about what we had noticed though once we created that book,5
teacher:Who can talk to me about that,5
teacher:She said that we talked about that we had enlarged it two times bigger but sizewise What did it look like in comparison to a folder,5
teacher:What does it mean to revise,5
teacher:Clay what does it mean to revise,5
teacher:Then wheres the one,5
teacher:So if our first coordinate was 02 how many spaces are between 0 and 2 on the X coordinate,5
teacher:Two okay and then if our next coordinate was 20 how many spaces are in between there;student:Two,5
teacher:What is the space difference between that do you think,5
teacher:Whats the space difference,5
teacher:How many boxes are in between,5
teacher:How many squares are in between each,5
teacher:Would it have been easier or harder;student:Yes,5
teacher:What did we have to create,5
teacher:We did talk about bigger but what mathematical terms did we use,5
teacher:All right Matty give me a term that we used when we were talking about enlarging something,5
teacher:Okay we use terms like what;student:Bigger,5
teacher:Okay so then what did you do,5
teacher:So what should you have been doing Hellen,5
teacher:Are you noticing anything,5
teacher:Adam can you think of a way that would keep you keep inner track of what youre doing,5
teacher:What do you think thinking about your rule could you have done differently,5
teacher:Thinking about your rule what could you have done differently to make an actual folder art,5
teacher:Whats wrong with my rule;student:Okay then  to,5
teacher:Or twice as;student:Twice as large,5
teacher:Hes looking for folder art whats wrong with this,5
teacher:Whats another rule we could have tried;student:Because,5
teacher:If you did it by four how big is it though,5
teacher:Theyre all going to look like that because none of you thought to do anything but;student:Yes looks like that too,5
teacher:If I want something bigger so Danni you guys did times what;student:No,5
teacher:Could you come here with the points please;student:No we put the points there,5
teacher:Hey so where are they at,5
teacher:Yesterdays success criteria the learning intention is I will develop and apply a rule to enlarge a picture on a coordinate grid and enlarge meant get,5
teacher:Whats wrong with my rule,5
teacher:What is that called;student:Youre doubling this one this one and this one,5
teacher:What coordinate am I doubling;student:Rule double the first number of the original pair leave the second number the same,5
teacher:X coordinate and what coordinate is not changing;student:X,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:Keith what did you do,5
teacher:Now we have 100 and for our numerator we have for our numerator we have,5
teacher:Now what,5
teacher:The number one rule when were adding and subtracting fractions is that what has to be the same,5
teacher:Walk me through it Sonia,5
teacher:Is it equal to onehalf,5
teacher:We know that 5 is half of 10 but we also know that we could divide how many times,5
teacher:When we see this whats the first thing we have to do,5
teacher:Ever whats the first thing you think we should do when we look at adding and subtracting fractions,5
teacher:Change the what,5
teacher:Looking at our fractions which one would you change,5
teacher:Caleb what would you change,5
teacher:Because you know that 3  3 is going to give you;student:Because if you multiply 3  3  9,5
teacher:Whats our new fraction,5
teacher:Whatre we measuring in what is our whole;student:How much pepper did Caleb add to the cheese mix,5
teacher:Now what do we do,5
teacher:Were talking about precipitation but how are they measuring precipitation,5
teacher:What is our unit,5
teacher:What did we have to do,5
teacher:How much pizza is left over,5
teacher:Eva What do you think,5
teacher:We didnt add them this time we did what,5
teacher:Somebody walk me through this,5
teacher:Kaylee says our denominator stays the same so we keep our 12 and we just look at five minus two and get;student:Five take away two is three,5
teacher:Jade walk us through it,5
teacher:Okay what about our denominators;student:The answer is 4500 feet if you do if you subtract 67 from 22 its 45,5
teacher:Okay how do we feel,5
teacher:How much fabric does she have left,5
teacher:How much fabric does she have left,5
teacher:Eli walk me through it,5
teacher:Whatd you do,5
teacher:You got;student:I took 78 and then minus 58 and then I subtracted 75,5
teacher:On average how much more precipitation is there in February than in January,5
teacher:What are we talking about,5
teacher:Whats our second step here Hailey,5
teacher:This one were going to add but what are these numbers,5
teacher:What part of our fraction are they Judith,5
teacher:Now what,5
teacher:Now we have to go back to;student:We have to change,5
teacher:What am I going to do Renata,5
teacher:How did you turn the mixed number into an improper fraction,5
teacher:Now what;student:Mmhmm,5
teacher:Now what,5
teacher:Now what,5
teacher:Now you got to turn it into a mix,5
teacher:Ms Hernandez is looking out for me,5
teacher:What do you know about division,5
teacher:Allie what do you know,5
teacher:When we talk about multiplication we say multiplication is similar to repeated,5
teacher:Is it the same or its the;student:Its the same as multiplication,5
teacher:Anything else you can add,5
teacher:When we think about groups is there another thing where were putting things into groups,5
teacher:Two times five is,5
teacher:So what do we need to do,5
teacher:Plus two is;student:Three,5
teacher:One times three is,5
teacher:Whats my first step,5
teacher:Ally whats my first step,5
teacher:The question is how do I make it 12,5
teacher:What is my new numerator;student:You also do it to the top,5
teacher:Now what Israel,5
teacher:My final fraction is,5
teacher:Whats the hard part about this,5
teacher:We did it this morning,5
teacher:Renata what makes it tricky,5
teacher:Whats different,5
teacher:Whats different;student:Theres a mixed number,5
teacher:Viviana whats different,5
teacher:Judith how would you change our steps for this,5
teacher:Judith says First lets make it improper then lets check our denominators then we can add and possibly we might have to go back to what,5
teacher:We decided our first step should be to make it,5
teacher:Times three plus two;student:Yes,5
teacher:So youre making your denominator,5
teacher:What else do we know about adding fractions,5
teacher:What else is true,5
teacher:Eric whats something thats true when we add fractions,5
teacher:Judith what do you think,5
teacher:In order to go from two to four I have to,5
teacher:Whatever I do to the bottom,5
teacher:One times two is;student:Add it to the top,5
teacher:What kind of fraction could we cover that with,5
teacher:Wheres the eight,5
teacher:How many eighths do you want to use Jahaira,5
teacher:What else do we need,5
teacher:What other factions of these can we add,5
teacher:What fraction were those pieces;student:We need a whole,5
teacher:How can I manipulate my fractions to prove it here,5
teacher:What do you think Judith,5
teacher:4   4 is,5
teacher:8   4 is,5
teacher:What could I divide that;student:Yes,5
teacher:One half plus one fourth plus one fourth,5
teacher:Anybody else has a part,5
teacher:Haley what do you think,5
teacher:Martin we use our model what does that equal,5
teacher:Whats different;student:I want to see what happens,5
teacher:What did I tell you we have to have in order to add,5
teacher:How can I make my denominators the same;student:I have an answer,5
teacher:Xavier can I make my denominators match,5
teacher:How,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:In order to change this to a 10 I have to,5
teacher:5   5 is,5
teacher:Multiply by two whatever I do to the bottom;student:Multiply by two,5
teacher:What do I get;student:Yes,5
teacher:Ali what does it say,5
teacher:Eli do you want to start with something like what kind of fractions you want to add,5
teacher:What else could we add to this fraction,5
teacher:What else could we add,5
teacher:Two of them or one of them,5
teacher:If I put one half plus one fourth plus one fourth what does that equal,5
teacher:12 is;student:I do to the top,5
teacher:What about fractions,5
teacher:10   by 5 is;student:One,5
teacher:Equals;student:Two halfs,5
teacher:Jade tell me how you did this or whats your thoughts,5
teacher:Jahaira says she has another way Jahaira what did you do,5
teacher:So the queen got 12 queen has 12 and then,5
teacher:The oldest sister got 24 and what did the other two sisters get;student:24,5
teacher:How many sisters are there,5
teacher:What fractions are we adding here what is my fraction equation that you wrote Caleb,5
teacher:And if it was that how do I find the common denominator because right now my denominators dont match how could I make them match,5
teacher:What is the lowest number they have in common,5
teacher:How do I go from two to eight,5
teacher:Two times,5
teacher:Whatever I do to the bottom;student:Four,5
teacher:What do I need to do to four to make it eight,5
teacher:Whatever I do the bottom;student:2 x 2,5
teacher:When you add all that up what do you get,5
teacher:Before we start with fractions tell me Im sorry before we start subtracting fractions tell me what we know is true when we are adding fractions,5
teacher:How much does each one get;student:This,5
teacher:What are the fractions,5
teacher:How can she make this happen,5
teacher:How can she split up the rest of this land for her other two daughters,5
teacher:Whats a diagram,5
teacher:Nobody knows what a diagram is,5
teacher:What does it equal;student:I proved it because it is bigger than  because 12  13  13 does not equal a whole,5
teacher:What does it equal,5
teacher:What do I need to do in order to add these fractions together,5
teacher:Hayley what do we do,5
teacher:In order to add my fractions together which one do you choose,5
teacher:12  12;student:Two,5
teacher:What do I need to do to two to turn it into six Emanuel,5
teacher:Whatever you do to the bottom;student:Six,5
teacher:Whats our numerator;student:You do to the top,5
teacher:I am hearing it what do I need to do to my three,5
teacher:We are going to multiply by two whatever I do to the bottom,5
teacher:Eli what do you think,5
teacher:Whats my numerator going to be,5
teacher:I need to add 36  26  26;student:Three,5
teacher:2 x 3 is,5
teacher:Any other guess;student:Yes,5
teacher:12 divided by 3,5
teacher:12 divided by 3;student:Its easy,5
teacher:What way did that go,5
teacher:Because horizontal is;student:No vertical,5
teacher:What do you notice about that stop sign,5
teacher:Tera what did you guys notice about my images,5
teacher:Our coordinate grid spread it;student:This ones more wider to the one  bigger than that one,5
teacher:Which made the top go;student:Wider,5
teacher:It expanded vertically and it shrunk,5
teacher:Where do you think youre going to draw the math message or plot the math message;student:Original sailboat,5
teacher:What are these called,5
teacher:Where is your first grid,5
teacher:Then what do you do,5
teacher:Kayla what did you just get up and grab,5
teacher:What do you think that tells us that we have to do;student:I thought it was a trick question because it keeps on asking eight one to five one,5
teacher:What one did you start with,5
teacher:Okay so what do you need in order to connect those Clay;student:Yes,5
teacher:What rule,5
teacher:Clay what rule did we talk about when you ordered those pairs,5
teacher:What did you have to use first,5
teacher:Im splitting the granola bars among how many people,5
teacher:How many teaspoons of flavoring will he need for three batches of his new flavor,5
teacher:Kayla what do we do if we disagree on a problem,5
teacher:How will we redo it Kayla;student:redo it,5
teacher:How would you write that number of model,5
teacher:Whats going to happen if I do that,5
teacher:Were going to end up with,5
teacher:What kind of a division problem do you think is that one,5
teacher:What do you need,5
teacher:What kind of a problem did you notice in the division problem that will come close to,5
teacher:Then whats that,5
teacher:What story do you think about when we were working on fractions and we were dividing things,5
teacher:What number story could you come up with that would allow you to divide fractions for an item into that would come out to be 35,5
teacher:Youre dividing it between how many people,5
teacher:What could you use,5
teacher:Five,5
teacher:Five granola bars or am I splitting the granola bar into something,5
teacher:Youve said you knew that was what,5
teacher:Two times three is;student:Because two times three is six,5
teacher:Where did everybody just jump up and get Clay,5
teacher:I have to go from 81 to,5
teacher:What coordinate;student:The one on the left,5
teacher:What coordinate are we doubling,5
teacher:What coordinate is that;student:Eight,5
teacher:What am I doing with the Y coordinate,5
teacher:So what do you think is going to happen here;student:No,5
teacher:Whats going to happen to my boat do you think;student:Okay,5
teacher:Whats the original pair;student:Double the first number of the original pair leave the second number the same,5
teacher:What coordinate am I doubling,5
teacher:What is that called,5
teacher:What am I doing with the Y coordinate,5
teacher:What do you think is going to happen to my boat now,5
teacher:Whats the original pair;student:Double the first number of the original pair leave the second number the same,5
teacher:What coordinate am I doubling,5
teacher:What coordinate is that;student:The eight,5
teacher:No is the;student:16 is it,5
teacher:So what are we doubling;student:Double the first number of the original,5
teacher:How are you doing this one Lisa,5
teacher:If we attach a zero it makes it bigger if we have a number in front of it but if were multiplying by zero 00 is,5
teacher:Anything times zero is always;student:It would be zero because if you do 01,5
teacher:To;student:51,5
teacher:Where is your zero X coordinate;student:like this,5
teacher:Thats your X coordinate but where is the zero,5
teacher:Okay where;student:Right here,5
teacher:Where is your one,5
teacher:Where is your Y coordinates,5
teacher:Where is one;student:Here,5
teacher:Remember when we are talking about ordered pairs what does it tell us we have to do,5
teacher:Where is your Y coordinate,5
teacher:Now I would like Lisa to show us his sailboat,5
teacher:Could you please show Lisa how he needed to connect the coordinate grid 12 to coordinate grid 51,5
teacher:Roberto if I double eight and  what do I get,5
teacher:16 because eight plus eight is,5
teacher:Or 82 is,5
teacher:12 is,5
teacher:If I double something Miriam if I double something what should my shape do,5
teacher:Please show us your sailboats,5
teacher:What fraction,5
teacher:Judith help us out what do you think,5
teacher:If Im going to multiply 210 times 3 what would I get using some of the thinking that people already shared with us,5
teacher:Ezra what do you think,5
teacher:You asked yourself the question 30 times what is going to give me 1500,5
teacher:You know that this 0 would take care of this 0 so 3 times what gives me 15,5
teacher:5 and I need to add,5
teacher:What is 24 divided by 8 Fiona,5
teacher:What would that be,5
teacher:The last one number seven says What strategy did you use to solve problem number five,5
teacher:How many flowers are there in all,5
teacher:Tell me what you drew,5
teacher:Okay so tell us a little bit about what you drew;student:And the I tried to have,5
teacher:Josh and Jaher both talked about a simpler way multiplication but we know that multiplication is just repeated,5
teacher:Some of you might have had the equation of four plus four plus four plus four equals,5
teacher:How would we add that information to the picture that Josh already drew,5
teacher:How could we add that to the picture that Josh already drew,5
teacher:Ty what do you think,5
teacher:What are we thinking,5
teacher:How many 30s are;student:0,5
teacher:Subtract another 30;student:30,5
teacher:Subtract another 30;student:Equals 60,5
teacher:Do you know what 12 divided by 3 is,5
teacher:Kai what are you thinking,5
teacher:We can think about the opposite of this 4 x 3,5
teacher:We could subtract 3 until we get to How many 3s did we take out,5
teacher:I have 12 dots 3 dots in each circle and I ended up making,5
teacher:Amanda what do you think,5
teacher:20 divide by 5 is,5
teacher:If a florist has three vases of flowers how much soda is needed to keep them fresh,5
teacher:Eli whatd you do,5
teacher:Jaher what do you have,5
teacher:Who else has a strategy,5
teacher:15 divided by 3 is 5 15 divided by 5 is,5
teacher:Whats our answer,5
teacher:Sonia what did you write down because I think that might help Emmanuel out too,5
teacher:What are some of our other methods for solving division,5
teacher:What else could we use,5
teacher:All right who thinks they have an answer,5
teacher:Who has an answer,5
teacher:Emma what do you think,5
teacher:How much soda Put it away;student:We put 34,5
teacher:Two times three equals;student:Two times three,5
teacher:How many teaspoons does she need;student:No,5
teacher:How many teaspoons of cinnamon flavoring oil are needed for five batches,5
teacher:If I were to add to figure out my answer what would I have Marty,5
teacher:What did you get for an answer for that Marty;student:18 plus 18 plus 18 plus 18 plus 18 plus 18,5
teacher:Did anybody figure out a multiplication equation for that,5
teacher:Ally what did you get;student:Ally,5
teacher:What answer would I get,5
teacher:Is there a shortcut way to skip this but still figure out this,5
teacher:Is there a shortcut way to skip the addition ingredient and head straight to the multiplication,5
teacher:Any ideas,5
teacher:What kind of a cheat could we use,5
teacher:Renata what do you think,5
teacher:So now what do you think,5
teacher:So when were multiplying all we should mess with is our;student:Yes,5
teacher:How would we show that using a multiplication equation Aylec,5
teacher:What is three plus three,5
teacher:How can we represent that using addition,5
teacher:Two groups of;student:Two,5
teacher:Am I going to put into this vase,5
teacher:How much soda;student:Oh,5
teacher:am I going to put into this vase;student:14,5
teacher:How much in this one;student:14,5
teacher:What kind of an equation did you write for this,5
teacher:Judith what did you write,5
teacher:Okay so Judith says we could do 14 plus 14 plus 14 equals;student:14 plus 14,5
teacher:Before we get to any answer though what would that look like in the picture,5
teacher:Vivianna what do you think,5
teacher:Using drawings words and equations to represent the problem Yasmine made two batches of lip balm how many teaspoons of almond oil did she use,5
teacher:How many teaspoons of almond oil does it take,5
teacher:Three teaspoons for what,5
teacher:How many batches is she making,5
teacher:How many batches is she making,5
teacher:What would we need here,5
teacher:How many groups;student:One,5
teacher:Yes the only difference is;student:Yes,5
teacher:Now what is the shaded rectangle,5
teacher:Team 1 what fraction,5
teacher:How do I find them using decimals,5
teacher:Who can tell me what that number is;student:Yep,5
teacher:Who can tell me what that number is Mr Jonathan,5
teacher:What place value is that zero in,5
teacher:And what place value is the four in;student:Ones,5
teacher:So what is the answer;student:Tens,5
teacher:Whats the first one worth,5
teacher:Now that I changed it,5
teacher:Whats the first one word Leslie,5
teacher:Now whats it worth Vianay,5
teacher:How can it still be worth four I added all those zeros,5
teacher:Did you put your hand down unless your name is Vianay Vianay hows it still four,5
teacher:What do you mean no;student:No,5
teacher:What is it;student:No,5
teacher:How do we say that one,5
teacher:Which is written like that,5
teacher:What is that number Valentina,5
teacher:How do we say that one;student:Yes,5
teacher:You cant tell me what that number is,5
teacher:But what are zeros,5
teacher:That makes sense because what place value on our place value chart is the one in,5
teacher:So what does this mean when we see zero and onetenth,5
teacher:How many wholes do we have,5
teacher:What would three tenths look like as a fraction,5
teacher:Ten what about the three;student:Ten,5
teacher:What would our denominator be,5
teacher:You just said it what would our denominator,5
teacher:So our denominator is going to be 10 because its broken into 10 pieces and what would our numerator be;student:Ten,5
teacher:And three what;student:zero and three does the zero,5
teacher:How would you say that decimal Alex,5
teacher:You just said it how,5
teacher:So how many wholes do we have Brody,5
teacher:And three what;student:And three but,5
teacher:So if you didnt hear what Deneli said she just asked well what happens when it gets to the hundredths,5
teacher:And zeros are worth what,5
teacher:Who can tell me what that number is,5
teacher:How would we say that one,5
teacher:What is it Tati,5
teacher:But now what place value does that zero go to,5
teacher:Miss Gaby what do you think,5
teacher:So how does that work,5
teacher:So Mr Alex in the number 40 hundredths how many total pieces of pizza are there;student:Yes,5
teacher:How many are we eating;student:There are 100 pieces of pizza in there,5
teacher:Mr Ishmail in the one on the left four tenths how many total pieces of pizza do we have,5
teacher:How many total pieces of pizza do we have Ishmail;student:Forty,5
teacher:Oy yi yi Deneli how many total pieces of pizza do we have in that one,5
teacher:Ishmail Kim just said 10 because what does the denominator tell us Ishmail,5
teacher:We have 10 slices of pizza total and Mr Ishmail how many do we want to eat,5
teacher:No but they are;student:No,5
teacher:We keep coming back to that word equivalent because thats whats important understanding that they are an equal,5
teacher:How is it equal though,5
teacher:And this is the question that I asked over here here how many slices are we eating,5
teacher:How many here;student:Four,5
teacher:So how is four equal to 40 and this is what Gaby was trying to help us understand;student:Forty,5
teacher:So how are we saying theyre equivalent,5
teacher:But how could they be equivalent,5
teacher:So how on earth could those be the same,5
teacher:In the blue box what do we want to eat,5
teacher:Its not hundredths anymore its the next one over say it,5
teacher:What is 100 times 10,5
teacher:Whatever you do to the bottom;student:100000,5
teacher:So what is four times 10;student:You must do to the top,5
teacher:We talked about this yesterday but they are,5
teacher:What does theyre not the same mean,5
teacher:How are they different,5
teacher:What do we always what word do we always use for the decimal point when naming decimals,5
teacher:Jessica what do you think,5
teacher:Now obviously youre never gonna cut a pizza up into 100 or 1000 slices hopefully that would take a while and you wouldnt get much food but if we cut this pizza up lets start with this first one how many total slices would there be Vianay,5
teacher:The one in the box how many total slices would there be,5
teacher:And how many of those pieces Damian do we want to eat,5
teacher:Damian how about this in the red box,5
teacher:We want to eat 40,5
teacher:40 what what are we eating;student:Thousand,5
teacher:So we want to eat 40 slices of pizza out of;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Tati what do you think,5
teacher:So we have how many wholes,5
teacher:So thats an awesome example did you just tell me parts of a whole or parts of a set;student:And youre doing it you could do it in three minutes and when the three minutes are up you only got one out of the ten,5
teacher:Of;student:I have another example,5
teacher:What did we have to multiply there,5
teacher:By what show me,5
teacher:Missing denominator for number three Isaiah,5
teacher:Missing for four Tati;student:Six,5
teacher:Good missing for five Emiliano;student:12,5
teacher:No now they changed it up instead of missing our denominator theyre missing their;student:No,5
teacher:All right number six our missing numerator Kim was,5
teacher:So you did it right so what does that equal,5
teacher:This one that you have written two times two;student:Ten,5
teacher:So Kim you did it absolutely perfectly you just wrote down 10 so we had to multiply by two so then on number seven Deneli whats our missing denominator,5
teacher:Valentina missing denominator on eight;student:Twelve,5
teacher:What do we multiply by five to equal 10;student:Sixteen,5
teacher:Five times what,5
teacher:Five times 10;student:Ten,5
teacher:Five times what equals 10,5
teacher:Monique what is our missing denominator in number two,5
teacher:Good and then;student:Because one times six is six,5
teacher:Multiplied by;student:Because on the top I on the top I multiplied six,5
teacher:12 how did you figure that out;student:12,5
teacher:What should you definitely use,5
teacher:Which math tool,5
teacher:Which one of those things will make you more successful,5
teacher:Avery  can you share your thinking,5
teacher:What was the goal of last nights homework,5
teacher:What were you trying to accomplish,5
teacher:What does it mean to be an equivalent fraction,5
teacher:Yep whatever you do to the top;student:Two,5
teacher:Vianay what is an equivalent fraction,5
teacher:But what does that actually mean,5
teacher:What does it mean for one fraction to be equal to another,5
teacher:Okay so think back to our pizza demonstration from yesterday Mr Jonathan if I eat one half of a pizza that is cut into four slices how many slices do I have to eat to eat half of the pizza,5
teacher:Two what;student:Um two,5
teacher:Ok but what if you eat one;student:Because if you eat three then youre going to have one piece left over,5
teacher:If its only cut into two slices how many of you have to eat,5
teacher:What was the answer for the missing denominator on number one Damian,5
teacher:Now what do you mean equal;student:An equivalent fraction is we looked at so if one fraction can be equal to another fraction,5
teacher:But when were dealing with fractions they can be because what matters is the size of the;student:No,5
teacher:So what is six times two;student:You do to the bottom,5
teacher:And finally number 10 Delilah,5
teacher:Whats the first one;student:Theyre a part of the other numbers,5
teacher:Whats the second one;student:Tenths,5
teacher:What would the next one be;student:Hundreths,5
teacher:Lets start with how do you say a decimal versus a fraction,5
teacher:Alright so if someone came into this classroom right now that has never worked with fractions before could you tell them the name of that fraction the name of that fraction,5
teacher:Could you do it,5
teacher:What does one out of 10 or one 10th mean,5
teacher:What does one out of 10 mean,5
teacher:Ishmail what does one 10th mean,5
teacher:Can you add a little bit more detail;student:One tenth is like how many slices of your pizza,5
teacher:Can you give me an example be more specific,5
teacher:But remember fractions are not just parts of wholes they are also parts of,5
teacher:Sets and what is a set;student:Sets,5
teacher:Raise your hand what is a set Emiliano,5
teacher:What is a set,5
teacher:So does anybody now remember what makes a difference between a decimal and a fraction,5
teacher:The answer should be zero and five,5
teacher:Gaby take a guess,5
teacher:So all those things we talked about yesterday equivalent fractions what is the numerator what is the denominator what do they stand for and how do we adjust them or manipulate them,5
teacher:So those we had to use what,5
teacher:What is the first factor pair we all should know,5
teacher:Is there anything we can multiply by two to equal 56,5
teacher:But if we multiply two times what Gaby,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:What do you have to do to get from two to four,5
teacher:What about this one;student:What about this one Mr C,5
teacher:12 All right number nine Abner what is our missing denominator,5
teacher:Miss Jessica please give me one factor pair for the number 30,5
teacher:So what is one of the missing ones Leslie,5
teacher:And our final missing one Miss Kim,5
teacher:All right so the final question on the paper is the number 30 prime or composite,5
teacher:What does composite mean,5
teacher:So a composite number is any number that has more than,5
teacher:Two factors ok What is it called when it only has two factors;student:Two factors,5
teacher:What do we multiply by two to equal 12,5
teacher:So what would our first factor be,5
teacher:Remind me what should you make sure you definitely use if you are still feeling like you add maybe a two on this,5
teacher:So if we think of our two pizzas how big is a slice of pizza if its cut into 10 slices,5
teacher:If its already in tenths its easy but I want to see if you can figure out or have strategies to figure out well what do we do when its not cut into 10 pieces nice and easy,5
teacher:So number two Mr Jack what two fractions are we trying to compare on number two,5
teacher:Onehalf and what;student:Onehalf and oneninth,5
teacher:Alright Miss Laurie what is number two,5
teacher:What two fractions are we comparing,5
teacher:So if I multiply three times eight Isabelle what Mr Parker I get,5
teacher:So whos going to come up and teach it,5
teacher:Who can explain it,5
teacher:Alright lets see if Robin can explain it,5
teacher:Come teach us,5
teacher:But the problem is what can we multiply times three to equal 16,5
teacher:The answer is,5
teacher:Whats three times 5,5
teacher:Whats three times 6,5
teacher:What can we multiply 24 by to equal 48,5
teacher:24 times two is,5
teacher:Whats three times 8,5
teacher:So from here Miss Polly please finish the problem and explain to us what youre doing,5
teacher:List your,5
teacher:So if you cant think right away of what the common denominator is going to be what should you do,5
teacher:If we have a pizza and it is cut like this and we eat this much of the pizza how much have we eaten,5
teacher:So now what is it,5
teacher:Jack what is it now,5
teacher:What did we actually do,5
teacher:So what happens,5
teacher:So raise your hand if you can tell me what nine times eight is,5
teacher:So guess what were going to do today,5
teacher:Now number one if you look at it what can you tell me about number one,5
teacher:So it has a common,5
teacher:Most of you already know that onehalf is larger than onefourth but I want you to prove it to me,5
teacher:So whats our common denominator,5
teacher:Whats one we could use,5
teacher:We could multiply them both together and get what,5
teacher:What were my directions Mr,5
teacher:Jack what were my directions,5
teacher:What did I show you yesterday you should do,5
teacher:How did we get to where were at so far,5
teacher:So which ones bigger;student:To get to 24 on this side we multiply by eight and we have to do that to the top and 2 times 8 is 16,5
teacher:Alreya please tell me which two fractions we are comparing in number 3,5
teacher:And what is 12 times two,5
teacher:Miss Jessica what do I multiply 12 by to equal 36,5
teacher:So what must I multiply 11 by;student:Three,5
teacher:And if I multiply 11 times three what do I get;student:Three,5
teacher:All right Miss Laurie what did you do,5
teacher:Explain to your group what you mean by a denominator of twelve,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Anybody think they can explain,5
teacher:What do you mean because its a denominator of twelve;student:Because its a denominator of twelve,5
teacher:So what are you trying to accomplish by multiplying three times four;student:Because I dont have to cut it into as many pieces as you are,5
teacher:Multiples of,5
teacher:Three times what;student:Yes,5
teacher:How many multiplication facts did I have to do,5
teacher:So if we want to make our denominator four what would we multiply two by,5
teacher:So if we want to make four our denominator what do we have to multiply two by,5
teacher:So what should I multiply two by,5
teacher:Multiplied by,5
teacher:What did I do,5
teacher:Miss Georgia how did I get from three to 36,5
teacher:Whats my common denominator gonna be,5
teacher:If you look at your other fraction all you have to ask yourself is it more or less than half,5
teacher:Is seven more than half or less than half of 12,5
teacher:And now Mr Josh I have 96 as a denominator but what am I missing,5
teacher:What am I missing,5
teacher:And we know that whatever happens to the bottom has to happen to the,5
teacher:So Mr Hunter what did I multiply by eight to get 96;student:Top,5
teacher:You cant order them you cant add them or you cannot subtract them unless they are the,5
teacher:So what am I gonna multiply four by;student:12,5
teacher:Evan whats missing on this side,5
teacher:So how did I get from 12 to 96,5
teacher:So what am I gonna have to multiply seven by,5
teacher:So which one is bigger,5
teacher:Mr Abner what two fractions are we comparing on number four,5
teacher:Twothirds and;student:Twothirds,5
teacher:So Miss Marie if I were to take my two denominators here and make them my factors and multiply them together what would I get,5
teacher:And when I do what do I get;student:12,5
teacher:Equal but what did what was the one word she gave us;student:Because the denominators are not equal,5
teacher:And whatever you;student:Common denominator,5
teacher:Find a,5
teacher:So how did I say that its the right answer when I just told you that thats not the same thing;student:No,5
teacher:Its not the same but it is,5
teacher:What can I divide by both 50 and 100,5
teacher:10 divided by 10 class,5
teacher:One so 100 divided by 10;student:Ten one,5
teacher:One hundred divided by 10;student:One ten,5
teacher:Answer to number four is class zero and,5
teacher:Number 5 is zero,5
teacher:Its zero and six,5
teacher:Number six is zero,5
teacher:Number nine is the same as number five it is,5
teacher:What do you do if we have a denominator that is not so friendly,5
teacher:Like two thirds,5
teacher:So Isaiah if I were to do that how many twos are there how many threes are there in the number two,5
teacher:So what would be here,5
teacher:What is two times 25;student:You must do to the top,5
teacher:Whatever you do to the bottom,5
teacher:Four quarters so four times;student:Four quarters,5
teacher:What do you need four of to make 1 Alreya,5
teacher:So how do you say this fraction,5
teacher:Its a fraction eight out of,5
teacher:So its zero whole pizzas and,5
teacher:Eight and what place value is that eight in;student:10 eight,5
teacher:Now how do we write that as a decimal Miss Leslie,5
teacher:Zero and 8 what;student:Zero and eight,5
teacher:Zero and eight what place value as it in,5
teacher:But now how many threes are there in 20;student:Zero,5
teacher:Now many of you got this right because you know that that is equivalent to onehalf because whatever you do to the top,5
teacher:Miss Kim what is that fraction,5
teacher:Twofourths two out of;student:Twofourths,5
teacher:Four times what equals 10,5
teacher:Somebody tell me what whole number can you multiply by 4 to equal 10,5
teacher:The answer is,5
teacher:But what you can multiply to get is raise your hand when you can tell me what I multiply by 4 to equal 100,5
teacher:What do you need four of to make 1,5
teacher:It is equal to,5
teacher:Comes from because if we change the total number of slices of pizza that we have were also changing the number we have to;student:You do to the top,5
teacher:Look 20 minus 18 leaves me with,5
teacher:And these are all,5
teacher:Whats eight times 12,5
teacher:Oy yoi yoi I picked this because I know a lot of you have not been practicing your 12s like you should be,5
teacher:So how did we get to 96 on the right side of the equation,5
teacher:And how did we get to 96 on the left side of the equation and however we did it on the bottom,5
teacher:So how did you get to 96 on this side,5
teacher:What did you multiply by,5
teacher:Whatever you do to the bottom,5
teacher:So how did we make 96 on this side,5
teacher:What did we have to multiply eight by to equal 96,5
teacher:This is what your paper should look like whatever we do to the bottom,5
teacher:So if we multiply the bottom by 12 we have to multiply;student:You must do to the top,5
teacher:The top by a 12 Who can tell me raise your hand what six times 12 is;student:The top,5
teacher:Marie I know youve been working on your twelves what is six times 12,5
teacher:Now we must go to the other side and Alreya when we got 96 on this side what do we have to multiply times 12 to equal 96,5
teacher:Eight so whatever we do to the bottom;student:Eight,5
teacher:What is my denominator gonna be,5
teacher:But remember you must not only do the denominator because whatever you do to the bottom,5
teacher:Perfect well not six times nine were doing denominators multiply;student:Multiply 6 times 9,5
teacher:Whats the cheat you can always use that Mr Parker work Marie,5
teacher:How many times does three go into 10;student:Zeros,5
teacher:Whats three times three;student:Three,5
teacher:Leaving us with;student:Nine,5
teacher:How many times does three go into 10,5
teacher:What do we need four of to make 1,5
teacher:What do we need four of to make 1;student:Four of,5
teacher:What,5
teacher:How many times does three go into one;student:Oh because six divided by 2 is 3 and then its not,5
teacher:The cool way to think about this is does anybody know how you write the amount for a quarter,5
teacher:This one is called greater than,5
teacher:Is ninetwelves greater than sixeighths less than sixeighths or equal to sixeighths,5
teacher:Regardless what is the right answer,5
teacher:Is it greater than is it less than or is it equal to,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:Okay so if thats true what what must we do to find the right answer,5
teacher:Does anybody remember and I showed it to you briefly yesterday at the end of the day what the cheat was that I showed you you could do if you cant figure out what the multiples are of both,5
teacher:Exactly because you need four quarters to make 1 and you only have how many of them;student:So you just technically imagine the four like a quarter,5
teacher:We want to make four the denominator what do we multiply two by to equal four,5
teacher:What about the bottom one please,5
teacher:What does she need to do with 112 Ava;student:Light green,5
teacher:Gabby can explain your thinking here,5
teacher:You know what;student:Then you know that,5
teacher:Lydia the 13 and the 14 are what colors;student:You take 13 and 14 and a few of your 112 and see how many 112 can go into a 13 how many 112 can,5
teacher:The 112 is which color,5
teacher:What does she need to do with 112 Lydia;student:Light green,5
teacher:After that whole long spiel that gets us to Our answer was,5
teacher:What about the bottom one please,5
teacher:Remind me what should you make sure you definitely use if you are still feeling like you add maybe a two on this,5
teacher:What should you definitely use,5
teacher:Which math tool,5
teacher:Which one of those things will make you more successful,5
teacher:Ari  can you share your thinking,5
teacher:What do you think it means to justify your thinking,5
teacher:Sawyer what do you think,5
teacher:Luke what do you think about that,5
teacher:Okay so that looks like its going to be how many 112,5
teacher:Tell me about paraphrasing,5
teacher:Like what smaller fraction fits evenly into both of those,5
teacher:13 is how many 16,5
teacher:The next step is 24 plus 14 equals what was our answer,5
teacher:Now what about this one,5
teacher:What color are the 110,5
teacher:Ari can you explain how you got your answer to this one,5
teacher:How many of the 18 fit onto a 12,5
teacher:How many of the 18 fit onto a 12,5
teacher:Okay so if you have 48 plus 38 how many eighths would you get,5
teacher:How is this problem different from other problems we did,5
teacher:Okay because last before if we explained how did the other problems work;student:Because 13 and then 12,5
teacher:What were you able to do with the other problems,5
teacher:Whats different with this one,5
teacher:Now what do you think about having a mixed number as a numerator;student:So when you trying doing 12 its going to be one and a half of that,5
teacher:What do you think about that Theo,5
teacher:Okay I know not everybody might be totally finished but can I have Adam share your thinking for me please,5
teacher:How do you use the 14 pieces,5
teacher:Then you had 36 plus 26 equals,5
teacher:How many miles would we drive all together,5
teacher:How many miles would we drive all together,5
teacher:Tell them how many miles,5
teacher:What is important from this question,5
teacher:Whats your answer going to be in this;student:How much should he get and how much she could give to Tasha,5
teacher:How many pieces so your answer is going to be;student:How may pieces,5
teacher:What expectations do you think I have for solving this problem,5
teacher:What do you think my expectations are for doing this work,5
teacher:What else do you have to do to be successful as a mathematician on this problem,5
teacher:What else do you think I need from you,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:What about the people who are like But I just know the answer or  know the answer,5
teacher:What about that,5
teacher:What am I going to tell those people,5
teacher:How else;student:Theyre going to just think  Oh,5
teacher:What else besides me is it important to show your work;student:When theTmarks it you have,5
teacher:What is something weve had to do a lot of this year in math;student:To add on to Elizas even if you know what it is you should draw a model just so that you know  right,5
teacher:What did you get and how did you get it,5
teacher:Then theres one other Isaiah;student:They each tried to get how many pieces they could,5
teacher:What is important here,5
teacher:Whats the important part about that;student:What fraction of the chocolate bar will Nick and Tasha use in total,5
teacher:Tell me Damien what information do we need to know,5
teacher:I drove 2000 miles and my sister drives 500 miles,5
teacher:What if I said I spent 200 on Christmas gifts and my cousin spent  200 on Christmas gifts,5
teacher:How much money did we spent total,5
teacher:Luke what are you thinking,5
teacher:What are you thinking Bella,5
teacher:How far did we drive all together,5
teacher:How far did we drive all together,5
teacher:What did you do first Isaiah,5
teacher:Blake what do you think,5
teacher:If I was all the way to my parents house how far are we already;student:No,5
teacher:What fraction of students play these two sports,5
teacher:Luke what do you think about this first one,5
teacher:How many students wore tennis shoes,5
teacher:What important information do we have just from that;student:Tasha will only eat a smore that is made with exactly 25 of a chocolate bar,5
teacher:Just from that what important information do we have,5
teacher:Is 12 and how much,5
teacher:Bella I know your little brain wants to add these two together what do you get if you add those two together,5
teacher:Now what did you do first,5
teacher:28 plus 18 is,5
teacher:When we did 14 plus 18 what did we get,5
teacher:Okay and then how did you find the denominator;student:I thought about it as I saw theres 24 and 23 so I multiplied the numerators together to get the numerator of 4,5
teacher:Okay so what is my number sentence;student:I agree,5
teacher:Royce whats my number sentence,5
teacher:412 or;student:24 x 23  412,5
teacher:How did you know how to do your tickKingslys,5
teacher:Laura how did you do your tickKingslys for vertically,5
teacher:What about horizontally;student:Vertically right above the zero I did 16 as the tickKingsly and I kept going up until I got 66 for full,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:How do I find my area now,5
teacher:Six so you noticed how many were shaded in,5
teacher:Six and then how many squares are there in all;student:Six,5
teacher:We have 34 x 26 which is just what we just said 624 or it could be reduced to,5
teacher:What do we notice vertically our rectangle goes up by,5
teacher:What does our rectangle go horizontally by,5
teacher:Now whats the next part we need to shade in,5
teacher:What else did you think about it when you were doing numerators;student:We did 24 x 23,5
teacher:How did you find the numerator Martine,5
teacher:Okay what is the area,5
teacher:Horizontally the rectangle was shaded to what Frankie;student:24,5
teacher:How am I going to find the area the product,5
teacher:Whats our numerator going to be,5
teacher:How many squares are shaded in,5
teacher:Three and what is our denominator going to be meaning squares and all;student:Three,5
teacher:34 x 14 equals,5
teacher:What are the dimensions of the shaded rectangle,5
teacher:Youre basically doing what by what,5
teacher:How many did I double shade,5
teacher:What by what;student:24 by,5
teacher:What do you notice about vertically and horizontally;student:No 44 by 14,5
teacher:What do you notice when the shaded rectangle goes up to this shade,5
teacher:Okay and then what do you notice horizontally;student:You multiply,5
teacher:So what do you notice,5
teacher:Vertically what does it go up by,5
teacher:Horizontally what does it go up by;student:Fourths,5
teacher:Vertically the shaded rectangle went up to what River,5
teacher:So what do you think,5
teacher:Can someone answer that JD;student:I have a question because I thought we were only supposed to solve A B and C but I dont get how they got 910 when its 15,5
teacher:Kathleen how many squares are there altogether;student:One,5
teacher:What is our answer,5
teacher:If we have two glasses of water and we divide those in half what is our quotient going to be,5
teacher:What is our quotient going to be,5
teacher:Kimber what is your quotient going to be,5
teacher:What do you think I expect,5
teacher:Who can remind me what quotient means because Ive been saying that,5
teacher:If she cuts pita bread into fourths how many pieces of pita bread will she have to share,5
teacher:Which one of those is bigger,5
teacher:Which one of those is bigger;student:Yes,5
teacher:Which one of these is bigger,5
teacher:12 is greater because we know that 28  18 equals,5
teacher:And 12 is;student:38,5
teacher:Is it more or less than 13;student:Yes,5
teacher:What do we think,5
teacher:Okay and;student:It was 18,5
teacher:What did we find;student:Yes,5
teacher:Theres two glasses of water and theyre dividing those two glasses of water into what Ember even though youre raising your hand,5
teacher:Laila tell me one thing you notice,5
teacher:What do you notice about this picture,5
teacher:When I say visual models what do I mean,5
teacher:First vertically how am I going to fill in those tickKingslys Maeve,5
teacher:How many squares do you notice,5
teacher:Now horizontally,5
teacher:Now what do I need to shade,5
teacher:Whats my numerator whats my denominator,5
teacher:Kingsly whats my numerator,5
teacher:How many squares are there altogether,5
teacher:How many squares are there altogether Kathleen,5
teacher:Jeff what is my denominator going to be,5
teacher:Down if you think its going to be less than to the side if you think its going to be equal to up if you think its going to be greater,5
teacher:Who remembers the math term for this problem,5
teacher:Multiplicative Gavin;student:I dont remember the other two words,5
teacher:What does multiplicative identity property mean;student:Multiplicative identity property,5
teacher:Thumbs up for greater thumbs to the side for equal to thumbs down for less than,5
teacher:What is less than,5
teacher:When I say visual models what do I mean,5
teacher:Number two is 78   23 going to be greater or less than or equal to 78,5
teacher:After that whole long spiel that gets us to Our answer was,5
teacher:What were the two fractions we were adding;student:In order to add the fractions you have to give them the same denominators so thats why we multiplied and then found the 910,5
teacher:How many pieces should he cut the bar into,5
teacher:How does this picture show an algorithm,5
teacher:So if you needed to from the hexagon,5
teacher:Claire tell me what you re thinking,5
teacher:What is fluency Audrey,5
teacher:What shape was shaded in,5
teacher:Someone tell me,5
teacher:All right number two;student:Then four times three that would be 12,5
teacher:What s the first step we need to do,5
teacher:If we are finding 34 times 23 what s the first step we need to do,5
teacher:So you did these lines and then what did you have to do with those Claire,5
teacher:Then this way what do we have in this direction,5
teacher:So then what do I do,5
teacher:Zoe what do I do now,5
teacher:Then if we ve done 23 times 34 how many boxes are colored,5
teacher:How many are there total;student:Six,5
teacher:Charles what did you guys discuss,5
teacher:Do you guys notice any patterns when you ve been doing this,5
teacher:How does that picture represent an algorithm,5
teacher:An algorithm Laura,5
teacher:How many coins in all,5
teacher:If I take four dolls four pennies  three sets of four coins how many coins in all,5
teacher:Eight rows of eight stamps how many stamps in all;student:Three and point four,5
teacher:Vincent what did you get for that one,5
teacher:The second one,5
teacher:How many stamps in all,5
teacher:How many oranges in all,5
teacher:Addie what did you get,5
teacher:Say that correctly please;student:I think I got 6x1 2,5
teacher:34 of a bag of 8 carrots how many carrots,5
teacher:what have you got,5
teacher:What did you notice,5
teacher:Theyre all,5
teacher:How many were left,5
teacher:What is an algorithm,5
teacher:How does that represent an algorithm,5
teacher:Have you noticed any patterns when we have been doing this,5
teacher:What do you notice there;student:You took my thoughts out of my mouth,5
teacher:What number sentence did you get Luke;student:Yes,5
teacher:Okay because last before if we explained how did the other problems work;student:Because 13 and then 12,5
teacher:What were you able to do with the other problems,5
teacher:Whats different with this one,5
teacher:Now what do you think about having a mixed number as a numerator;student:So when you trying doing 12 its going to be one and a half of that,5
teacher:What do you think about that Matthew,5
teacher:Okay I know not everybody might be totally finished but can I have Morgan share your thinking for me please,5
teacher:How do you use the 14 pieces,5
teacher:13 is how many 16,5
teacher:Then you had 36 plus 26 equals,5
teacher:Like what smaller fraction fits evenly into both of those,5
teacher:Okay so that looks like its going to be how many 112,5
teacher:Diana can explain your thinking here,5
teacher:You know what;student:Then you know that,5
teacher:Ava the 13 and the 14 are what colors;student:You take 13 and 14 and a few of your 112 and see how many 112 can go into a 13 how many 112 can,5
teacher:The 112 is which color,5
teacher:How is this problem different from other problems we did,5
teacher:Okay so if you have 48 plus 38 how many eighths would you get,5
teacher:How many of the 18 fit onto a 12,5
teacher:How many of the 18 fit onto a 12,5
teacher:What do you think the two steps of the algorithm are,5
teacher:Youre totally right that those are the two steps to find the area model but for solving the problem what are the two steps,5
teacher:In your own words what are the two steps for our algorithm,5
teacher:What did you guys write,5
teacher:Can I hear what you wrote for number one Emery,5
teacher:Henry what did you put;student:Okay,5
teacher:Zoe what did you write;student:Okay,5
teacher:How many coins in all,5
teacher:What did we find;student:Yes,5
teacher:28 plus 18 is,5
teacher:Now what did you do first,5
teacher:What did you do first Ari,5
teacher:The next step is 24 plus 14 equals what was our answer,5
teacher:Now what about this one,5
teacher:What color are the 110,5
teacher:Avery can you explain how you got your answer to this one,5
teacher:When we did 14 plus 18 what did we get,5
teacher:Then we multiply it by what Eve,5
teacher:Whats the first step you have to do Eve,5
teacher:Eve what did you get for the second one,5
teacher:Going back to our target today what is the decimal skill we are learning;student:Yes the small rectangles,5
teacher:What was our goal for today,5
teacher:What are we practicing,5
teacher:If you practice this with a whole number what do you think our next step is,5
teacher:Lets say I did 4100  210  eightones what did you notice;student:Yes,5
teacher:I want you to go back and think about the math message and how our decimal was 3121000 how else could you write that in expanded form,5
teacher:What place is that;student:No,5
teacher:in what place is the one,5
teacher:What about the two;student:The one is in the hundredth,5
teacher:Okay so will somebody share with me how you did it,5
teacher:Andrew what did you do,5
teacher:What is that,5
teacher:With brackets to the three and then what was in the bracket;student:with brackets,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:Can someone remind me what an ordered pair is,5
teacher:What happened when you were shading;student:It goes up and keeps on going up and then the number changes as you add more columns,5
teacher:Three what,5
teacher:Tell me what you mean by that;student:I noticed that the numbers kept on going up or down,5
teacher:What did you notice,5
teacher:What was your answer Henly,5
teacher:Did you have 10 pieces or did you have 110,5
teacher:Heres the question how many pieces should be cut it into so each person will get the right amount;student:If you said 110 is that equal to 10 pieces,5
teacher:When it says how many pieces even though 110 in terms of math means the same thing the question specifically said how many pieces,5
teacher:Jake what did you get for C,5
teacher:How many times,5
teacher:How many pieces of the chocolate bar should he get and how many pieces of a chocolate bar should he give to Tasha;student:It should be this and this,5
teacher:The two coordinates and theyre always in what,5
teacher:For C;student:For C,5
teacher:How many times is that,5
teacher:How many tenths,5
teacher:12 equals how many tenths,5
teacher:510 so how many pieces would Nick get;student:Five,5
teacher:Then 25 is how many tenths,5
teacher:25 is how many tenths,5
teacher:How many pieces would Tasha get;student:410,5
teacher:How many 110 did Nick have,5
teacher:Then part B Henly;student:Youre welcome,5
teacher:Can someone show me ordered pairs are always going to be in parenthesis and whats in the middle,5
teacher:This is when theyre two months old four months old six months old eight months old and on the yaxis whats on the yaxis Joel,5
teacher:If we put in 15 and took 15 of that,5
teacher:and 30 if we took 15 of that Adrian,5
teacher:In science when a system  function what does that mean,5
teacher:When the system  function in science what does that mean Brielle,5
teacher:Tell me what you remember about a conjecture or an argument;student:Yes,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:I want you guys to know what is a unit fraction,5
teacher:When I say unit fraction what is that,5
teacher:unit fraction is,5
teacher:Whats the unit fraction,5
teacher:For 35 what would the unit fraction be,5
teacher:Lets find 15 of 10 what is 15 of 10,5
teacher:Haley what was that you noted similar between 15 and 35,5
teacher:In this case what is the numerator,5
teacher:Lainie can you share what you got for 23 of 9,5
teacher:If we put in 25 and took 15 of it what will that be,5
teacher:If you put 10 in and took 15 of it what would come out,5
teacher:What do I get for this one,5
teacher:What kind of places do you need to do on math journal;student:Oopsies,5
teacher:If you go to the back and look under the graph of question B it says what does the point zero months three inches mean for a typical meerkat height,5
teacher:What does the point zero months three inches mean for a typical meerkat height,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:Partner A shouldnt ask question D at first,5
teacher:For question B what does that point zero months three inches mean for a typical meerkats height,5
teacher:When they are first born they are how tall,5
teacher:Now how tall do you think a typical meerkat gets question C;student:Two days to two weeks,5
teacher:Nora what do you notice about the coordinate grid,5
teacher:Joel whats your thought,5
teacher:We could make a prediction but if we wanted to know if it got bigger what would we have to do,5
teacher:Now at what age do meerkats reach their full height,5
teacher:Okay so Charlie is saying that it goes up until they get to;student:I know when the meerkat reaches full height because at month 14 it gets to 12 inches but all the months after that it just goes in a straight line at 12 inches,5
teacher:Any other thoughts on these three questions,5
teacher:All right Sage what did you and Melody talk about,5
teacher:Andrea what did you guys talk about,5
teacher:What did you talk about,5
teacher:What data do we have what does it show us;student:No,5
teacher:Whatever we do to the bottom What Mr Parker we get,5
teacher:What if we wanted to make four our common denominator,5
teacher:What could we multiply two by to equal four,5
teacher:how did you know that a half is right,5
teacher:Smallest what;student:Because its the smallest,5
teacher:On the left side or the right side,5
teacher:What do each of those fractions represent;student:No,5
teacher:What do each of those data points in your table represent,5
teacher:What does it represent,5
teacher:Good the amount that that particularShas grown over the past;student:The growth of the,5
teacher:How much didSone grow in the first year Mackenzie,5
teacher:One and a half chickens;student:One and a half,5
teacher:What unit are we measuring this is in,5
teacher:One and a half,5
teacher:Student one grew one and a half inches over the past year but if we go down toSone two three four how much did they grow,5
teacher:How much did they grow Leo,5
teacher:Silas looking at that data what is the largest any oneShas grown over the past year,5
teacher:What is the single most anySin that class has grown this past year Landon,5
teacher:How do you know that,5
teacher:What I mean by unique how many different numbers are there,5
teacher:So many of you said that thats the answer but how,5
teacher:Well what should it be,5
teacher:If I would have done the whole class how many Xs would I have,5
teacher:Looking at the data that it is raw data whats the benefit of colorcoding it,5
teacher:Whats the benefit of using these colors,5
teacher:How many seven and 34 are there,5
teacher:Okay but yet how many eighths are there;student:Three,5
teacher:Now when I taught the five of you in the back of the room the other day one of the things that I stressed was you take your data and you arrange it from,5
teacher:So what are we going to do from here,5
teacher:What could the title be,5
teacher:What could be a decent title for this,5
teacher:I do like theSgrowth piece but what should we add to help define our dataset a little bit more,5
teacher:What happened to our piece of data that says one half;student:Yes,5
teacher:What numbers do you need to put on your line plot to represent the data that youre using,5
teacher:What numbers should represent your lines on your line plot,5
teacher:What does the label mean;student:How much do we,5
teacher:Who can tell me what the first label should be on your line plot,5
teacher:How do you know that;student:Yes,5
teacher:Diego how many,5
teacher:How many,5
teacher:How many spaces are there on your line plot for you to fill in,5
teacher:Youre right but what do you mean by easier,5
teacher:What do the horns do in partial products,5
teacher:what do my horns do,5
teacher:Then when we multiply what are we actually multiplying by,5
teacher:Were multiplying singledigit numbers with what at the end of them,5
teacher:Those are called,5
teacher:Whats the answer,5
teacher:Whats seven times five,5
teacher:What is that number called,5
teacher:135 what is that number in the division problem called,5
teacher:whats it called,5
teacher:So what does the dividend stand for,5
teacher:Meaning what is this number,5
teacher:What does it tell us,5
teacher:What does this tell us Cameron,5
teacher:What do you mean by easier;student:So that it could be easier,5
teacher:What did we do to solve a partial products problem,5
teacher:What was that whole algorithm,5
teacher:When I taught you the math monster what did partial products mean to you,5
teacher:But we only have,5
teacher:What number would that be,5
teacher:What should your title be down here on the bottom where it says The label for your horizontal axis,5
teacher:What should that label be,5
teacher:What do those numbers on that line plot represent,5
teacher:What is it measured in,5
teacher:Its measured in,5
teacher:Wed only have,5
teacher:What do those two words mean,5
teacher:What does partial mean,5
teacher:what does partial mean,5
teacher:So what do you think partial quotient is going to be,5
teacher:What do you think is going to be,5
teacher:give me the definition of partial products,5
teacher:What does partial products mean to you when we did partial products,5
teacher:What is partial products,5
teacher:What does partial mean,5
teacher:How many have six;student:One,5
teacher:How many have five;student:One,5
teacher:How many have four;student:Amy,5
teacher:What does our denominator Marie tell us in this problem;student:A whole,5
teacher:Five marbles equals what,5
teacher:Were going to split the what,5
teacher:What would I do now Mr Gale,5
teacher:What would I do as a Mr Parker,5
teacher:Just think about this when I teach what do I do 90 of the time,5
teacher:Mr Gale what question do you think I would ask right now,5
teacher:How much;student:How much circles are these,5
teacher:Ms  What do those wholes actually represent;student:There are seven wholes,5
teacher:Seven whole what,5
teacher:What questions should you be asking,5
teacher:What questions should our Mr Parker be asking the class right now,5
teacher:The question was how did we get the 35;student:How do we get that answer,5
teacher:Guys the denominator tells us what;student:Yes,5
teacher:What method is this,5
teacher:So Brian what does our denominator tell us in this problem;student:Because thats how many are going to fit in one bag,5
teacher:How many go in each one,5
teacher:Could you clarify what you mean Mr Jack,5
teacher:What would you do now,5
teacher:Good but which improper fraction do they want us to convert;student:Wants to convert improper fractions to mixed numbers,5
teacher:What do you think I would talk about first off,5
teacher:Before I would talk about any of that what would I start with;student:You will talk about how do you convert them to a mixed number,5
teacher:What have I made the biggest deal about lately when dealing with fractions in general,5
teacher:When I taught yesterday what did I use as my wholes,5
teacher:Who can tell our Mr Parker what I used as wholes yesterday;student:No,5
teacher:Who can tell our Mr Parker what I used as wholes yesterday;student:Candy bars,5
teacher:What would we call this method,5
teacher:Whether I was talking about candies or marbles what was my whole,5
teacher:What are we trying to find out in this problem Angela,5
teacher:If that improper fraction represented our marbles and how many marbles and how many marbles went in each bag what would our answer tell us,5
teacher:How would I go about solving this using the class,5
teacher:What would that picture look like,5
teacher:What would I say,5
teacher:What do we do next,5
teacher:What would you do now Jake;student:Jake,5
teacher:Which was;student:Six,5
teacher:If this was marbles what would that be,5
teacher:Whats the benefit of doing multiple methods with anything,5
teacher:What happens if we dont,5
teacher:You do that by putting a,5
teacher:What could we put,5
teacher:What do you think we could write as a good title that if I took this information to Mrs McCain shed understand what it means,5
teacher:What do those numbers represent,5
teacher:What does it represent Henry,5
teacher:What did we label,5
teacher:What axis are we working on Diego,5
teacher:What axis are we working on,5
teacher:The way were going to illustrate our numbers in a line plot is with,5
teacher:Mr Silas how manySSat Table 1 had zero pets,5
teacher:So how many smiley faces am I going to put above my zero huh,5
teacher:Faith how manySShave one pet,5
teacher:Do we know which one it stands for,5
teacher:How many have two,5
teacher:How many have three,5
teacher:What information do I now know Josie,5
teacher:Angel whats data,5
teacher:What is data,5
teacher:When I say data what do I mean,5
teacher:Now if you do multiple methods and you get the same answer what does that pretty much tell you,5
teacher:Well what should we start with,5
teacher:What number can we multiply 5 by to give us an answer close to 38 but you cant have to go over,5
teacher:What would give us our answer that is close but less than,5
teacher:Very good and Ms Michelle what is 5x7;student:5x7,5
teacher:Then when we subtract Ryan what are we left with,5
teacher:Every time we take away five of our marbles that equals one more of what,5
teacher:Multiplication addition subtraction anything what is the benefit of doing multiple methods,5
teacher:How many sacks would that be,5
teacher:If I had two bags of marbles how many marbles do I have,5
teacher:It has numbers and what,5
teacher:Isaiah said it has lines and Isaiah is actually correct because a line plot starts with,5
teacher:How do you know its a line,5
teacher:How do you know thats a line,5
teacher:Jonah how do we know,5
teacher:How do we know that that is a line and not a line segment or not a Bailey,5
teacher:What do these three represent,5
teacher:Brian what is the first question wanting us to do,5
teacher:Total,5
teacher:What does the divisor tell us,5
teacher:Ms Emily how many am I left with in my big giant container,5
teacher:Whats 403,5
teacher:This is our answer and our remainder is;student:43,5
teacher:Out of;student:One,5
teacher:What do we do from here,5
teacher:What is the last step of partial quotients,5
teacher:Where would I go from here,5
teacher:How would I turn this into exponential form,5
teacher:How do I rewrite that using exponential form Charlie,5
teacher:32 x 5 Who can take this one down for me;student:You divide,5
teacher:What one is not prime Clay,5
teacher:Which one is not prime;student:What,5
teacher:Try writing down talk to a neighbor if you need some help how would I turn that into exponential form,5
teacher:What is that 72 in exponential form,5
teacher:Now really what I asked you to do was using this how would we find the greatest common factor,5
teacher:This time Im going to take my divisor 5 and what should I multiply it by to get me a number of less than 16 but close to it,5
teacher:Someone new what is the strategy for finding the greatest common factor using prime factorization Laura,5
teacher:What are you going multiply five there champ,5
teacher:What did I suggest you should start with here,5
teacher:Whats six times two,5
teacher:Six times 20 is,5
teacher:Whats six times three,5
teacher:Class whats six times three,5
teacher:Add a zero;student:18,5
teacher:Okay so what do I know right now;student:180,5
teacher:Ava what do I know right now,5
teacher:With this one what do I know,5
teacher:What is six times one;student:Yes,5
teacher:Which one of these is better,5
teacher:Which one of these two is better,5
teacher:We want two bags how many marbles are we putting in,5
teacher:Right and how did you do that;student:12,5
teacher:We dont care about those three extra marbles but if it said how many bags would we need to put all of the marbles in what would my answer be,5
teacher:the first number where;student:is always,5
teacher:You can start there but if youre not good at your multiplication facts what should you start with,5
teacher:Awesome whatd you do;student:Yes,5
teacher:What do I do to find the least common multiple using prime factorization,5
teacher:Whats the next step that we do,5
teacher:Do you have something in mind,5
teacher:Then how many cans,5
teacher:What really do you need here,5
teacher:If this is 16 then how many pieces are we breaking this whole,5
teacher:How many pieces,5
teacher:When were breaking up this into six pieces what do we do with it,5
teacher:How are we all doing,5
teacher:No no you just have to do Here you would want to think What could I divide these by thats a factor of both of them,5
teacher:What  might go into both of those,5
teacher:What number goes into every even number,5
teacher:What number is a factor of every even number,5
teacher:Whats 26 divided by 2,5
teacher:Theres 240 total and they made 200 out of 240 so what fraction is that,5
teacher:So far the big idea of this whole book has been finding parts of wholes so if theres one thing to get in your mind by the final for next Tuesday its how do I find parts of wholes,5
teacher:How do I find them using fractions,5
teacher:How much have they fundraised,5
teacher:Just like we broke 600 into 6 and 240 is broken up into how many pieces,5
teacher:360 is broken up into how many pieces,5
teacher:Then when youre at 1 and 3 how can you get to 15,5
teacher:Where did I put this,5
teacher:Nicole do you want to go through the next one,5
teacher:Whats 12   6,5
teacher:Okay now so just like here what do they do from here to here;student:What do I do,5
teacher:This is the third graders goal so you guys whats the Mrs Reevess goal,5
teacher:You have to look at your paper Adler what does it say right here,5
teacher:Whats the Mrs Reevess goal,5
teacher:Now some of you most of you hopefully realize at this point that this is the same thing as;student:12,5
teacher:How did you get 34,5
teacher:How many of these do you feel might be in the rest of that right there,5
teacher:More,5
teacher:What fraction would that be then;student:Yes,5
teacher:Whats 70;student:Whats 72   2,5
teacher:Whats happening between 30 and 40,5
teacher:When were breaking the total into six pieces what operation do we do then,5
teacher:How would we calculate that,5
teacher:How would you break up this one,5
teacher:Three but how many marbles do we need in order to make a full bag;student:Three,5
teacher:How many marbles do we have leftover,5
teacher:10 plus 10 plus two is,5
teacher:Oh that was terrible,5
teacher:Why cant I just do that,5
teacher:Whats the problem,5
teacher:Explain it using the marble problem,5
teacher:What does that mean;student:Because its bigger than the dividend,5
teacher:The question now Im going to ask is a very simple one what do you think we should start within our thinking box,5
teacher:As a team I want you to come up with what number we should start with,5
teacher:Six times what,5
teacher:Table one what do you think we should start with,5
teacher:Okay so what goes on the outside of my box;student:60,5
teacher:What goes on the outside of the box over here,5
teacher:What am I multiplying times 6,5
teacher:6 times 10 equals,5
teacher:What does the 60 tell us in the marble problem,5
teacher:How many bags was I able to make,5
teacher:Thats what Im going to do,5
teacher:Whats the problem with saying Okay Im just going to multiply 6 times 100 and that gives me 600,5
teacher:Whats the problem with going over,5
teacher:It is we need to figure out how many times six goes into our total as close to it as we can get without going,5
teacher:What is one of the two things the divisor can tell us,5
teacher:Can anybody tell me what the second possibility is that our divisor can be,5
teacher:It can be the number per group or it can be,5
teacher:If our problem was this is my total marbles this is my marbles per bag what would my quotient be,5
teacher:If the six tells us the number of groups then this tells us,5
teacher:My question would be how many bags do I need,5
teacher:How many groups,5
teacher:Ive taken out 60 marbles so far so when I subtract what does that number tell me,5
teacher:How many marbles are in each group,5
teacher:As a table I want you to talk and decide what should go in your thinking box,5
teacher:What should go in our thinking box,5
teacher:Thats when you  but the problem is how many times does six go into five,5
teacher:Jack how do we determine what were going to multiply by what in partial products,5
teacher:When we do partial products when I taught you partial products for an entire month how did we determine what was going to be multiplied by what,5
teacher:In partial products how do we determine what gets multiplied by what,5
teacher:Delilah how do we know,5
teacher:What we have to ask ourselves is this what should go in our thinking box,5
teacher:Outside the house outside the box what is this guy called,5
teacher:Before I even get the number what is it going to tell me,5
teacher:What does that number 75 tell me,5
teacher:Weve got to start filling up more bags so what do we do,5
teacher:Now what do we do,5
teacher:When we subtract were trying to figure out,5
teacher:What do we do now,5
teacher:Now we go back to our,5
teacher:What number can we multiply times 6 that will get us close to 15 without going over;student:Thinking box,5
teacher:Six times two which is;student:Two,5
teacher:Whats six times three,5
teacher:What do you mean no;student:No,5
teacher:What goes on the outside,5
teacher:Class what goes on the outside,5
teacher:What goes on the inside,5
teacher:What are we left with,5
teacher:How many marbles are left in our giant bucket now,5
teacher:15 takeaway 12,5
teacher:We try to start filling up more bags because we know we still have how many marbles left to go Lydia,5
teacher:Leon whats the area of the yellow triangle,5
teacher:What do we do now,5
teacher:What do we do now,5
teacher:Table five what does it tell me,5
teacher:Ms  what does it tell me,5
teacher:That are still;student:How many marbles are left,5
teacher:How did I get that 75,5
teacher:How did I get seven there,5
teacher:How did I get seven,5
teacher:It is what I was trying to do but whats wrong;student:No,5
teacher:What does that number going to tell me when I take that out,5
teacher:What do I still have Roman,5
teacher:Zach what are we trying to do in this problem,5
teacher:What are we trying to do in this problem;student:Trying to,5
teacher:Oh my goodness what is the whole goal of this problem,5
teacher:What are we trying to accomplish,5
teacher:Lynn what are we trying to accomplish;student:Were trying to accomplish how many bags,5
teacher:What are we trying to figure out here Lacy,5
teacher:No because they dont fill another bag and the question says how many full bags of marbles will we make;student:No,5
teacher:said we know that our number needs to be less than six whats left in our giant bucket needs to be less than six and the reason is what Mr Jonah said because what are we trying to do in this problem,5
teacher:Do we all know what collaboratively means,5
teacher:Can any teams come up with a oneword answer to what they have in common,5
teacher:What do those three shapes have in common,5
teacher:What stuff do they turn into fertilizer,5
teacher:Does anybody know just what it is that earthworms redworms use to create fertilizer,5
teacher:Trash and;student:Trash,5
teacher:Animals that are in nature where do they go to the bathroom,5
teacher:We are going to be decomposing,5
teacher:How can we break something down when it comes to fractions,5
teacher:Okay what about a whole;student:Breakdown,5
teacher:How can we break a whole down,5
teacher:How could I break this down fractionally,5
teacher:Okay so how would I do that,5
teacher:But essentially what have I done,5
teacher:Ive decomposed one Kleenex into;student:You discomposed it,5
teacher:What did I actually do,5
teacher:Finn what did I actually do,5
teacher:right down the middle,5
teacher:Jessica what do you think,5
teacher:What did I actually do,5
teacher:Does anybody know what it means for an earthworm to be a decomposer,5
teacher:Parts of,5
teacher:Whatever you do to the bottom;student:Nine,5
teacher:If we want to get from nine to 36 what must we multiply it by,5
teacher:Whatever we do to the bottom we must do to the top so what is my new numerator;student:Whatever we do to the bottom,5
teacher:Which ones bigger,5
teacher:What do we get when we multiply these together,5
teacher:Whatever you do to the bottom,5
teacher:Whats two times nine,5
teacher:Whatever we do to the bottom;student:Yes,5
teacher:Tell me whats nine time one;student:We must do to the top,5
teacher:Eight times two,5
teacher:Whats bigger sixteen eighteenths or nine eighteenths;student:8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16,5
teacher:Jessica which of these two words are you familiar with,5
teacher:What do fractions mean to you,5
teacher:Anybody else have another one,5
teacher:Anybody have a word other than set that we could use,5
teacher:Okay Adam what do you think;student:I have heard of it but I dont know what it means,5
teacher:I broke it apart as Dominic said but what did I break it apart into,5
teacher:Whats different between the one that I cut and the one I didnt,5
teacher:Whats different between these,5
teacher:What other evidence do we need to know as to who is right Dominic,5
teacher:What do you mean by each piece explain;student:You opened each piece into different things things,5
teacher:How is that possible,5
teacher:Because you all thought when I cut it in half that there were how many pieces,5
teacher:The one missing component that youre missing from this to determine who is correct is what do we know about this;student:Two,5
teacher:So what changed,5
teacher:Mathematically what changed,5
teacher:What changed Lola,5
teacher:I didnt actually start with one whole I started with two holes but under the pretense of even though these are two separate pieces when they were together did we view them as separate pieces or as one whole,5
teacher:This one whole even though I didnt cut it when I separate it how many pieces that I actually make;student:One whole,5
teacher:Because if I would have separated them first like so what would I need to do to those two to make them look like these Rosalie,5
teacher:Really how many cuts did I make,5
teacher:What I did was I cut at one time it looked like two pieces of paper but when I pulled them apart how many did I actually have,5
teacher:What color shape matches the shape that you have on your piece of paper,5
teacher:What color,5
teacher:How many,5
teacher:What do you have to know Laurel,5
teacher:Think what do you have to know in order to tell whether Adam is right or Sadie is right,5
teacher:What do we need to understand,5
teacher:When you look at these whats different,5
teacher:Which ones bigger;student:No,5
teacher:What are these pieces;student:No,5
teacher:As we know from our work with fractions in the last unit two halves put together makes,5
teacher:Its actually how much,5
teacher:What is this,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:If we want to get 36 as our denominator Mr Dylan what do I multiply four by to get to 36,5
teacher:What do you guys think;student:Can we say open it up,5
teacher:What do you guys think,5
teacher:I was just talking to that group they thought that too but the problem with that is to make 14 of something how many cuts do you need to have;student:I think it is 14,5
teacher:What do you guys think,5
teacher:Mr Adam you think its what,5
teacher:What is your math thinking around this concept,5
teacher:To understand which one of these two is right we need to understand what,5
teacher:What do we really need to understand about my question,5
teacher:To make 14 how many cuts do I normally need,5
teacher:If we take nine and four what common denominator choices do we have,5
teacher:Mr Asher which one is larger,5
teacher:Number one which one is larger,5
teacher:Not the same thing but it is;student:No,5
teacher:What is my trapezoid worth,5
teacher:How much of my whole is it worth;student:Three,5
teacher:Whats the right answer,5
teacher:What was our initial shape,5
teacher:How much is it worth,5
teacher:How many days does it take to make a hole Dylan;student:One,5
teacher:How many do we have;student:Four,5
teacher:Our trapezoid is worth one fourth and how much was our triangle worth;student:One,5
teacher:How are you telling me that those are equal to those,5
teacher:So what must we do first,5
teacher:How do we find a common denominator for this,5
teacher:Alex how do we find a common denominator for that,5
teacher:Good so whatll my numerator be;student:Because if you cut the pizza more youre changing the number of slices that you care about,5
teacher:Ladies and gentlemen what will my actual answer be;student:Three,5
teacher:Josh what does it give us;student:Four sixth,5
teacher:What does that give us,5
teacher:One third plus one third equals,5
teacher:What is the blue one worth,5
teacher:Now whatever we do to the top,5
teacher:Times four,5
teacher:So if we have them equal if we want to make four our denominator what do we multiply two by,5
teacher:Whatever we do to the bottom,5
teacher:And whats our numerator going to be,5
teacher:You want to make this into four what do we multiply this by,5
teacher:Whatever we do to the bottom,5
teacher:But now we have a problem is four twelves equal to those other ones;student:And the answer is,5
teacher:So what do we get;student:We must do to the top,5
teacher:How many rhombuses does it take to make onehole hexagon,5
teacher:If we want one out of those what would my fraction be,5
teacher:Miss Isla what did you pick,5
teacher:Well do you know the answer;student:Im number two,5
teacher:Miss Lauren how did you determine what the answer was,5
teacher:How would we write the blue ones,5
teacher:What would it look like,5
teacher:And now they are,5
teacher:Now some of you got it and some of you didnt but what I want to know is where did you start,5
teacher:Anybody figure out which ones wrong,5
teacher:You guys all said that this was one sixth yes you did it its right there but what did we establish how many of these did we need to fill the entire shape,5
teacher:Alex whats the problem,5
teacher:What is the largest denominator we could possibly make with the shapes we have,5
teacher:What is that giving us,5
teacher:But youre comparing which ones bigger;student:You still need one more triangle,5
teacher:Which one;student:I know which is bigger,5
teacher:Which one did you say is bigger,5
teacher:Can anybody prove that two thirds is bigger,5
teacher:So Miss Isla how do we find a common denominator,5
teacher:Can anybody tell me the shortcut way,5
teacher:How,5
teacher:Whatever we,5
teacher:Hey Isla which ones bigger;student:We got confused because everybody else was,5
teacher:Look up here which ones bigger,5
teacher:This one or this thing,5
teacher:This one or this one,5
teacher:Which of those pieces would break that into three equal pieces,5
teacher:What shape would break it into three pieces,5
teacher:We added,5
teacher:What did we do with the math,5
teacher:We needed 12 so each one of those shouldnt have been one sixth what should it have been,5
teacher:What does the board say is equal to one,5
teacher:But what is the problem that were trying to solve say what was one whole,5
teacher:Two hexagons so heres what I want to see if youre smart enough to figure it out one third is not right for our rhombuses what would the right fraction be if this was our whole;student:Two hexagons,5
teacher:David since youre so diligently focusing on the problem at hand what would my rhombuses be worth because clearly one third does not work because this is not our whole,5
teacher:Mr David how many rhombuses do you need to fill them all,5
teacher:If you take one of them out of there whats your fraction;student:Six,5
teacher:Whats wrong with this;student:No,5
teacher:One out of how many did you need;student:Five,5
teacher:Whats your answer,5
teacher:Two sixth which one is bigger,5
teacher:Which one is bigger,5
teacher:How were you supposed to do that,5
teacher:Watch how do we find a common denominator,5
teacher:Whats wrong here folks,5
teacher:This could have also been the right answer but its not right the way we wrote it because what did we do,5
teacher:Which one is greater,5
teacher:Think for a minute what was the first thing you had to do,5
teacher:What was the first thing you had to do,5
teacher:How did you know what the right one is;student:Had to find the right one,5
teacher:What was your answer in fraction form,5
teacher:In fraction form what did it look like,5
teacher:What fraction did you make by adding onehalf plus onehalf,5
teacher:What fraction would you get by adding one half plus one half,5
teacher:Walker if you know tell us;student:I know,5
teacher:Because what does the numerator tell us;student:So the denominator is how many pieces that you need to make one whole and if the denominator is two and the numerator is two so you have enough to make one whole,5
teacher:Twohalves one well its because of what they just said your denominator tells us what Chance,5
teacher:What does the denominator tell us,5
teacher:So when we were dealing with our halves if this is a whole Erics what shape do I need two of,5
teacher:Two what;student:Two,5
teacher:So in my fraction 1212 if I put them together that equals,5
teacher:For the second one what shape are we talking about for number two,5
teacher:How many triangles Tanner do we need to make one whole,5
teacher:So if I have 6 triangles whats my numerator;student:6,5
teacher:How many triangles do I need to make one whole again;student:Two,5
teacher:Miss Addie what did you come up with our first number sentence,5
teacher:Mr Charles please tell me what it is,5
teacher:Can you please show me threesixth plus threesixth,5
teacher:Please show me what that number sentence looks like,5
teacher:What do you think about it,5
teacher:What do you think Eric and Melissa,5
teacher:How can you create a number sentence using the other pieces,5
teacher:Chance what do you think,5
teacher:What is that trapezoid,5
teacher:One half of a donkey;student:Onehalf,5
teacher:Of a whole what;student:Onehalf of a whole,5
teacher:So I have six out of;student:Six,5
teacher:Now because we are also smart in order to make this a true number sentence and using the shape that goes along with that one what would I have to put with that red trapezoid,5
teacher:Explain your thinking Diana,5
teacher:Could you please talk to your team about youre doingReally Knox what did he just do,5
teacher:Mr Tanner can you give me one of your other two number sentences youve created;student:We all have a good,5
teacher:Can you show me what that looks like,5
teacher:Mr Chance please tell me one of the number sentences your team came up with,5
teacher:How many onesixths did you have Mr Chance;student:When you put onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth,5
teacher:Mr Chance only can you please show me what that would look like with shapes;student:Six,5
teacher:What would I have to put with that red trapezoid to make one whole Diana,5
teacher:What have I written on the board,5
teacher:What about rhombuses how many rhombuses do I need to make one whole,5
teacher:Eric do you know what it is,5
teacher:How did you go from two to six,5
teacher:so talk to the classmates tell me what to do,5
teacher:Okay then;student:So you multiply two times three because it equals six,5
teacher:All right what about the next one Leia,5
teacher:What is your final answer,5
teacher:What is your final answer,5
teacher:What did you get;student:I got,5
teacher:What does work,5
teacher:What can we turn our denominator into;student:is,5
teacher:What denominator does work,5
teacher:What do all three of those shapes have in common,5
teacher:What do they have in common,5
teacher:What do those all have in common,5
teacher:What do they all have in common;student:We can all cover,5
teacher:What do those two shapes have in common,5
teacher:How did you get six as a denominator,5
teacher:Then when we break a half into six pieces how many pieces do we actually have;student:Oh,5
teacher:How did we get threesixths out of one half,5
teacher:What shape can we use to make those all look the same,5
teacher:Lets see it;student:Yes,5
teacher:So Leila please explain to me visually what shapes you used to make your whole,5
teacher:What are the other ones called;student:This triangle plus one rhombus,5
teacher:How many of you can tell me fractionally what that looks like;student:Yes,5
teacher:What your number sentence actually looked like with fractions,5
teacher:table what did I do wrong;student:What,5
teacher:One two who can tell me what I did wrong;student:You should,5
teacher:Aiden how many rhombuses do I need to make one whole,5
teacher:what did I do wrong,5
teacher:So my answer should be,5
teacher:So what do you have to do,5
teacher:Now using this one how can you show me a common denominator,5
teacher:Now can you show me using actual fractions,5
teacher:Now can you show me in fractional form how that looks,5
teacher:Now can you do it fractions,5
teacher:So now that weve done this how would that look in fraction form,5
teacher:Yes multiply what,5
teacher:How do I find them using percents,5
teacher:What is a number sentence,5
teacher:What is my predicate,5
teacher:Now what do you have,5
teacher:Leslie what is it you see,5
teacher:Derek is that what you see,5
teacher:Mr Griffin you have your hand up now you didnt see twofourths what did you see,5
teacher:Somebody who did what they actually Lets see something else Easton what do you see,5
teacher:What does that mean;student:But its also twofourths,5
teacher:Is it twofourths or is it onehalf,5
teacher:Ah explain that what do you mean by that;student:Theyre equivalent,5
teacher:I love the word equivalent so lets focus on it but what does it mean;student:I said they are both half of,5
teacher:When you say that Hope what do you mean,5
teacher:What do you see in front of you do you see onehalf or do you see twofourths;student:That they  the same amount,5
teacher:Keep going theres two what;student:Theres two,5
teacher:Show me what onehalf would look like,5
teacher:If I ordered a pizza and I had this much left and it looked just like this and I wanted to eat this Easton what would I be eating,5
teacher:If that remaining pizza was cut into two pieces that looked like this what would I be eating Hope,5
teacher:You have one out of;student:Four,5
teacher:How many of these did we need to fill the whole thing up,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:If you have one yellow piece in your circle Ben what do you have,5
teacher:What do you mean;student:I had to attempt to put them in circles,5
teacher:And what happened;student:Originally I first started looking for the green ones,5
teacher:How do you know;student:Grabbed three of them and they did not make threefourths,5
teacher:I want to hear from somebody how did you approach this,5
teacher:Whats the first thing you tried to do Selena,5
teacher:What do you mean;student:I looked for my fourths,5
teacher:Thats kind of cheating but think of what you just said in regards to your whole what do you have to do,5
teacher:What if I only ate this guy;student:Twofourths,5
teacher:How;student:Yes,5
teacher:How did you know,5
teacher:Derek how did you know,5
teacher:Of our fraction which one of the two things are you actually looking for,5
teacher:Of our fraction which of the two pieces are you actually looking for the numerator or the denominator,5
teacher:You need to identify which of these pieces does it take four of to make one circle then once you put all four of those yellow ones on you simply take one off and what is left,5
teacher:Miss Tessa please come to the board and show us your answer,5
teacher:Miss Jessica when you look at what you just put on your paper what do you see,5
teacher:How did you know the yellow ones were the ones we were looking for,5
teacher:So what am I missing Mr Tanner,5
teacher:And then if I eat this guy;student:Onefourth,5
teacher:In order to get this what would it look like mathematically,5
teacher:Lucy whats a number sentence,5
teacher:A number sentence,5
teacher:A number sentence,5
teacher:Who else has an idea of what a number sentence is,5
teacher:Miss Nina what is a number sentence to you,5
teacher:Number Sentence,5
teacher:What makes it a sentence,5
teacher:What do we need to make a sentence a sentence,5
teacher:Mr Charles what do we need,5
teacher:And;student:Some type of punctuation to end it and a beginning,5
teacher:What goes along with a subject,5
teacher:What is my subject,5
teacher:What is my subject in my sentence,5
teacher:Which one is it;student:Dog or I,5
teacher:I or dog,5
teacher:What is a number sentence,5
teacher:Well heres one group heres two groups heres three groups and when we put them together we get,5
teacher:By multiplying by three were essentially saying we want three groups of;student:Addition,5
teacher:Repeated,5
teacher:Lets start with this one everybody show me mathematically what does this look like,5
teacher:Equals,5
teacher:Show me what it would look like in a number sentence form so this is the answer thats a correct answer but what does it look like individually;student:36,5
teacher:First what you needed to ask yourself was how many parts do we need to make a whole,5
teacher:Finn how many did we need,5
teacher:How many of those blue ones did we need to make a whole circle,5
teacher:To make a whole circle,5
teacher:How many of these does it take to make a whole,5
teacher:Six becomes our,5
teacher:How many of those blue shapes do you see Ishmael,5
teacher:What is that one worth,5
teacher:How many of those did you say we had,5
teacher:If I did 16 plus 16 plus 16 what would that be equal to,5
teacher:Class what would it be equal to,5
teacher:Which we also know because were superintelligent people is equal to;student:36,5
teacher:What did we say early on in the year that multiplication was,5
teacher:Now when you look visually down at your paper with those three blue shapes what do you actually see,5
teacher:Whats the area of pink square,5
teacher:How is it related to subtraT2ion Michael;student:Do we have a pen,5
teacher:Sarah what Im I going to put here,5
teacher:And also,5
teacher:The fact that were making a quadrilateral into a triangle means what happens to the number of angles,5
teacher:The number of angles goes from four to,5
teacher:How will it be I wonder,5
teacher:And also;student:Its okay,5
teacher:And the fact that were making a quadrilateral into a triangle means that we do what to one angle,5
teacher:When it moves to where would it disappear,5
teacher:Where is it,5
teacher:If it becomes like this then this angle,5
teacher:Then how many triangles are there that are the same as this triangle,5
teacher:The fact that were making a quadrilateral into a triangle means,5
teacher:How many methods have you found;student:Two,5
teacher:For example if you do it like this how is it,5
teacher:Then if you make this straight over here then what kind of triangle will it be,5
teacher:How many methods did you get,5
teacher:That means that to reduce angles you take one,5
teacher:How many methods did you get,5
teacher:The fact is were making a triangle a quadrangle into a triangle you do what to one angle;student:Triangle,5
teacher:What kind of shape will it become,5
teacher:Then Ikeda will you do it;student:What are you saying,5
teacher:Will you do it in the two ways for us;student:I dont know,5
teacher:Can you explain it;student:Huh,5
teacher:When you have drawn it like this of the area over here and the area over here which seems to be bi bigger,5
teacher:If its between over here and over here which seems to be smaller,5
teacher:How is that;student:The base is the same,5
teacher:This and this are the same and this and this are the same ahh which is it,5
teacher:If it becomes wha what sided shape can you do the problem,5
teacher:If it becomes what sided shape can you do the problem,5
teacher:What do we need to do to change this into that,5
teacher:How can we do it,5
teacher:When you look at it like this then there is a triangle and how can we change it may I ask,5
teacher:What did we have to do to make a triangle that has the same area as this triangle may I ask,5
teacher:I wonder how many can you make;student:How many do I make,5
teacher:I wonder how many ways it can be made;student:Am I supposed to draw all of them,5
teacher:For example if the corner here becomes straight with this here and here then this is,5
teacher:How many did you get Ryu,5
teacher:Cant you make one on th this side,5
teacher:How about it,5
teacher:How many days has it been since they started praying,5
teacher:How much is in this in the beginning,5
teacher:How much is in it,5
teacher:There are only fiveyen coins in it but how much is in it,5
teacher:Okay then how about it at this stage,5
teacher:Which one has more in terms of the amount of money,5
teacher:How about it in this stage,5
teacher:Now that one day was how many days um since they started their praying,5
teacher:Then on the third day who has more,5
teacher:Then how about the fourth day,5
teacher:If you keep on doing it like that,5
teacher:Then how about the third day,5
teacher:How about it,5
teacher:In the same manner try thinking like how about the fourth day,5
teacher:Then on the third day who had more,5
teacher:Next what do you want to do,5
teacher:Which one is it,5
teacher:And also the ones where we drew a line through B D and we drew a parallel line on the C side are this and which one is it,5
teacher:Then in the same way um which one is it,5
teacher:How many methods did you get,5
teacher:Which is it,5
teacher:Are there others Taniguchi,5
teacher:Then okay,5
teacher:Which ones did you get,5
teacher:How many did you get;student:Eight,5
teacher:How many did you get;student:Huh,5
teacher:Make it into a straight line;student:Thats right,5
teacher:How many;student:Huh,5
teacher:Which side;student:No,5
teacher:Then if you get one on this side then,5
teacher:How many types did you f notice,5
teacher:Also what else;student:Lately Ive worked really hard for my life,5
teacher:What is this,5
teacher:This,5
teacher:What is that over there;student:Why,5
teacher:How did you get one,5
teacher:And for example in what kind what situations does this become a straight line;student:Yes,5
teacher:The area thats the same as this triangle;student:Tri,5
teacher:Which one is the same area as this triangle;student:Yes,5
teacher:In fact if you want to find expanded form what are you doing,5
teacher:What will be the expanded form for the righthand side,5
teacher:It will be;student:Two X,5
teacher:All right then how to prove identity,5
teacher:It should be,5
teacher:Minus three X and;student:Minus three X,5
teacher:Therefore how many X,5
teacher:And the constant term,5
teacher:Therefore do you think that it is an identity,5
teacher:Or an equation,5
teacher:Okay how about the second one,5
teacher:How is it,5
teacher:Okay what did you do;student:Yes,5
teacher:Change the middle means,5
teacher:How many times is this bent,5
teacher:Expanded form or factorized form,5
teacher:Which form is more easy for you,5
teacher:Therefore this is called,5
teacher:Of course we will we will not call them terms we should call him call them,5
teacher:Two plus five,5
teacher:It is,5
teacher:How about three,5
teacher:But for the righthand side,5
teacher:How many,5
teacher:Errors,5
teacher:Tell me the result when X equals zero what will be the lefthand side and righthand side,5
teacher:Where do you solve for this;student:If you have finished,5
teacher:Lefthand side,5
teacher:Okay how about the fourth trial when X equals negative one,5
teacher:How about the fifth trial,5
teacher:How many solutions now,5
teacher:It is called,5
teacher:It is called,5
teacher:How do we call them,5
teacher:Add or minus together it is called,5
teacher:How about the righthand side,5
teacher:How much will it be,5
teacher:Where do you solve for this problem;student:Hum,5
teacher:What does that mean for A,5
teacher:Draw a line somewhere and make a triangle;student:Huh,5
teacher:Then where would you draw a parallel line,5
teacher:If you were to make a triangle somewhere if you draw a line where would you get a triangle;student:You talk too much you stupid,5
teacher:Where,5
teacher:Then where is the same area as this triangle,5
teacher:If you were to draw a line parallel to th this triangle where would you draw it,5
teacher:Then where would you get a triangle that is the same area as this triangle,5
teacher:Then to make this nicely into one line somewhere where should we move this;student:I have no clue what he is saying,5
teacher:What should we do;student:Ah,5
teacher:Then since here it is parallel so where is the area that is the same as this triangle,5
teacher:Then for this to neatly become straight where does the triangle form,5
teacher:Or,5
teacher:How did you do it,5
teacher:Try explaining it,5
teacher:Would you do the one you were showing just now up at the front;student:Yes,5
teacher:Make a triangle somewhere,5
teacher:Then if you do what,5
teacher:Is there a method that uses the area of the triangles,5
teacher:A method that uses the same method as last time,5
teacher:Where;student:Add this like this,5
teacher:Where;student:If you extend it its 60 degrees,5
teacher:How many bends are there,5
teacher:Which one;student:This one this one,5
teacher:What shall I do,5
teacher:Can you solve this;student:Huh,5
teacher:Um do you remember what we did last period,5
teacher:Then what is this,5
teacher:Sakurai what kind of things did we do;student:We did mathematics,5
teacher:Around where would you like;student:More,5
teacher:Then around where would it be good,5
teacher:Around where do you think would it be good,5
teacher:Well try doing it;student:That line well,5
teacher:Approximately;student:Huh,5
teacher:Estimate,5
teacher:What was the thing we studied last time,5
teacher:Around where would you like it;student:No,5
teacher:Two X plus five,5
teacher:Well if its the third day where is how much,5
teacher:How did you obtain this,5
teacher:If you buy seven if you buy seven 200yen ones how much does it become,5
teacher:How much is it if you add it,5
teacher:Two thousand;student:Two thousand and seventy yen,5
teacher:What about yours Joji,5
teacher:What about yours Arai,5
teacher:Whats yours Kamon,5
teacher:How do you work it out,5
teacher:What did you set up,5
teacher:How did you do it,5
teacher:Your method,5
teacher:Okay what about Luikos,5
teacher:Then what about other people,5
teacher:How did you do yours Bancho,5
teacher:How did you do that,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:When you buy seven;student:Seven,5
teacher:Then how much money is needed,5
teacher:And what about this side,5
teacher:Then Ikui where did you find an answer that was exactly even,5
teacher:And so you want to buy as many expensive cakes as you can but whats the maximum that you can buy,5
teacher:But you only have 2100 yen so so in fact how many 230yen cakes can you buy;student:Nine,5
teacher:What do you need to do in order to buy 230yen cakes and up to how many can you buy and bring home,5
teacher:What should you do,5
teacher:What would you do,5
teacher:Then how are you going to think about it,5
teacher:But if you buy 10 230yen cakes how much will it cost,5
teacher:Then how do you need to think about it in order to find out how many 230yen cakes to buy,5
teacher:How are you going to think about it,5
teacher:Well then how can you find out how many you can buy,5
teacher:So how do you think about this,5
teacher:Not by using equations or things like that but tell me what you have to do to get the answer,5
teacher:How did you think about it,5
teacher:Keep reducing and when you do it with eight on this side and two this side then;student:So then you keep reducing the numbers and,5
teacher:When you did it;student:When I did it,5
teacher:Then how much does it become,5
teacher:How many cakes that are 30 yen cheaper do you need to buy in order to make up the 210 yen shortage,5
teacher:How many cakes that are 30 yen cheaper do you need to buy to make up the 210 yen shortage,5
teacher:Then if you buy seven of the cakes that are 30 yen cheaper if you do that then what about this side,5
teacher:What is the equation,5
teacher:Okay Sakai how much is it here when you take the parentheses off,5
teacher:Multiply this and this,5
teacher:How much is it when you multiply it;student:Mm,5
teacher:How much is it if you take off the brackets,5
teacher:Well then how do you do two bracket X plus three,5
teacher:Bracket 200 times 10 is see,5
teacher:Then which is the next one that you transpose,5
teacher:Itll become 10,5
teacher:What will 10 become if you write it in decimals,5
teacher:Which is easier doing it onebyone or using an inequality equation,5
teacher:And what about this one,5
teacher:And what about here,5
teacher:This is 120 X plus how much is this if you multiply it by this,5
teacher:Then work it out there will you,5
teacher:If you do that what would the cost be if you bought only X number of 230yen cakes,5
teacher:Then if this is X then what is this,5
teacher:What will this become,5
teacher:And the problem is if you make the number on this side X then what will this be if you do that,5
teacher:Then how did you think about this one,5
teacher:In order to buy as many 230yen cakes as possible what is the maximum that you can buy,5
teacher:And what is the thing that you want to find,5
teacher:What do you need to answer,5
teacher:Then Qumi,5
teacher:If its six of this cake then how many of this cake do you need to buy,5
teacher:How did you calculate it,5
teacher:Which cake seems more delicious,5
teacher:So how do you calculate it;student:Four,5
teacher:Whats the equation here,5
teacher:What do you add to six to get this ten;student:Add,5
teacher:Then then how many is it here,5
teacher:If this is six then its probably how many here Ryusaki,5
teacher:Qumi is saying that its four but how do you get this here,5
teacher:Its four but how do you come up with four,5
teacher:Ryusaki how do you come up with four here,5
teacher:Yeah so how do you calculate it;student:Because its not enough,5
teacher:Arai do you understand what this problem means,5
teacher:Do you understand the meaning of the problem,5
teacher:Where was it strange when you were doing it,5
teacher:Then this one also can you try thinking if it can be found by formulating a mathematical expression,5
teacher:How would you do it;student:What am I supposed to do,5
teacher:By the way what day is this;student:No,5
teacher:That means the answer is,5
teacher:And if you can write the amount for X,5
teacher:And the answer;student:Yes,5
teacher:Then in the beginning well would you present just the mathematical expression right there,5
teacher:And when we put in a number for X which is bigger the left side or the right side,5
teacher:How much will this be,5
teacher:In this X if we still put in 13 how much is this,5
teacher:That means in this situation the values of the left side and the right side which is greater,5
teacher:Then doing it in the same way if we put in 14 if we put in 14 over here also how much will they be,5
teacher:And how would the size relationship be,5
teacher:How about it when its 15,5
teacher:Now with that okay,5
teacher:Can you try thinking if it will be found by formulating a mathematical expression,5
teacher:This value,5
teacher:And how did you obtain this;student:Over here is also 90 yen,5
teacher:Then how about over here,5
teacher:Now well is there any method to find it thats simpler,5
teacher:Is there any method to find it faster,5
teacher:Can you please find that,5
teacher:Is there any method to find the answer faster,5
teacher:Now if you have found the answer using one method okay arent there any other methods,5
teacher:What is this Y,5
teacher:This 180 minus 10 X is whose money is this,5
teacher:Then would you do it up to there,5
teacher:That is,5
teacher:How much is in that hum,5
teacher:If you do that then,5
teacher:Now well you can find it like that also but can you try thinking about whether there are any methods that you can use to find it faster,5
teacher:It was obtained as how many days,5
teacher:Then can you do it a little more,5
teacher:Can you do it without using the Y,5
teacher:Whose amount of money is this,5
teacher:Then how about the smaller brother,5
teacher:Then how about the second day,5
teacher:What goes in,5
teacher:Then how about over here,5
teacher:If we say that what kind of numbers can we say they are,5
teacher:Then just now um she said numbers more than 30 for us but then for example what number should we think about it,5
teacher:Then if we say one between these,5
teacher:After that;student:Ahh,5
teacher:Anything else,5
teacher:Thirty point;student:Thirty point one,5
teacher:Anything else,5
teacher:But about how many are there,5
teacher:Is thirty included or not included,5
teacher:Date please interpret this,5
teacher:Then you transpose and negative two X is greater than minus 10 and when you divide both sides what is wrong at this point,5
teacher:Where is it wrong here,5
teacher:If I told you to correct it where would you correct it,5
teacher:Eguchi here where should you correct it,5
teacher:How would you fix this,5
teacher:Which,5
teacher:Would you try saying it,5
teacher:And which is more,5
teacher:How about over here,5
teacher:Then now Im sorry but would you go up front and write this,5
teacher:Which is it,5
teacher:Is it the wrong mark or the right mark,5
teacher:How about it,5
teacher:How about it,5
teacher:That means what is this;student:Its greater,5
teacher:Numbers that are what than 14,5
teacher:When theyre the same,5
teacher:The question is how many milliliters had she poured,5
teacher:What should we place as X,5
teacher:Then would you point with your finger;student:I dont understand,5
teacher:Where is it,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:When we exactly go from this situation what part is it,5
teacher:What do we want to obtain,5
teacher:How much was the total here,5
teacher:In this situation what should we place as X,5
teacher:Could you write it,5
teacher:Righthand side,5
teacher:Two X plus 10,5
teacher:So you can write an equation about A and nine,5
teacher:So can what do you write on the left hand side,5
teacher:Or,5
teacher:So what is the meaning of this radical sign,5
teacher:Do you know do you understand whats the what is the meaning of square root of a number,5
teacher:What is the negative value of A if the square of A is nine,5
teacher:Can you find the answer,5
teacher:So how can you find that,5
teacher:How can you find that,5
teacher:So can you write an equation for me,5
teacher:What is the difference,5
teacher:What is the difference between this part and the and the previous question,5
teacher:If the square of A so which number,5
teacher:The square of which number,5
teacher:So now can we uh show the step like this,5
teacher:So how can you do that,5
teacher:So first of all what is the difference,5
teacher:So what is the positive value of nine,5
teacher:Now what is the positive value of A if the square of A is nine,5
teacher:How to write the square of three,5
teacher:So can you write a mathematical notation,5
teacher:So that can you write it on the blackboard,5
teacher:So what is the square of negative three,5
teacher:Negative three,5
teacher:So can you show the step,5
teacher:Okay the first the first line what do you what do you write,5
teacher:The first line,5
teacher:So you must write down what do you what did you find out,5
teacher:What did you find,5
teacher:The square of,5
teacher:And then square means,5
teacher:Whats the whats the meaning of square,5
teacher:So the answer next step what do you write,5
teacher:So the answer is whats the answer,5
teacher:So can you find the answers,5
teacher:No so you must add;student:No,5
teacher:Can you find the answers,5
teacher:So square root of 36 what is the answer,5
teacher:Negative square root;student:Negative,5
teacher:Okay who can do this for us,5
teacher:Okay number four,5
teacher:Number five,5
teacher:Is it equal to four or equal to negative four,5
teacher:So in this case the answer,5
teacher:Is it equal to two or negative two or no solution,5
teacher:Because take square root means what is the number times itself equal to negative four,5
teacher:How about negative two,5
teacher:How about this,5
teacher:Because negative two times negative two equals,5
teacher:So there is,5
teacher:So which number times itself is equal to a negative number,5
teacher:One is,5
teacher:Or,5
teacher:The other is,5
teacher:The other,5
teacher:The one of the answer is negative nine or,5
teacher:So A,5
teacher:So which number,5
teacher:So the answer is,5
teacher:What is the answer,5
teacher:So the answer is,5
teacher:Square root of 196 so the answer is,5
teacher:What is the what is the answer,5
teacher:So the answer is Lui Man Hing,5
teacher:What is the square of nine,5
teacher:Okay uh part G part G So the answer is Choi Ka Man,5
teacher:The answer is,5
teacher:Okay I,5
teacher:What is the answer,5
teacher:What is the answer,5
teacher:Do you know do you know how to express,5
teacher:So how do we wri write this,5
teacher:So how to write this,5
teacher:Okay H,5
teacher:So you can show the step;student:Right,5
teacher:So what is the answer;student:Six,5
teacher:What is the square of three,5
teacher:Furthermore we know the power of what Marketa,5
teacher:Give me a simple example,5
teacher:Okay and we also studied what else,5
teacher:Give me an example,5
teacher:This equals to;student:To the fifth power,5
teacher:This number stays the same and the exponent will be;student:Two and we multiply it by,5
teacher:Calculate 30 to the third power and describe to us how youre going to figure it out,5
teacher:Which totals;student:Raise the powers of three cubed,5
teacher:Its actually,5
teacher:Yes the exponent is an even number but in the other one the exponent is an odd number so what kind of number will you come up with;student:So it will be negative three to the fourth power is larger because we have an even number negative coefficiency,5
teacher:Negative but in this one the number will be;student:Negative,5
teacher:You know how you came up with this yes,5
teacher:Show us which rule you followed to complete this problem;student:I meant adding it up so the answer is seven to the fifth power,5
teacher:Okay why dont you pull down the board and point it out to us;student:That one up there,5
teacher:Dont put it in parenthesis six times;student:Six times,5
teacher:Because it will unfold into what Andrea,5
teacher:Tell me the power of a product Radka,5
teacher:The next three rules apply to Radka,5
teacher:Give me an example of two powered numbers that have the same main numbers,5
teacher:The only thing remaining is,5
teacher:Positive X minus X equals to,5
teacher:Zero and the only thing remaining will be the grand total of;student:X X zero X,5
teacher:Is there some kind of correlation or is it just a coincidence that its number one two three times two etc,5
teacher:So number two is to the first power four is,5
teacher:Number three is,5
teacher:I mean number eight is,5
teacher:Which rule applies to this;student:Three cubed,5
teacher:So he went on the roller coaster and he could have gone on the roller coaster how many times,5
teacher:And now we can simplify it as,5
teacher:We learned how to deal with powered numbers with the same main number and we learned to calculate what,5
teacher:And were trying to figure out what Kuba,5
teacher:Give me a calculation which includes two same main numbers,5
teacher:Youve said to the sixth power and,5
teacher:Please tell me guys what remains,5
teacher:Weve also studied powered numbers with the same main number and its,5
teacher:So how many gifts is he going to buy,5
teacher:Maybe it is negative or,5
teacher:Which equals,5
teacher:Isnt there a simpler way,5
teacher:The second root of a problem we do an estimate based on what;student:Estimate,5
teacher:What do you need for that,5
teacher:Can someone calculate it on a calculator,5
teacher:That will be an approximate second root of what nearest squared number,5
teacher:Not from 64 but from the root of 64 and that equals,5
teacher:You will work with an area of what kind of geometric configuration,5
teacher:Triangle and;student:Trapezoid and triangle,5
teacher:To calculate the area of a triangle you need to know what,5
teacher:To calculate trapezoid you will need to know,5
teacher:What is this,5
teacher:Of this triangle and this is the height of;student:The height of this triangle,5
teacher:Why dont you round off the number;student:Two hundred and one point twenty,5
teacher:Lukine would you be able do describe the entire process;student:So it will be 200,5
teacher:Uh we have learned something about the square do you remember,5
teacher:So first of all what is the square of three,5
teacher:Whats the result;student:Negative 20 squared and plus 20 squared,5
teacher:Zero so what numbers remained untouched and remain to be calculated;student:Zero,5
teacher:Zero to the tenth power equals,5
teacher:Are there any other pairs we can cross out;student:Yes,5
teacher:So which rule will you follow;student:And youre supposed to calculate it,5
teacher:Stand aside and tell us which rule you will follow,5
teacher:Were dealing with power of quotient with the same;student:This one,5
teacher:First you calculate 12 squared which is how much,5
teacher:Point out the rule youre going to follow;student:X equals,5
teacher:Correct how did you figure that out;student:X equals 11,5
teacher:Which rule will you follow for this problem,5
teacher:Is there a simpler way of doing this,5
teacher:Move aside and point it out for us,5
teacher:Six times;student:Six times,5
teacher:Not to reduce a fraction but to calculate;student:So we can reduce a fraction to the lowest term,5
teacher:Negative 50 to the fifth power and plus Tom,5
teacher:Can you find another pair of numbers which can be crossed out,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:What else can we cross out which other pairs equal zero Vojta,5
teacher:Yes and;student:Negative 10 to the first power,5
teacher:He also could have instead of one he could have put in times,5
teacher:Answer,5
teacher:So uh if A squared we see uh by case so if A is positive then what is the value of A squared,5
teacher:If it is zero then what is the squ square of zero,5
teacher:What what are the differences between them,5
teacher:Can you find out the difference,5
teacher:Can you find the difference between them,5
teacher:If can you can you draw can you draw a foursided polygon it is equilateral and it is equiangular,5
teacher:Okay 25 you draw on this box,5
teacher:How do we call such type of polygon,5
teacher:When it is equilateral and it is equiangular,5
teacher:How how how do we call this kind of polygon,5
teacher:How yes how how do we call such type of polygon,5
teacher:Okay what is meant by a regular polygon;student:Regular polygon,5
teacher:Do you still remember the sum of the interior angles of a triangle,5
teacher:It is equal to,5
teacher:Do you still remember the abbreviation,5
teacher:The the abbreviation to describe such properties,5
teacher:We called quadrilateral okay for quadrilateral what is the sum,5
teacher:And then for equiangular 19,5
teacher:What is the sum of interior angles of it,5
teacher:Hey I want you to to draw this one,5
teacher:Would someone come out and and to draw,5
teacher:What is the difference between the convex polygon and concave polygon,5
teacher:What does it mean,5
teacher:What what does it mean,5
teacher:What does it mean,5
teacher:Okay what are the differences between convex polygon and concave polygon;student:Yeah,5
teacher:What are they,5
teacher:What is meant by equiangular polygon,5
teacher:And what is meant by equilateral polygon,5
teacher:What is meant by equiangular polygon,5
teacher:What does it mean by equilat equilateral tri polygon,5
teacher:Equiangular polygon,5
teacher:What does it mean,5
teacher:All the sides,5
teacher:How about equiangular polygon,5
teacher:All the sizes of the angle,5
teacher:You try try to come out and draw,5
teacher:Have you found out the sum of angle A angle B angle C and angle D,5
teacher:It means what is the sum of interior angles of a foursided polygon,5
teacher:Can somebody help me to fill in the blanks,5
teacher:And 10 positive 10 on the lefthand side righthand side,5
teacher:What does it mean,5
teacher:If I say that X equals two is the solution what does it mean,5
teacher:What does it mean,5
teacher:Okay when X equals two what is the lefthand side,5
teacher:Two X plus four whats the result,5
teacher:How about the others;student:Yes,5
teacher:Lau Wai Fung give me one more number for X other than two,5
teacher:Any one,5
teacher:Another value for X,5
teacher:Whats the value for the lefthand side,5
teacher:But for the righthand side X plus six X plus six,5
teacher:Okay how about equation two I get zero equals zero what does it mean,5
teacher:Then what will be the solution,5
teacher:What do you mean by anything,5
teacher:You try to correct this,5
teacher:Equation one or equation two,5
teacher:Some of you laughed it means that you find some mistakes which one,5
teacher:I want two of you okay to come out and find the solution for these two equations,5
teacher:Number 13 you try you try to fill in for for the first line,5
teacher:How to present the conclusion,5
teacher:How about we come to the conclusion,5
teacher:How to work out angle A plus angle B plus angle C plus angle D,5
teacher:Yes okay try try try to show it to us,5
teacher:Yes okay how how you got such answers,5
teacher:How to find the pentagon,5
teacher:Uh you can come out and draw anything you like to to tell me your your your result,5
teacher:If two diagonals are drawn from vertex A to the nonadjacent vertices C and D how many triangles are formed,5
teacher:What is the sum of the angles in each triangle,5
teacher:What is the total sum of the angles in all the triangles formed,5
teacher:What is the total sum of the angles of these three triangles,5
teacher:These three triangles,5
teacher:Altogether it is,5
teacher:What is therefore the sum of the interior angles of this pentagon,5
teacher:It becomes,5
teacher:It asks you to draw from vertex A to vertices C and D how many triangles are formed,5
teacher:Anybody try to tell me the difference between them,5
teacher:Can you tell me the difference between them,5
teacher:Can you tell me the difference between these two kind of polygons,5
teacher:What is the next step,5
teacher:Okay next how do we get the smaller number,5
teacher:You may ask you may say what if I want to eliminate the A,5
teacher:What should I do,5
teacher:What should I do to eliminate A,5
teacher:Then what should I do,5
teacher:When they are added together positive Y and negative Y will become,5
teacher:What should I do,5
teacher:I will need to,5
teacher:Well how do we do the elimination,5
teacher:Okay what do you do when you cancel the X,5
teacher:How do we do it,5
teacher:Cheng Ka Ho what do you think we should do to eliminate X;student:Move three X to the other side,5
teacher:Do you do you have any ideas,5
teacher:Now when you are doing the subtraction this is easy 19 minus 11 is equal to what,5
teacher:A is,5
teacher:What is the remaining unknown;student:Two A equals to 28,5
teacher:Well you can see in this situation that what is left after the summation is,5
teacher:Well but I said earlier that positive B plus negative B is how many,5
teacher:So is there any answer equal to negative,5
teacher:So thats what is this meaning of square root,5
teacher:How can it be number 24,5
teacher:Which one is bigger and which one is smaller,5
teacher:So what should I take away,5
teacher:The problem is how do we take A away,5
teacher:No sorry how do we take away B,5
teacher:Well what about here,5
teacher:How to take away B,5
teacher:So now positive B plus negative B is equal to what,5
teacher:Okay how do we add these two equations together,5
teacher:Adding two numbers is possible but how do we add two equations together,5
teacher:How do we add it,5
teacher:So 20 plus what,5
teacher:What is equal to A plus A,5
teacher:A plus A is;student:Two A,5
teacher:What is the sum of three plus negative three,5
teacher:And then if it is negative what is the result of the square of A,5
teacher:Chan Lap Man come up and do question number two,5
teacher:What do you expect to be eliminated by adding the two equations together,5
teacher:The LCM of three and two is,5
teacher:So three times what is six,5
teacher:How about this one,5
teacher:Two times what,5
teacher:Any impressions,5
teacher:Okay uh first of all you know what what I am now going to do,5
teacher:For uh how many sides,5
teacher:Five sides it is we call;student:Five,5
teacher:Do do you know the name of this uh polygon,5
teacher:I I I want you to draw another type do you know another type,5
teacher:Uh do you find that such kind of a polygon is different from these two,5
teacher:And at the same time how many sides for this polygon,5
teacher:Do you still remember what to call this kind of polygon,5
teacher:Do you find that what is the characteristic between them,5
teacher:What is the difference between them,5
teacher:So how do we make three and two the same,5
teacher:If you say if I want to eliminate the Y earlier I said I want to eliminate the X but if I want to eliminate the Y one is three and the other is two what should I do,5
teacher:How do we use the method of elimination,5
teacher:Y equals what is Y equal to,5
teacher:So if we have to use the method of elimination in this case how do we do it,5
teacher:Is there any way to make them the same,5
teacher:Therefore the rest of the equation will be,5
teacher:After multiplied by two the first part will be two X and what about the second part,5
teacher:Chan Kwan Wu after multiplied by two after multiplied by two,5
teacher:Four Y and then;student:The second part uh positive four Y,5
teacher:What do we do next,5
teacher:How do you work this out,5
teacher:Should we use addition or subtraction for the two equations,5
teacher:Two X minus two X is,5
teacher:If you add them together what will it be,5
teacher:Two X plus two X is what,5
teacher:How about this one,5
teacher:How many,5
teacher:So Y is equal to,5
teacher:So the solution,5
teacher:Addition or subtraction,5
teacher:Lucko how many problems did you calculate on your own,5
teacher:Please write number two okay,5
teacher:What are you going to write;student:For example how do we write the answer,5
teacher:From where to where does three Z go,5
teacher:Three times Z,5
teacher:Are you ready for D Y plus four times Z,5
teacher:What length;student:Now thats the the length,5
teacher:Who would like to show it,5
teacher:The letter E does not stand for a length anymore but in our case Debbie,5
teacher:In exactly the same way the letter K stands for Pascal,5
teacher:The letter A means in our case Tamara;student:Eh the admission fee for a child,5
teacher:And finally the letter B according to our problem Menhir,5
teacher:pays for the following Two times E plus three times K plus three times A plus B What can we make out of that,5
teacher:Please explain Fabian,5
teacher:Mhm yes namely;student:Ehm the family has to consist of five people,5
teacher:It consists of two adults three children What else;student:Two adults and three children,5
teacher:Has anybody an idea,5
teacher:Insert the straw What if I so in your opinion what is the longest straw laying in the box,5
teacher:Could you also mark in yellow what three Z is;student:We mark the length Z three times,5
teacher:Now how can I calculate the length of this straw;student:Eh  like this,5
teacher:You have,5
teacher:It will come out even better Fabian and Menhir if you comment on what you are doing,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:What do you mean by under,5
teacher:What does the arrow indicate;student:Not really,5
teacher:So now what indicates the direction to the right;student:Yes,5
teacher:What calculating operation,5
teacher:Could you also do the problem at the blackboard,5
teacher:In the;student:Also three times the five and then one times the three on the second line,5
teacher:C 13,5
teacher:And what lengths do we have at our disposal now,5
teacher:Which lengths do you have at your disposal now,5
teacher:Well what are they called,5
teacher:So how do we present the term X plus Y minus Z Fabian,5
teacher:Show the term X plus Y minus Z on your drawing Fabian,5
teacher:What would you change;student:It is correct,5
teacher:Here good Show us,5
teacher:Could you also name the partial lengths;student:The yellow here thats the length five times Y,5
teacher:Now reason within the group explain it to them;student:we find,5
teacher:So then how is it;student:Yes yes,5
teacher:What is the position,5
teacher:And where can I simplify again;student:I get an expression,5
teacher:Is it right or can you simplify something else;student:No,5
teacher:What do I do,5
teacher:Which root can I take away;student:Ah so you can take away the root its this,5
teacher:Now what have you found;student:Here we have to do it in the simplified way or,5
teacher:The measurement corresponds to,5
teacher:And pay attention extract the root but you have to extract what else;student:Okay,5
teacher:What did you apply in solid geometry,5
teacher:The direct square root what what is that;student:And that without eh without,5
teacher:What have we applied in solid geometry that we havent ever done Neluca,5
teacher:So all of you look looking at the transparency what do you have,5
teacher:Well Barbara would you like to try to come and explain it at the blackboard,5
teacher:Do it at the blackboard,5
teacher:The result;student:So we simplified we we took away the root and we squared it,5
teacher:On the second passage what did we write,5
teacher:Which is the hypotenuse,5
teacher:Eh in that triangle which is the right angle side;student:Right angle side right angle side,5
teacher:Having a rectangular triangle,5
teacher:But what did Pythagoras say;student:Now its more,5
teacher:How do you do it;student:Yes,5
teacher:Or as we said Instead of writing this I can write,5
teacher:Now try a bit you already did two calculations try to see if there is a faster way to calculate;student:But its right indeed,5
teacher:Its correct eh what you are calculating but Id like to see if you can shorten the calculation also write the unit eh,5
teacher:The;student:Because here,5
teacher:How do you complete the title,5
teacher:What is it that you apply,5
teacher:Twentysix Adrian,5
teacher:By doing these calculations what did you apply,5
teacher:Then now complete in your exercise book where there is what do you have,5
teacher:Box number,5
teacher:What did you apply to find these measurements,5
teacher:Call it straw or call it,5
teacher:Was which one was it,5
teacher:But take care that Lets look at your what did you do before explain it to me in words;student:It equals 48,5
teacher:Marisa what did you do,5
teacher:You are inexact what do you mean;student:We are inexact,5
teacher:Who will give it a try,5
teacher:Who is going to try,5
teacher:Not 27 or 26 but a total length would be here,5
teacher:Eleven times 11 equals;student:You know yesterday I calculated  11 times 11 as basic area,5
teacher:What else is there Sandra,5
teacher:Eleven times what equals 121,5
teacher:Some of you have already solved the third one Shane move on,5
teacher:Well well well What is 12 times 12;student:One hundred and sixtynine,5
teacher:In the first two cases I had,5
teacher:X plus 14 has to be zero and that will give us for X the two solutions;student:X plus 14 has to be zero,5
teacher:Hansueli asked a question can one write it down as a solution set and if so how,5
teacher:What do you have to fill in the brackets you can guess a little try it out and test,5
teacher:How can you proceed in order to get six X squared in the product,5
teacher:What have we got here,5
teacher:How can you get the product minus three with integers for now,5
teacher:How can I recognize if one of these four solutions is the correct one Samuel,5
teacher:How about the first case,5
teacher:How many X do I get there,5
teacher:This square can only be zero if X plus five is zero which means that X has to have what value Klaus,5
teacher:This square is zero how do we continue Anette,5
teacher:How can it be factorized that was my original question Michelle,5
teacher:What is it this expression,5
teacher:In this this row,5
teacher:If you calculate this multiplication what do you get then,5
teacher:The answer is,5
teacher:The bracket appears in both terms I factorize them what does this bracket multiply,5
teacher:Now what about that minus sign,5
teacher:How do you mean that,5
teacher:Can you tell me what the common thing is,5
teacher:Minus six plus three equals Hansueli,5
teacher:Which bracket can be found in both terms,5
teacher:What is the common expression that I will factorize Philipp,5
teacher:Now how does the content of the second bracket develop Philipp,5
teacher:Equals Benjamin what do we get,5
teacher:What does this expression mean and when can it be zero,5
teacher:Hmm well it is correct but how do you continue now;student:Is it correct now like that,5
teacher:of what does this X squared plus 10 X plus 25 remind you,5
teacher:Of a binomial formula correct and which one of them;student:Of a binomial formula,5
teacher:Who can reconstruct how I got to these two terms in this bracket,5
teacher:Practically what did you do here;student:Well I didnt under well I didnt understa I didnt understand  how to arrange,5
teacher:Second case How many X do I get here,5
teacher:And,5
teacher:What is there to do,5
teacher:How can you present the number 17 with blue sheets of five,5
teacher:and with yellow sheets of three,5
teacher:Give it a try Fabian,5
teacher:Comment on what youre doing,5
teacher:Okay Now where can the number 17 be spotted;student:Yes exactly,5
teacher:Can you show it Tamara,5
teacher:Do you have another idea,5
teacher:Namely;student:Mhm yes,5
teacher:Present the number of 26,5
teacher:Sandra please also comment on what youre doing,5
teacher:And further Andi,5
teacher:What is the length in this case here,5
teacher:In reality that would be another length Patrick,5
teacher:And what would be the total length now;student:Six,5
teacher:Which one,5
teacher:How many times;student:Eh I subtract it from from the lower straight line from the right to the left,5
teacher:What exactly are you doing with these three with the length three that you have been adapting to the compass;student:I take the compass of three centimeters and mark it from the right to the left,5
teacher:Now explain to me what I should do on the other straight line Bal Rafael,5
teacher:There are Corinne,5
teacher:Nine X and what else;student:Nine X,5
teacher:Three X times minus one is,5
teacher:Three X times minus one is minus three X and then,5
teacher:Nine X and now Marc,5
teacher:Nine X,5
teacher:Plus minus;student:Two X,5
teacher:Six times three X six X times three,5
teacher:Plus two X and;student:Eh plus,5
teacher:One hundred and fortyfour is the square of what number,5
teacher:Eleven times 11 we saw before and whats next,5
teacher:Where;student:There is no square number here in number E,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:A variable is another word for it is,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:Who can say in words how he is going to mark three times five on the upper straight line,5
teacher:What do you mean;student:Do I have to  number 11  now,5
teacher:What was T one,5
teacher:Which calculation did I do;student:Yes,5
teacher:C,5
teacher:Theres something which doesnt work therefore youre going to say X equals the whole,5
teacher:If I take this X what do I do to take away this X,5
teacher:Where are you there;student:Is it possible that equations dont work like that one,5
teacher:For E Well minus four X plus 15 well what;student:Er here what do we do,5
teacher:Eleven minus 15,5
teacher:Possible not possible,5
teacher:S equals,5
teacher:That ones okay and then that one why is it whats this six X,5
teacher:Where does it come from this six X,5
teacher:Therefore if I do plus five X yes Miss youll have X here the 15 will fall wonderful equal,5
teacher:And then youll have five X plus,5
teacher:When you look at this what happens,5
teacher:What is bothering me here,5
teacher:In a global way whats bothering me,5
teacher:So I do only the minus 15 and I find minus four X is equal to,5
teacher:What do you find,5
teacher:But whats bothering me also,5
teacher:Therefore youre going to find how much;student:It takes away each time er,5
teacher:Therefore,5
teacher:And now we do one stage where we do times a,5
teacher:Its on the left so whats bothering us,5
teacher:And what does it mean that its 15 quarters,5
teacher:When one looks at D for example where one has four X its what in D,5
teacher:Two X minus 16,5
teacher:If I do times a half how many Xs do I have here,5
teacher:Therefore for the first we shall say what,5
teacher:So here we get to two X is equal to,5
teacher:Minus;student:Minus one,5
teacher:It seems to me I dont know And then after;student:divided by two,5
teacher:X is equal to,5
teacher:What changes for you,5
teacher:No you cant After what must you do;student:And after we do it like that,5
teacher:And what will we get,5
teacher:Minus 32 is equal to;student:Well its minus 32,5
teacher:And you find X,5
teacher:Therefore I find X equals,5
teacher:Minus two pencils how many have you got,5
teacher:Equals;student:It does minus seven X,5
teacher:To take away the five you did what,5
teacher:If you had only five X what would you do,5
teacher:If you had only the you would do times,5
teacher:Whats bothering you,5
teacher:Well which is the one bothering you;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Where are there the most Xs,5
teacher:On the left or on the right,5
teacher:So you stay on the left and then you take away,5
teacher:Therefore now,5
teacher:Can someone raise their hand and tell me whats one obvious thing that I can do to graph,5
teacher:Use the slope with the;student:The slope,5
teacher:Is there another way though;student:Yeah,5
teacher:What are we going to do,5
teacher:Twothirds times zero is what,5
teacher:Plus eight is;student:Zero,5
teacher:Well yeah which one;student:Well we  another fraction,5
teacher:Well then how do we take away a fraction,5
teacher:Whats bothering you;student:The first I didnt understand why,5
teacher:Therefore one can say its,5
teacher:Then now how are you going to take away this minus X,5
teacher:So what do you do,5
teacher:And then it will give us what;student:Hmm,5
teacher:So it makes X but 21 divided by seven;student:Why does it stay  why,5
teacher:How do I eliminate the Xs,5
teacher:What does it give me,5
teacher:Whats bothering me now,5
teacher:And then we find two X is equal to,5
teacher:Which gives us X equals,5
teacher:So how are we going to see that,5
teacher:What does this mean graphically,5
teacher:If I do the axis of the Xs here the axis of the function G of X and D of X the function on the left and the function on the right four X its what,5
teacher:the origin of four X I start from where,5
teacher:Here it starts from zero and each time it advances it goes up how much,5
teacher:Therefore it means I go from where,5
teacher:Therefore when do they meet each other these two parallel lines,5
teacher:The G part what do we have thats tricky,5
teacher:Therefore whats bothering you here,5
teacher:Well yeah and what;student:Because I can do it but in two stages,5
teacher:Which will give we take away the X X equals;student:Yeah a half,5
teacher:Minus;student:Minus,5
teacher:So what do we want to do first,5
teacher:And then it gives us,5
teacher:X plus five is equal to;student:X plus five,5
teacher:Minus three and what do we want to do now;student:Minus three,5
teacher:Whats bothering us,5
teacher:Its the five which is bothering us therefore we do;student:Minus five,5
teacher:Therefore X is equal to,5
teacher:Its H We have eighteen X er minus 24,5
teacher:Eighteen X minus 24 is equal to,5
teacher:72 plus 17 X What do you want to do,5
teacher:What must we choose first,5
teacher:So on the right we only have the,5
teacher:So what is bothering us on the left now;student:The numbers,5
teacher:Its,5
teacher:So for G we have three X plus five is is equal to two X Ludivine,5
teacher:It makes X is equal to;student:It makes X,5
teacher:In doing plus nine X in doing plus nine X whats interesting is that here we have X because plus nine X minus eight X,5
teacher:What do we want,5
teacher:X equals 36 exactly Letter D;student:Therefore we do plus six which means X equals 36,5
teacher:What do you do,5
teacher:Now that we are learning what to do what do you do,5
teacher:We know that in an equation we must put a little vertical bar and what must we do;student:Well,5
teacher:What do we do to make our equation equivalent,5
teacher:Youre searching like this The idea is to do what;student:Yeah,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:Therefore what must I do to take away this minus 24,5
teacher:Whats the basic idea in all these problems there,5
teacher:What are we trying to do as a final aim,5
teacher:So here what do we do,5
teacher:It suppresses the two X and what stays;student:the two X and then er,5
teacher:Aurore what can we say for E,5
teacher:Which gives us X equal to,5
teacher:For F,5
teacher:So if we do plus eight X What happens if we do plus eight X;student:Well er since we want to eliminate the eight well since we want to find X we put we do plus eight X,5
teacher:Here we must take away the X but what are we trying to do,5
teacher:For er the B,5
teacher:Therefore the 18 X that Im going to subtract minus 17 X theres going to stay,5
teacher:Well the minus 24,5
teacher:When four objects are worth 15 francs what do you do to know the price of an object,5
teacher:It needs a quarter and what happens;student:Yeah,5
teacher:No X equals;student:How,5
teacher:And then;student:If we take away the five afterwards we have four X is equal to 15,5
teacher:So thats annoying because you,5
teacher:You have already done the next one but we do times one third then we will find;student:do three,5
teacher:X is equal to;student:Uh,5
teacher:But what do you do here,5
teacher:What are you going to find,5
teacher:Minus 19 plus seven,5
teacher:Minus,5
teacher:Minus 19 plus seven;student:Well uh,5
teacher:Minus 19 plus seven,5
teacher:Youve got 19 objects missing someone gives you back seven how many do you have missing,5
teacher:Then after that what do we do,5
teacher:Equals;student:Yeah,5
teacher:So what happens when you take away five,5
teacher:Whats the problem with C;student:Theres a problem with C,5
teacher:And then you can do times,5
teacher:give me,5
teacher:Yeah you want to isolate you want to isolate what;student:And er here B,5
teacher:But you want to isolate what and you want to keep what;student:Er I yeah but I havent understood,5
teacher:Whats bothering you,5
teacher:How do you take away seven,5
teacher:How do you get minus seven to become zero,5
teacher:So now what happens on that side there,5
teacher:And then what am I going to do with my 24;student:X,5
teacher:Now you want that only that only X therefore you,5
teacher:Therefore,5
teacher:find 20 minus five it equals well,5
teacher:And then you must divide by no you must dividetheres not 15 which must you must simply divide by,5
teacher:By;student:Twenty,5
teacher:So what will you be staying with,5
teacher:Three X three X equals;student:48,5
teacher:If you do minus 12;student:No er 36,5
teacher:Whats bothering you,5
teacher:Watabe please write number one okay;student:Uh wait a second,5
teacher:T N yes write it down T N equals equals,5
teacher:What is two times N,5
teacher:Namely Maarten,5
teacher:Okay so thats when I know the surface area of a square how do I determine the sides again,5
teacher:I would like to know what the size the lengths are of the square A B C D,5
teacher:for example whats the length of A B,5
teacher:How can we do that,5
teacher:By which method,5
teacher:What is the surface area of the large square of the O E F G,5
teacher:How much,5
teacher:What is the surface area of one of those triangles,5
teacher:How do we calculate that again,5
teacher:What is the outcome according to you if you are just able to see it,5
teacher:Correct but how are you able to calculate that again;student:And there are four of those,5
teacher:And then,5
teacher:Namely that is,5
teacher:What am I able to say about the surface of this square and that square,5
teacher:However those triangular protractors how exact are they really,5
teacher:What are we going to say now,5
teacher:Or in a different way,5
teacher:So what should we call this side,5
teacher:What should I do to end up on to the black line again,5
teacher:Tell us what do you know about it;student:Pete Pete Pete,5
teacher:Who else can say more about it,5
teacher:Does anyone know when you would use the Pythagoras theorem and what you would use it for,5
teacher:What wellknown triangles do we know,5
teacher:What is a characteristic of a rightangled triangle;student:Isosceles,5
teacher:What other kinds of triangles do we have,5
teacher:What is characteristic of an isosceles triangle,5
teacher:What else do I know about an isosceles triangle,5
teacher:If I look at angles for example,5
teacher:Which one,5
teacher:What is characteristic of an equilateral triangle;student:Oh,5
teacher:Would there be anything else I can mention about an equilateral triangle,5
teacher:And can we tell how wide they are,5
teacher:One hundred eighty divided by three and that is;student:Yes 180 divided by three,5
teacher:But if you see this triangle what can we call that side,5
teacher:What are we going to look at,5
teacher:then what is the surface area of the square that is attached to it,5
teacher:And that is,5
teacher:How could we calculate again the surface area of such a triangle,5
teacher:How did we do that;student:I agree,5
teacher:What can you make of this of that one triangle,5
teacher:What is the surface area then of that rectangle,5
teacher:And what part of the triangle is it,5
teacher:Five tiles together make the square A B C D A B C D What is the surface area of that square,5
teacher:What is the length then of A B given the surface area of that square is five,5
teacher:Now we have to fill in the length of A E A E goes from here to there,5
teacher:And that is then twice,5
teacher:How can we write the two differently,5
teacher:How can I write the two into a square root;student:to write the two differently,5
teacher:What is two equal to again,5
teacher:What is the outcome of this then,5
teacher:But if you want to calculate that one what do you need then,5
teacher:And what is this 196,5
teacher:And what is the shape of that tiled part,5
teacher:How does the whole diagram look the whole garden,5
teacher:What does it look like the example the diagram;student:How can you determine how much of it is tiled,5
teacher:And then I would indeed want to know how long is the hypotenuse;student:Then the other one is five,5
teacher:What do I know about the large square then,5
teacher:That 144 plus 25 and that is;student:One hundred fortyfour plus 25,5
teacher:Of this of this side of the square;student:Which angle,5
teacher:Namely,5
teacher:I want to know the hypotenuse,5
teacher:What have we done,5
teacher:What did we do with this rightangled side,5
teacher:To the right always one step to the right what are you supposed to do to get back onto the line;student:Yes well arent you arent you supposed to go down like that,5
teacher:What did we do with that,5
teacher:What is it equal to,5
teacher:As in how long is the side going to be that I am about to fill in Rick,5
teacher:So here I have what were we supposed to do;student:What,5
teacher:So what did we see,5
teacher:What is is that squared,5
teacher:Or in other words what is the surface area of the square that you attach to it Julie,5
teacher:And that gives you,5
teacher:How did we determine the surface area of the other square again,5
teacher:What line does it have to cut and its not intersecting it is cutting;student:Um where it where it intersects,5
teacher:How do you always find the starting number,5
teacher:From that what line did we have here,5
teacher:Who can explain a little bit more,5
teacher:Which ones uh are descending,5
teacher:Mark which of the four are descending,5
teacher:Descending lines,5
teacher:Yes but where does the minus mark have to be;student:If it has a little minus mark,5
teacher:What is the difference in starting numbers between these descending lines,5
teacher:What is the starting number of A,5
teacher:What is the starting number of D,5
teacher:Which one belongs where,5
teacher:How can I find that one in here,5
teacher:What is the deal with that,5
teacher:Um Casper why dont you name one,5
teacher:And what else did we come across,5
teacher:So you should have;student:I dont understand that,5
teacher:What do you need for a linear equation,5
teacher:Okay but why uh what if the four were over here,5
teacher:Okay try to explain to me which one of these four lines belongs to that,5
teacher:Arnela would you like to try one,5
teacher:Who wants to do the first one,5
teacher:Up to how many pears can you buy,5
teacher:Then what is the cost,5
teacher:Is there anyone who knows what is 12 times 12,5
teacher:If you do that then how many 50yen persimmons do you buy,5
teacher:Um Simon what did you get,5
teacher:What is your answer to question 23 A;student:Nothing,5
teacher:What is your answer,5
teacher:What is the starting number,5
teacher:Whats the equation,5
teacher:And then,5
teacher:One plus,5
teacher:What do you notice about these last two equations,5
teacher:Is that one different or is it also the same,5
teacher:How do you know what letter what letter is separate,5
teacher:What will the answer be,5
teacher:that you take one when I call your name you may select one one equation and then you may explain to me why it belongs to that line,5
teacher:times zero point five and then;student:Plus one,5
teacher:Will you indicate how you got the numbers;student:Well then,5
teacher:How do you find that in,5
teacher:Which Y axis is here,5
teacher:Okay what is the vector number the slope;student:Five,5
teacher:Okay you should always begin with;student:Minus three,5
teacher:And the last one;student:Oh and the last one too,5
teacher:So what do you get,5
teacher:And something has to be inserted;student:Oh no it is four four,5
teacher:Is it a positive four or a negative four;student:Yes but thats what I cant figure out,5
teacher:Tell me about it,5
teacher:And then over here is the,5
teacher:Is it a positive five or a negative five,5
teacher:Is it a positive or a negative number,5
teacher:Look what which one did you have,5
teacher:What sequence will you take each time,5
teacher:Whether this is linear;student:I dont quite get four,5
teacher:The first way was,5
teacher:Do you remember that series we just wrote down;student:No that is two,5
teacher:And now whats the starting number,5
teacher:What and what is it,5
teacher:What comes after that;student:Minus three is,5
teacher:Minus three is,5
teacher:H Okay H equals is a good way to start;student:H,5
teacher:So it is,5
teacher:So do you add it up or do you subtract it,5
teacher:Now you still have to,5
teacher:Can you tell me what would happen if you went 10 steps to the right,5
teacher:How many steps do you have to go down then,5
teacher:Where are we,5
teacher:Which letter is the outcome;student:Yes,5
teacher:Here it lies at the 10 and here it lies at the;student:Oh that point,5
teacher:Can you now figure out for each line what the starting number is what the vector the slope is and what the equation is,5
teacher:Would you without having your book open be able to write down an equation of those four lines;student:Right,5
teacher:Would you,5
teacher:Would you like to give that a try,5
teacher:What do you need to know before you can make an equation,5
teacher:How do you start your equation;student:Yes,5
teacher:Well great then lets see what you have;student:Thats what we have,5
teacher:That has gotten how many times smaller,5
teacher:What what equation do you end up with,5
teacher:Surface area is square A E F G How does A E F G go;student:How does one calculate this,5
teacher:How much is what what is the surface area again of one of these angles,5
teacher:How much is three times 40;student:What is,5
teacher:And how much is three times four,5
teacher:And what is uh the outcome of the whole equation,5
teacher:How can you get this equa multiplication to resolve,5
teacher:X times four X is that four X squared or not,5
teacher:X times what,5
teacher:Four X times What makes four X squared,5
teacher:And four X times what makes 12 X,5
teacher:If you apply that then you can write down,5
teacher:Where do I have to fill in these two parts;student:Yes,5
teacher:What have you got;student:No I tried without any,5
teacher:Lisa where do I fill this in,5
teacher:Where does it belong,5
teacher:Lisa please complete the multiplication correctly,5
teacher:Minus two X times what is minus two X squared,5
teacher:So what do you notice and what is the answer for B,5
teacher:Where did the little squared come from Lisa;student:Um I dont know,5
teacher:Three times the four is,5
teacher:How much is three times what is shown in between brackets;student:Yes but over here it has three times behind it,5
teacher:What did we just calculate;student:Is that times three,5
teacher:Tell me what number you want to fill in,5
teacher:Go ahead and calculate it,5
teacher:Is;student:Plus 12,5
teacher:What do you think the outcome will be;student:So then its,5
teacher:Three times minus six equals,5
teacher:Plus 12;student:Yes,5
teacher:Times;student:And three,5
teacher:Yes what particularity do you notice;student:So did I also answer B since these are the same,5
teacher:What is the surface area of that,5
teacher:What is the surface area of the other area,5
teacher:How do you calculate a surface area to begin with,5
teacher:What is the length here,5
teacher:What is the width,5
teacher:So you have to take 60 and what are you supposed to subtract from that,5
teacher:Three times the X is,5
teacher:Times;student:Oh times X,5
teacher:Minus two X times what,5
teacher:Makes minus 54 X,5
teacher:What times three gives you this,5
teacher:This one where can you put it as well,5
teacher:Yes which resolution are you doing in that case;student:There,5
teacher:Which one didnt work,5
teacher:What is it;student:Yes,5
teacher:Which one;student:The factor,5
teacher:That way you wont take out a T but;student:Oh right,5
teacher:Here you dont write a T but,5
teacher:What;student:Yes,5
teacher:No two H and six you can both be divide by;student:Yes that by three uh,5
teacher:How can you determine the little blocks from the first figure,5
teacher:Uh what is in number 30,5
teacher:Yes maybe but how do you explain that;student:Ninetysix  should be correct,5
teacher:What has that got to do with this five;student:Yes,5
teacher:What is the relationship between the number of the term and your equation,5
teacher:You had written down in the equation 18 X and,5
teacher:What equation would you write down next;student:Yes,5
teacher:What will the upper part look like Freek,5
teacher:A factor,5
teacher:So what equation do you get with brackets,5
teacher:Where does the minus three S squared come from in the table,5
teacher:This where do I have to fill this in,5
teacher:Where;student:Uh underneath,5
teacher:And the plus nine S,5
teacher:Suggest something,5
teacher:Three S times S makes,5
teacher:So once you fill in a one for the X well just put a one here somewhere what does that do for the Y,5
teacher:And here,5
teacher:Minus three S squared what exactly does that mean,5
teacher:Minus three times,5
teacher:S times;student:S,5
teacher:Yes squared but I want to resolve it completely to a multiplication;student:Squared,5
teacher:Nine S is in fact,5
teacher:And what do these two have in common,5
teacher:And what else,5
teacher:Okay equation,5
teacher:Twelve plus three is,5
teacher:What is that,5
teacher:Once I fill in a one for X then what does it say,5
teacher:How much are six As plus five As;student:Or do I just have to,5
teacher:How many Fs do you have here;student:Do you just have to,5
teacher:How many Fs do you have here;student:Huh,5
teacher:And here;student:Three,5
teacher:So whats the total;student:One uh three,5
teacher:Three Fs plus three Fs is,5
teacher:Therefore;student:Oh no here it says minus,5
teacher:Youre left with,5
teacher:Six minus five Fs equals,5
teacher:How many Ys do you have;student:Twelve Y minus Y is that 12 or is it,5
teacher:How many Ys did you get over here,5
teacher:No how many do you have here;student:One,5
teacher:The first section,5
teacher:How many do you have here,5
teacher:How many should be subtracted,5
teacher:Whats eight times what is eight plus 30,5
teacher:And eight plus 30;student:Thirty,5
teacher:What is three times 10;student:Yes,5
teacher:Eight plus 18 is;student:Six times eight is 48 oh no that is not correct,5
teacher:And how many of those little squares do I have in here,5
teacher:Yes so;student:Four,5
teacher:What is done wrong here;student:I dont see why this is wrong here,5
teacher:What does that triangle look like;student:Look it  is wrong but how are you supposed to know,5
teacher:What kind of triangle is this,5
teacher:And where did you put it,5
teacher:Like do I need 41 or do I need 40 or do I need nine,5
teacher:How many Ys do you have here;student:Yes,5
teacher:Then you can just say the other side is well what did you calculate,5
teacher:How much are three Es plus seven Es;student:Yes because you have two Es,5
teacher:So two E times three E;student:Oh,5
teacher:Two times three is,5
teacher:What is the solution to this,5
teacher:And what is the solution to this,5
teacher:And over here;student:Is 66,5
teacher:Three times six is,5
teacher:How many how many Es do you have;student:Yes if you add that then the outcome is,5
teacher:Okay well what is the surface area of that,5
teacher:How many do you take away,5
teacher:Suppose for example you fill in three for Y,5
teacher:Um what should you do though,5
teacher:How do you plot an equation,5
teacher:How do you start,5
teacher:How are you going to plot the equation itself,5
teacher:But how will you get those lines,5
teacher:The table A if you fill in the Xs and calculate the Ys which numbers do you need to fill in for that,5
teacher:What numbers are you going to fill in for the X,5
teacher:Very well if you fill in one what is the outcome,5
teacher:Which numbers can you do that with,5
teacher:Just name one,5
teacher:What is the outcome then,5
teacher:Three plus four is indeed seven and then;student:Seven,5
teacher:So what is the outcome at minus six,5
teacher:Minus six plus four is,5
teacher:What is the outcome at eight,5
teacher:Very well the Yaxis do you know anything about that,5
teacher:From how far to how far does that axis system need to run,5
teacher:How would you start,5
teacher:What are you supposed to do at 15;student:I dont know,5
teacher:Minus;student:Thirtysix,5
teacher:Um what is the surface area of the top part;student:Yes it is,5
teacher:What is the surface area of this here,5
teacher:How long is this section,5
teacher:What is the length of this here;student:Well um,5
teacher:What is the height of this,5
teacher:You dont know that yet that is just H Now how do you determine the surface area;student:Oh yes,5
teacher:So how many will you have left;student:One,5
teacher:Yes what did you get in uh the first part;student:Look this is question 18 E You have to take similar terms together,5
teacher:No what is this 120 about;student:One hundred twenty,5
teacher:Or how much is three times two D,5
teacher:With;student:Sir at 20 you just have to add uh,5
teacher:That is the surface area of this small section length times width is five times that H Five H The surface area of this whole square how long is this section;student:Yes,5
teacher:And this;student:Five,5
teacher:So what is the surface area;student:Five,5
teacher:Um what are you supposed to do,5
teacher:How much is 120 times minus B;student:Yes,5
teacher:What is the result when you multiply zero times X cubed;student:It can be used as well,5
teacher:Would that answer work or is zero a more accurate answer,5
teacher:Okay I would like to know how did you come up with number five,5
teacher:Now can you show me  who owns five Lego blocks please,5
teacher:Okay now perhaps you  can compare and see how many more Lego blocks does  David have than Paul,5
teacher:Now where are the five for Paul,5
teacher:Okay now how many more does David have;student:Right here,5
teacher:Why don t you match five of them,5
teacher:Okay maybe one of you can show me the eleven;student:And then you go from  here one two three four  five,5
teacher:Can  someone show me the eleven,5
teacher:Jim has three tennis  balls can you show us three,5
teacher:What does that make,5
teacher:Okay so Jim has three has  tennis balls and Don has how many more,5
teacher:So what does that make Don,5
teacher:Jim has one fewer than Don so what does that make Don  have;student:Five,5
teacher:Why don t you  show that to me,5
teacher:Show me the SS of four,5
teacher:And then show  me Jim s SS of three,5
teacher:Perhaps with the stones or with the Unifix cubes,5
teacher:So then how many tennis balls does Don have;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Okay could you show us the 14 Lego blocks that David has;student:How  many more Lego blocks does David have than Paul,5
teacher:How did  you figure that out,5
teacher:Okay how about that,5
teacher:Romina how would you read   that,5
teacher:Ask that each group leader has  the very first question when you get to your group  The  things that you re going to be working with today could you  just tell me what you have on your desk that you re working  with Devon,5
teacher:You have what on your desk;student:Um we have blocks and rocks,5
teacher:What else are we working  with this morning besides the bag,5
teacher:Perhaps Brian s group could tell us what you re doing,5
teacher:How  are you trying to solve the problem,5
teacher:Let s see what you re  using are you using any tricks to find the number,5
teacher:How are  you going to do that,5
teacher:Tell us what you re doing,5
teacher:And  Michael and Michelle what is it that you re doing,5
teacher:What are you doing there Brian;student:Eight eight s  the,5
teacher:How many do you have,5
teacher:How many do you  have,5
teacher:How many more does it say to have,5
teacher:Want to try the stones to make sure,5
teacher:Oh and how did you get that answer;student:Four,5
teacher:What did you have to  do with the three and one to get that answer,5
teacher:Maybe you could share with me what you  did on some of these problems,5
teacher:How much;student:I just do this by times eighty,5
teacher:How many you got,5
teacher:What is that four;student:Look ten is thirtyfour and ten times ten is one hundred so thirtyfour times ten is three hundred and forty   let me write that   OK then three hundred and forty times four which would be three hundred forty equals one hundred rods so three hundred and forty times four would be one thousand three hundred and sixty,5
teacher:What is that thirtyfour comes from,5
teacher:Then you are multiplying by;student:That is thirtyfour rods you would use to make ten steps,5
teacher:What is that four come from;student:And for four hundred it would be three hundred and forty times four since three hundred and forty would be one hundred steps so one hundred times four is four hundred,5
teacher:What is that four,5
teacher:So how about for eight;student:Yeah,5
teacher:So you re saying so how would you do for eight,5
teacher:How would you do for four how would you do for eight,5
teacher:So how many did you find;student:Any questions,5
teacher:So how many in total for eight for a ladder with eight steps;student:Now one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen,5
teacher:How many is that,5
teacher:Thirty what;student:Thirty I give up man,5
teacher:Thirtytwo for what;student:Thirtytwo,5
teacher:So how would you get for hundred then;student:It was seventeen and since five is half of ten five times two is ten so I just multiplied the number of rods by two and I got thirtyfour for seventeen rods,5
teacher:How do you,5
teacher:So my question to you is that how many would that be if we had  rods how many would we need to build a ladder with 10 steps,5
teacher:And how many,5
teacher:We did three together perhaps you can tell me what you did  on four;student:The second one and the first,5
teacher:How did you come up with that answer;student:Six,5
teacher:Okay how did you figure that out;student:We got two,5
teacher:How many times has the rabbit already jumped,5
teacher:And how did you do that,5
teacher:Okay and how did you do that;student:Minus,5
teacher:Can you tell me how you did that;student:Yeah,5
teacher:How would you read that;student:Hum minus two,5
teacher:So What does this look like,5
teacher:What does this now look like for you,5
teacher:suppose it stands up;student:A chain or a necklace or something,5
teacher:If its stand what would you call it;student:Like a tower,5
teacher:In this particular case what would you call this if we called this a ladder,5
teacher:Ok so how many steps do we have,5
teacher:How many steps;student:Yes,5
teacher:So this one is a ladder with one step and how many blocks;student:One,5
teacher:How many rods do I have here,5
teacher:Michelle what would that be,5
teacher:What  would that be,5
teacher:Do you know how mathematicians read this symbol here,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:What do you think Saurabh,5
teacher:Where do you see the 6 in that illustration,5
teacher:When you and your partner are ready I want you to share with your partner where you think you see that 6,5
teacher:Before I ask for that answer I want you to now think private think time where is the 9,5
teacher:So who would like to share where do you see the 6 here,5
teacher:Tell me where do you see the 9 in this illustration,5
teacher:Osi where do you see the 9,5
teacher:Where do you see the 2 in this illustration and where do you see the 3,5
teacher:Where is the 2 and where is the 3,5
teacher:Go ahead and share that with your partner,5
teacher:So what do you think about this,5
teacher:Who wants to tell me what you think,5
teacher:So how do we relate this back to the illustration,5
teacher:How do we see that here,5
teacher:What do you think about this one,5
teacher:So what do you think about this one;student:Because if he kept going on he would have 12 and its not 9,5
teacher:What do you think of this,5
teacher:Okay  he would have gotten what;student:Whoever did the problem they could have like um they could have just added the 2 chocolate the 2 cups of chocolate and the 1 cup of cream which would have equaled 3 and then divided it by 9 which would which would actually for every you would get like 3 since 3  3 is 9 youd get 3 um 3s and for every 3 thered be like 2 cups of chocolate and thered be 1 cup of cream which would have eventually if youd have added up all the 2s you would have gotten  cups of chocolate,5
teacher:And then go ahead and share with your partner when youre ready,5
teacher:How about the first one,5
teacher:What do you think of that solution,5
teacher:What do you think of this solution,5
teacher:So what do you think,5
teacher:What do you think about this one,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Can somebody else explain that to me,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Whats going on with this,5
teacher:What do you think of this one,5
teacher:Any other ideas from Daniel,5
teacher:What do you think of the diagram,5
teacher:What would you like to tell us about this one,5
teacher:So they used the 9 cups from there but say what was the rest of that;student:Because the student thought um misunderstood that the 9 cups was only for the cream so then he multiplied another one because there are two ingredients to get the answer,5
teacher:Do you know which one,5
teacher:Okay what do you think of this one,5
teacher:So thirtytwo and how many you said you had for a hundred;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Kevin what are you thinking,5
teacher:What would you think of that,5
teacher:Okay what will I write here to say he just   took twelve out;student:He took an extra every single time,5
teacher:How many less,5
teacher:How many less,5
teacher:How do you suppose we write that;student:Yes I do,5
teacher:Do you know how   Mathematicians would write that,5
teacher:Somebody come and   write it,5
teacher:Uh Matt would you come and write that;student:Seven minus twelve equals five,5
teacher:How do you suppose that we can write that to make it not look like its take away five;student:Uh huh,5
teacher:Brian you want to come and   try it,5
teacher:Are there more in the bag now or fewer than when Jeffery   said go,5
teacher:It is saying there is one more than what,5
teacher:One more than  what,5
teacher:Than there were when;student:Than there were,5
teacher:Okay are there more or fewer than when Jeffery said go;student:He takes a whole handful of twelve,5
teacher:How many fewer;student:Fewer,5
teacher:What is it that this is saying,5
teacher:How many more;student:There are more now,5
teacher:Now are there more of those pieces of glass in the bag uh  than there were when Amy Lynn said go or there are     fewer;student:I believe so,5
teacher:Okay so when we say that s equal to zero up there is it true or false;student:Zero,5
teacher:but remember that whatever   number you put in the first box what do you have to do,5
teacher:What,5
teacher:So what do we know about six;student:Why don t you pass the paper down,5
teacher:Which list does six go in,5
teacher:Does work or   doesn t work,5
teacher:Can somebody come and show that;student:Oh I  don t want it to be right,5
teacher:Matt can you show  that,5
teacher:What would you think of that,5
teacher:Ankur can you come and see whether the two really,5
teacher:How much is that,5
teacher:How much is that,5
teacher:And so when I say that s equal to zero is that true or false;student:Thank You,5
teacher:Okay so how about two,5
teacher:Do I put the two  here or here,5
teacher:So it says nine minus fifteen how much is that,5
teacher:how much is that,5
teacher:And so this starts out by being what;student:Two and three work that works,5
teacher:What do you mean,5
teacher:What do you do here to get a hundred,5
teacher:Where is this thirtyfour come from;student:So then I went over here and thirtyfour times ten,5
teacher:So the roll radius when I have a zero as the narrow diameter is equal to what,5
teacher:So what is the W then,5
teacher:So youre using the numbers but if you didnt have the numbers what would you say is changing,5
teacher:Whats happening with the wide diameter,5
teacher:So as we increase the wide diameter what happens to the roll radius,5
teacher:So  now if I have the wide diameter as the same because its vertically in these columns and I change the narrow diameter what happens to the roll radius,5
teacher:So how would you describe what her strengths are,5
teacher:What does Gerry bring to the group,5
teacher:Which is larger three  quarters or two thirds,5
teacher:I know you dont have the rods yet but I want you  to try to imagine in your mind if you can remember what you  did when you solved the problem which is larger three  quarters or two thirds,5
teacher:By the way do you remember which  was larger,5
teacher:Can you think  about it in your minds what you built,5
teacher:Im kind of curious  what helps you remember Sarah,5
teacher:Michael what do you  remember,5
teacher:What are you thinking Meredith while were giving these   Erik  Alan,5
teacher:How would you account for that,5
teacher:Ok build the other model and then when youre done call me  back;student:Now we know that theres twenty four,5
teacher:How do you factor that in,5
teacher:Whats a threedimensional word for it,5
teacher:So how does that affect the roll radius,5
teacher:And in addition to that on your poster what I want to see is I want to see you guys taking turns to explain your thinking,5
teacher:Even if you didnt come to a solution your ideas are still valid and just as important as everyone elses so make sure that you guys are sharing your ideas,5
teacher:Number two is youre going to agree on a strategy for producing a joint solution thats better than your individual responses so if Cailin had the best response out of everyone in the group you have to create a response thats better than Cailins because four minds are better than one,5
teacher:So work together implementing your strategy and then think carefully about any additional data you want to collect,5
teacher:What do you need to help you find a solution,5
teacher:Because zeros the one where  okay my narrow diameters zero what does that mean,5
teacher:How does that relate,5
teacher:Now you guys kind of got to the conclusion or at least most of you did that the slant length correlates to the roll radius but how do the wide and narrow diameter relate to each other and to the roll radius,5
teacher:Okay where would the tip of the cone be,5
teacher:Well think about it what happens when you add that 9,5
teacher:A zero is added on but what happens to;student:Yeah but you make it,5
teacher:So what does that mean about the comparison of the wide and narrow diameter,5
teacher:It changes the what;student:Its very important and it changes the radius,5
teacher:So if I have a really really large wide diameter and a really really small narrow diameter how does that change the roll radius,5
teacher:So when its zero what would it visually look like,5
teacher:Oh what do we have here;student:Ok thats the second one,5
teacher:Tell me what we have here,5
teacher:Honestly Erik I could imagine if you explained to me what  Im supposed to imagine;student:Oh no those are singles,5
teacher:Show me the sixteen,5
teacher:So how would what number name would you give for the  differences between,5
teacher:The difference,5
teacher:Oh so what number name would you give to  that then,5
teacher:Um how  many you think there are,5
teacher:How many models do you think  you can build,5
teacher:What do you mean one for every single rod tell me what  you mean by that;student:Um if you know what youre doing and you know what  strategy you could probably build you could probably  build one for every single rod,5
teacher:What can be such a secret;student:You could you could build a thing you could build  fractions of every single rod if you know what youre doing  and you have a strategy or a secret that that you know will  work,5
teacher:How many do you think,5
teacher:Any thoughts,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Anybody else what  do you think,5
teacher:Um  to decide with the rods you have what was the smallest  model you can build,5
teacher:What  what do you think Mark,5
teacher:Sarah  what do you think,5
teacher:How did you get sixteenths,5
teacher:Whats one green,5
teacher:What are the green called,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:In what way;student:Well because see each model is different,5
teacher:Ok can you set that up in a different way;student:So its like  adding another blue but Im making a new rod,5
teacher:Use the same pieces but can you set it up a little differently;student:Well in thirds,5
teacher:I dont want to break your train of thought but whats  happening here;student:Ill show you what I mean,5
teacher:Basically you came here for what,5
teacher:David how about you explain to me what youre doing so I  can understand your thinking,5
teacher:The greens turned out to be what sweetheart,5
teacher:Okay so short and stout gave us  What is our roll radius there,5
teacher:And the reds came out to,5
teacher:Where are you going with it,5
teacher:What should we,5
teacher:What do you think Meredith,5
teacher:So you think the purples one twelfth  is there another name  for that purple,5
teacher:Is there another number  name for the purple,5
teacher:Ok we have one twelfth two twentyfourths four forty eighths anything else,5
teacher:How many different number names  and different blocks,5
teacher:This is so interesting where are you going with this then,5
teacher:Where are you guys at one two three or four,5
teacher:What I want you to focus on today is how can you relate the two diameters to the slant height and then how can you kind of think about the relationship between all three measurements,5
teacher:Yeah so remember what we talked about when we were referring to transformations,5
teacher:Which one of the two rules did you use;student:What I did was eight rods,5
teacher:What is it;student:The Evens,5
teacher:So how can you do that;student:Yeah,5
teacher:How about for a hundred and twenty;student:So that represents eight and eight times ten is eighty so it is twentysix times ten equals two hundred and sixty and minus two equals two hundred and fiftyeight,5
teacher:A ladder with hundred and twenty rods;student:Eh,5
teacher:A hundred and twenty,5
teacher:What is half of one twenty;student:So twenty that will be six times ten will be my sixty and twenty times two is two hundred minus the two is one hundred and ninety eight and that will be my sixty times two,5
teacher:So how are you going to do it;student:I know,5
teacher:So sixty divided by two that gives you what;student:And then my sixty times two is,5
teacher:So if we divide one hundred and twenty by two what do you get;student:Yeah,5
teacher:And then you build that ladder with that many steps;student:Sixty,5
teacher:Where is that sixty,5
teacher:Where is that one twenty;student:One hundred and ninetyeight,5
teacher:Six times what;student:That would be the two hundred,5
teacher:What do you mean sixty is one ninetyeight;student:Two hundred is right here then I subtracted two and make it one ninety eight and so sixty is one ninety eight,5
teacher:How did you do it;student:Two hundred sixty,5
teacher:How many you have;student:Yes,5
teacher:What do you mean;student:I didn t get even a single juice,5
teacher:How would you go for eighty,5
teacher:So how we are going to know;student:It is thirtytwo,5
teacher:Say for eight what would you do then for eight;student:I just noticed like I just multiplied by two and subtract two,5
teacher:Using that multiply by two what would you do;student:For eight,5
teacher:So how about for sixteen;student:First I did that and then since four times two is eight because you multiply it by two,5
teacher:Where does that twentysix come from,5
teacher:Oh twentysix times two and go on go on and what do you get;student:Twentysix twentysix,5
teacher:Before we do it can we find using this how will you do it;student:Hold on man,5
teacher:What are you trying to say,5
teacher:So how many you have for seven;student:Twentythree twentythree,5
teacher:So like for ten how would you do that;student:I take half of the number if it has a half I will multiply it by two and subtract two,5
teacher:How would you do that for nine,5
teacher:So if you have eight what would you do,5
teacher:So like for nine what would be the closest number;student:For numbers that do not have half I will take the closest number and then do half and then subtract two and then add three,5
teacher:That s for how many rods;student:Times two is twentytwo,5
teacher:That is for how many steps;student:Minus two is twenty,5
teacher:So how about eighty;student:Ooh in your face,5
teacher:Because here you are doing like this you are multiplying   so if I give you like a ladder for a certain number of steps then how you go about computing that   finding out the number of rods if you did not want to build them;student:Yeah,5
teacher:What did you do to get the number of rods for a ladder with ten and then hundred;student:Eh,5
teacher:And how did you get that one ninety eight for sixty;student:No one ninety eight,5
teacher:In which way,5
teacher:But six how many six has;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Can you put for six,5
teacher:So how many steps do we have;student:There you are happy,5
teacher:And how many do we have;student:Six,5
teacher:A ladder of two how many do they have,5
teacher:So you write eight you get what;student:Yeah,5
teacher:So let s see whether eight has twentyeight;student:Twentyeight,5
teacher:So then what we are going to do;student:Wait a minute I have twentysix,5
teacher:Alright so let s go to one twentyfive how did you get then;student:I got to be out of here,5
teacher:You always subtract that two where does it come from;student:I m right,5
teacher:What does it have to do with the ladder,5
teacher:What is the first word that comes to your mind,5
teacher:Take 30 seconds talk to your group and then were going to come back and kind of put up all the words we think of when we think of modeling,5
teacher:What did we come up with,5
teacher:What was a word you came up with,5
teacher:A ladder with six how many rods it has,5
teacher:So if you moved down to six how many six has,5
teacher:Let s do the same idea with eight   six,5
teacher:So is it like you are saying you had eight so how many six has;student:A ladder with two steps so I counted,5
teacher:Where is the ladder with sixty steps;student:For six steps equals too many rods and then six times ten is sixty so two hundred and,5
teacher:So basically what is this all about;student:So that I didn t have to make a big ol  ladder,5
teacher:This is   One ninety eight is what again,5
teacher:How will you do for one twentyfive,5
teacher:What is it;student:Yeah sixtytwo,5
teacher:How many you got,5
teacher:Yeah but then how many rods that ladder is going to have;student:It is sixtytwo half of one twentyfour,5
teacher:I am reading this and I know that onetwenty so what is the rule,5
teacher:Yeah can you figure that out;student:I have to figure that out,5
teacher:How did you find out OK;student:Then one twenty four divided by two is sixty two,5
teacher:So for one twentyfive what did you do,5
teacher:You went back to what,5
teacher:Then what did you do next;student:One twentyfour,5
teacher:And you got what;student:I did half of one twentyfour,5
teacher:Then what did you do with that sixtytwo,5
teacher:So you are saying you added eight to what,5
teacher:Now you were thinking in your head so I don t know so it is time for you to explain back to me;student:Two hundred and six rods,5
teacher:What do you  think,5
teacher:Whats going on here,5
teacher:And share it with your partner,5
teacher:How would you help Student A make sense of the plans in this table,5
teacher:How would you help Student A make sense of it,5
teacher:What else could we do what else could a person suggest to Student A to help them with their table,5
teacher:Okay so if you were to help them figure out that this was not 25 what would you tell them;student:You could tell them that you dont have to pay the first fee for every rental you just have to pay 1,5
teacher:So what would it cost for 1 movie from Online Flix;student:Uh that you dont pay the flat fee for every rental you just pay 1,5
teacher:And how did you get your 13;student:13,5
teacher:When will all three plans cost the same amount of money,5
teacher:Does this would this table if there wasnt the confusion with Online Flix help us answer that question,5
teacher:Amir what changes have you made for Student A,5
teacher:So if you rent 1 movie how much money is that gonna cost you,5
teacher:So how much will 1 movie cost you all together,5
teacher:So whats that going to be,5
teacher:So for then 2 DVDs how much are you gonna spend;student:13,5
teacher:And what about 3 DVDs;student:12 plus 2 equals 14,5
teacher:Which would be how much money;student:12 plus 3,5
teacher:So what are we learning about 0,5
teacher:What do  you remember about that Meredith,5
teacher:What did we learn about 0 with this table with Student As table that we didnt necessarily learn with Student Hs table,5
teacher:So is there would anyone else like to share about whether or not it makes mathematical sense,5
teacher:And what rod did you use to represent one sixth,5
teacher:What color rod,5
teacher:And what did  you get Meredith,5
teacher:Ok but she didnt combine them and shes calling the two whites  together again Meredith;student:You cant call them  you can call them separately but you could also call them combined  and if you combine them it would be uh one sixth,5
teacher:And two white rods would be,5
teacher:And one red would be,5
teacher:And youre calling two whites;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Ok Um whats the frequency for the bin thats the highest bar;student:Our group felt that it was pretty good match because when it says its most difficult and then we checked it the highest score is mostly in the lowest score while little bit to no people got the highest score of 90 or 100 percent,5
teacher:Could you justify that,5
teacher:What made you guys write that for histogram F,5
teacher:How many people got everything right,5
teacher:Ok um how many people;student:Yes,5
teacher:Boys and girls Im hearing some very interesting ideas so Id like for you to go ahead and share out;student:And then right here it says 12 25 38,5
teacher:So could you tell me which one does make mathematical sense and does follow the plan and which one or ones dont follow,5
teacher:So then were adding by what here Hailey;student:And it keeps going,5
teacher:What does 0 tell us about these three different plans,5
teacher:You want to tell us;student:Um,5
teacher:Come up and show us what the issue is;student:We had used our Cuisenaire Rods,5
teacher:Ok so what name would you give the yellow rod;student:called the one   and these would be  one  and these would be called the two  halves,5
teacher:Two fourths Do we have another number name for half of the  candy bar;student:We did two fourths,5
teacher:We said six twelfths two fourths we  said one half Brian,5
teacher:How did we get three sixths,5
teacher:What do you think about that,5
teacher:You agree then that if we call this one and we  call the red rod what number name,5
teacher:One fifth and we call the two whites together what number name did  we give it,5
teacher:I can also give it the number name,5
teacher:What else can I  call the two white ones besides two tenths,5
teacher:What did we decide,5
teacher:What other number name can I give the white ones besides  two tenths if I call the orange rod one,5
teacher:And what other number name can I  call the red one,5
teacher:Tell me what you did the last time Dr Martino was here,5
teacher:What was  the problem you were working on,5
teacher:Anybody want to tell me and tell Dr Davis,5
teacher:Do you all want to think for a moment and maybe discuss with  your partner to help you remember what you were working on,5
teacher:What s another number name,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:When we went to our candy bar we said one half  equaled,5
teacher:The first question does one half equal  two tenths,5
teacher:Can you tell me what that has to do  with my question,5
teacher:Erik do you want to do  you want to say what you think out to Brian,5
teacher:Could someone have told me  another name another number name for how much of the candy bar  I gave her,5
teacher:Can someone think of another name that very  exactly tells me how much of the candy bar I gave Dr Martino,5
teacher:Ok Are you ready to share your ideas,5
teacher:How many of you think you have another number  name that tells me how much of the candy bar Dr Martino got,5
teacher:How many of you think you  have a different number name,5
teacher:Tell us Meredith;student:No,5
teacher:Danielle why don t you come up  and show them what you re thinking,5
teacher:Can some one try to explain that,5
teacher:Somebody want to give it a try,5
teacher:Where are your four thirds,5
teacher:What do you mean by the other way around um Brian;student:But I thought about it the other way around,5
teacher:What do you think about that,5
teacher:So what do you think,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Can you help the class understand that,5
teacher:By how much;student:Yes,5
teacher:And what did you get to be one half,5
teacher:Just tell us,5
teacher:What about the boat and the children,5
teacher:What would you  expect to be the largest object and the next and the next,5
teacher:And howwhat size will you make them will that necessarily be the  same,5
teacher:Now what does that have to do with the models you made  and some of the comments that Michael and Erik made about the  models you made,5
teacher:What does that have to say about it,5
teacher:What would  probably happen if you did that,5
teacher:And what would happen  Meredith,5
teacher:So tell me what  you re thinking,5
teacher:In what way is it the same or different;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Which is bigger,5
teacher:What are you calling these,5
teacher:Yeah thats an interesting looking one tell me about it;student:That one,5
teacher:How does that work;student:I mean its bigger than one tenth I mean twelfth one twelfth one  twelfth,5
teacher:Could we call the difference between the two  thirds and the one half in this model another number name besides two twelfths,5
teacher:And what we supposed to figure out after we did that;student:Well we ve got we ve got that whole this is the whole we have the  three thirds and we then the half,5
teacher:What did you think,5
teacher:and then maybe while shes doing that in green does someone want to come up and color alongside of her the perimeter in green,5
teacher:Is there somebody that wants to come up and color the area of the rectangle,5
teacher:Of this square that Alex colored in,5
teacher:How are you going to show on the grid that youre taking away do you have an idea Asher;student:Taking away,5
teacher:What was it about,5
teacher:Can anyone tell me what it was about,5
teacher:What else  does anybody else remember what else it was about,5
teacher:Okay and when youre ready share with your partner what you would tell Robby,5
teacher:Who would like to explain what you would say to Robby if you wanted to tell him the difference between area and perimeter,5
teacher:What would you say okay,5
teacher:Is it still the same or does it change when your  model changes,5
teacher:Youre telling me how to get it so youre saying well what shape are you talking about,5
teacher:What Julian is doing,5
teacher:And whats area;student:Alex he shaded in the middle of the square  cause its the area,5
teacher:What do you think area is,5
teacher:Okay can anyone come in and color the area,5
teacher:Of this,5
teacher:Come up and color the area of it,5
teacher:Can someone come up and color in in green the perimeter,5
teacher:Does anyone want to come up and color in what the perimeter would be,5
teacher:One half or one  third,5
teacher:How much;student:Two thirds is still bigger,5
teacher:Can  you figure that,5
teacher:I don t mean for you to change your model I  mean is there any other way that you could show me what that  difference looks like without using the whites,5
teacher:Or this difference  here,5
teacher:What would that be;student:You could use a light green,5
teacher:And what did you say it was over here with the little one,5
teacher:And if you used the whites,5
teacher:What about for this one,5
teacher:But you have had two two different names for the answer if you did  it this way it was;student:That would be one sixth that would be one sixth and that one would  be one sixth,5
teacher:And and uh Gregory for this one over here where she had the  three what was the name for that one;student:It was two twelfths,5
teacher:Alright so tell me which is bigger,5
teacher:How many of you are  convinced you know how much bigger and no one can persuade you  otherwise that two thirds is not only bigger than a half but it is how  much bigger,5
teacher:You think you  showed something else in your second model,5
teacher:By the way what was one in that  model,5
teacher:What did you call one in that model,5
teacher:Oh but youre saying that youre saying that two thirds whats a  third;student:So they cant use those whites  to show it,5
teacher:And what s two thirds;student:A third is the purple,5
teacher:Is there any other way that you could show that  difference here than with the whites,5
teacher:Oh so what do you think;student:It was bigger by one sixth,5
teacher:And your original one was;student:One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven  twelve,5
teacher:And this one;student:This one was bigger by three eighteenths,5
teacher:Uh how many  more do you think you need,5
teacher:How  many do you think,5
teacher:So how much larger,5
teacher:My goodness tell me help me remember what it was over there,5
teacher:This is  different from the other one or the same,5
teacher:How s it different and how s it the same;student:It s different in a way and it s the same in a way,5
teacher:I agree with you  you re saying that two thirds is still bigger but it it bigger by a  different thing,5
teacher:Two thirds is bigger but now I want to know by how much,5
teacher:Hmm she used the orange and the brown is there something smaller  than the brown that you could put together that would work no add  onto the orange,5
teacher:Is two thirds still bigger Greg is two thirds still bigger than  a half on this model too or did it change,5
teacher:Ok Danielle what do you think about this time,5
teacher:What is two thirds;student:Well um two thirds,5
teacher:Can you build a two thirds and a one half for  him separate so we can then compare,5
teacher:What s the difference;student:Here s the two thirds and here s the half,5
teacher:How are the answers I don t understand what do you think  about this,5
teacher:Over here it was how much;student:One two three,5
teacher:This is there something smaller than this  brown that would work attached to this,5
teacher:Okay so what did you think about this one,5
teacher:Which is bigger,5
teacher:What do the rest of you think,5
teacher:What did you say it would  be,5
teacher:Which one of what;student:If you do that you just have to add for each one of those  you have to add one,5
teacher:Which way are you adding it;student:You have to add one more color per,5
teacher:Where are you putting that  one more color Milin,5
teacher:So this one with red on the bottom and blue on the top;student:See,5
teacher:And down  here you could put,5
teacher:Go ahead Jeff show me what,5
teacher:Why dont you do that;student:Yeah you kept on alternating,5
teacher:Can you tell me a little bit about how you would get the 8  now from here;student:There would be 3  high so there would be,5
teacher:Where where do we go  from 8,5
teacher:Well what is it;student:Sixteen,5
teacher:Any ideas Stephanie how to show from 4 to 8;student:Yeah,5
teacher:How about you Jeff;student:All right,5
teacher:Okay now what was his idea;student:No,5
teacher:And what is he asking us to do  with it,5
teacher:What happens if  youre building towers 3 high,5
teacher:Now he chooses to put it on the  top or bottom Milin,5
teacher:So 4 would be for what;student:You you like 2 times 2 would be 4 and then the 3,5
teacher:But do you know how many;student:I I did some but I didnt,5
teacher:You understand the question if I m calling  the orange rod one what number name would I give to the white  rod,5
teacher:So if you add up one tenth up how many times would you be  adding one tenth;student:Because if you line them up on the side and add them all up it will  be ten,5
teacher:Okay if purple were one half what would one be;student:If I called purple a half if I  called the purple a half what would a whole be,5
teacher:What would you do to convince us;student:Umm a brown,5
teacher:What would be what;student:If a light green was one third what would be a whole,5
teacher:One what would one be;student:If a light green was one third what would be a whole,5
teacher:Can you show us and prove it;student:Yep,5
teacher:If I call this two what would one look  like,5
teacher:Which rod would one be,5
teacher:And tell me about it;student:Yeah,5
teacher:What was the problem,5
teacher:And what is it do you remember;student:Yeah,5
teacher:How could you be so sure;student:Yes,5
teacher:How could you be so sure;student:Because we all ready checked,5
teacher:If you were building towers of 6 how many  would there be,5
teacher:Times what by 2;student:You just times them by 2 and then,5
teacher:Okay Milin can you show us in the middle here what you  just did with that one tower;student:You could put a red instead of the  blue,5
teacher:Where is that;student:But I made that,5
teacher:And whats different about the way you did it Michelle;student:I all ready figured it out with this,5
teacher:What do you have there,5
teacher:In what way;student:You have the same pattern same pattern,5
teacher:But I want to save all those  intermediate steps because if you had to go to to build  towers of 80 lets see when you had to build towers of 2 of  2 how many times of 3 high how many times did you  multiply by 2,5
teacher:When you had to build towers of 3 how many times did you  need to multiply by 2;student:You should really multiply by 8,5
teacher:Then you multiply by 2 again,5
teacher:So how many times did you multiply  by 2,5
teacher:Can you figure out what this student was doing,5
teacher:Can you figure out what this student was doing,5
teacher:Okay so when you and your partner are ready could you and your partner go ahead and share what you think is going on in this illustration,5
teacher:What do you think about this one;student:So 3,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Okay so how do you think this person created this;student:For every like 3 candies that she that Valerie has Cindy would only get 1,5
teacher:What do you think they were thinking,5
teacher:Andrew what do you think,5
teacher:Can you figure out what this person was thinking,5
teacher:Suppose you didnt know towers of 6 were 64 and towers of  7 were what did you say that was,5
teacher:In other words if 8  didnt work do you understand my my challenge to you,5
teacher:If I plugged in 8 or 9;student:This pattern works here,5
teacher:To 9 to 8;student:Which gave you to 8,5
teacher:How about you Steph,5
teacher:In what way;student:Well yes,5
teacher:Anything else;student:BRR Or RBR Or RRB,5
teacher:Okay now so what youve done so  far is,5
teacher:Okay now what are you doing Stephanie;student:In that case,5
teacher:How many if youre making towers of 4;student:Yes,5
teacher:And so thats for towers of;student:246810121416,5
teacher:If I call the orange rod one what number name  would I give to the white rod,5
teacher:You think  12 or 16 Michelle,5
teacher:Okay how many in 10;student:Like you from now we  know how to just oh you could give us a problem like how  many in 10 and wed know,5
teacher:Try to convince him;student:Dont try to convince me,5
teacher:What did you find then;student:You have to figure out whats in between that,5
teacher:What do you mean,5
teacher:Show me a little bit;student:In between okay,5
teacher:Now when would this work,5
teacher:It gave you 512 which was,5
teacher:Now now you made towers of 5 in  class and what did you get,5
teacher:And and how would you how would you convince me;student:Ten wholes or ten,5
teacher:If we call the white rod one what number name would we give to  the orange;student:If the white one was one whole what would um the orange be,5
teacher:Umm can you  prove it,5
teacher:And what number name are you calling the white;student:And the  red is one bigger the light green is one bigger,5
teacher:you called the green one and your calling the white one;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Is how much,5
teacher:One half is how much bigger than one third,5
teacher:Is it one or one sixth;student:Um one one sixth,5
teacher:And the question  was what number name do you give to the red,5
teacher:Well how can you build a model and say that one half is bigger than  a third by a sixth and build another model that says one half is bigger  than a third by a third;student:Well we and we um named well three reds equal up to um one  greens and then you put the purple next to it and you need one more  red you need a red to go next to the purple so it would be one third,5
teacher:How is that possible,5
teacher:Can anyone tell  me what s going on here,5
teacher:Danielle what do you think;student:There is enough to fit another light  green in here,5
teacher:What can you do to convince me that that s not  true,5
teacher:What do you think;student:Oh,5
teacher:What would you do to convince me,5
teacher:You  want to come up here and convince me Jackie on the overhead,5
teacher:And how would you convince me Jessica,5
teacher:But what number name did you give to white,5
teacher:Well show me your argument now and tell me which is bigger a half  and a third and by how much;student:Yeah and we think light green is a half,5
teacher:Okay you think a half is bigger than one third and you re calling the  dark green one;student:Okay we think that a half is bigger than the third,5
teacher:Ok then use the okay if your calling dark green one then I want to  hear your argument which is bigger a half or a third and by how  much;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Do  you think you can convince Dr Davis that that s the case,5
teacher:Can you convince Dr Davis that one half is bigger than  one third,5
teacher:By the way do you know how much bigger,5
teacher:Jessica  maybe and Laura can come up to the overhead and show Dr Davis  how you decided which is bigger,5
teacher:And see if you can convince us of  your result,5
teacher:Can you tell me what number name you re calling the orange and the  red rod;student:And,5
teacher:What do the rest of you think;student:One half,5
teacher:So if I call the blue rod one what number name would I give to light  green everybody;student:Because you could if you have you have three of these you could  put it up to the blue and it s one whole,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Ok you re saying it s a red rod bigger or two white ones but that s  what I see you have built there but I would like you to tell me what  number name you have for how much bigger it is;student:It s a red bigger but,5
teacher:What s wrong with that,5
teacher:In what way it is not fair,5
teacher:Ok so what do you ladies think;student:and this is bigger than,5
teacher:What are calling the candy bar when you started the  problem,5
teacher:What was one,5
teacher:What did you call one if you re thinking of  candy bars when you began the problem,5
teacher:Ok did you figure out  how much bigger,5
teacher:One half or one third,5
teacher:Now notice if I called  the dark green rod one what number name would I give to the red,5
teacher:Which one;student:Well no I mean if you take if  you take a blue rod and you could call it one whole then you would  take a diff a smaller rod and that would be something,5
teacher:What would I have to call one in order to name  the white rod one half,5
teacher:What would I have to call one if I  want to call the white rod one half,5
teacher:And what would you do to convince me,5
teacher:What would you  do Graham to convince me,5
teacher:Make up a problem for me,5
teacher:At your table with your partner  make up a problem for me and the rest of the class,5
teacher:Make up a problem,5
teacher:This would be an interesting problem what would you ask  me here Alan;student:What makes,5
teacher:Alan you want to come up here  and ask us and build it again,5
teacher:If the red rod was one fifth what would we call one;student:Me,5
teacher:Can you prove it;student:The orange rod,5
teacher:Okay what do you think;student:Five red ones make up an orange rod,5
teacher:If I call the red one one fifth what would I call the  orange,5
teacher:Okay Beth says that if she calls the  green rod one what would what number name the light green rod  one,5
teacher:Mark says that if we call the light  green rod one what number name will we give to blue,5
teacher:What would I have to call one if I make the  white rod one half,5
teacher:Now I m  gonna call the red rod one what number name would I give to the  brown rod,5
teacher:Now I want to call the red rod  one what number name would I give to the brown rod,5
teacher:And what would  you do to convince me,5
teacher:How is that possible for both of these to be a third,5
teacher:Which is the longest rod;student:I put the tallest then the  second to tallest third,5
teacher:And then tell me what to do;student:Mmmhmm,5
teacher:Now you remember when we said if we re calling the dark green  one what number name were we giving to red,5
teacher:And  we said that you told me this is a third is that possible or is it not  possible can you try to convince me that it s not possible for the  red one to have the number name one,5
teacher:What is the difference Erik;student:Not now,5
teacher:Michael what do you think;student:But if you are  comparing it to something bigger though,5
teacher:What am I going to call it;student:No oh yeah,5
teacher:Okay suppose I said I wanted the red to be one what would that  tell you about the dark green;student:Well red can t be a whole red can t be one because the green is  bigger and it takes three of the reds to make one green,5
teacher:Okay we re starting again what  number name would I have to give to green if I wanted red to be  one,5
teacher:Okay suppose I want the red to be one what number name would I  have to give dark green for red to be one;student:But the dark green is bigger then that,5
teacher:Ah let s see who wants to give me an answer,5
teacher:Only  this table wants to give me an answer,5
teacher:If I  call brown one what number name would I give to red,5
teacher:If I call brown one what number name  would I give to red,5
teacher:If I call brown red what number name would I brown one  what number name would I give to red,5
teacher:If I wanted to make it so the red  were one what would I have to make the dark green to make the  red one,5
teacher:What do you think it is;student:Um there s a smaller one,5
teacher:You want to come up and build it  really quickly,5
teacher:Ok but tell us what youre showing;student:Yeah,5
teacher:So how would I set this one out where I had a ratio of eight to three,5
teacher:Which method do you like best,5
teacher:Which method would you prefer the seven shares one share which I might add is basically what you call a unitary method because you go down to one and then back up to two and five,5
teacher:Do you prefer the unitary method or the fraction method,5
teacher:No;student:Was it Daniel was it you I was asking,5
teacher:And the three share would be,5
teacher:Its ratio would be,5
teacher:So how many lots do you have,5
teacher:So whats in one lot;student:Four,5
teacher:How did you work that out;student:Thirtyfour,5
teacher:How many;student:My prediction is 12,5
teacher:So when youve opened your packet count how many of each color you are and write that in the frequency column because frequency means,5
teacher:Well how many blues have you got,5
teacher:How many;student:Okay now you can  Miss,5
teacher:How would I work out the percentage of blue,5
teacher:Sixty and so what is the second share worth;student:Sixty,5
teacher:How would I work out this fraction,5
teacher:You found 30 and multiplied by two and got,5
teacher:How much does each man get,5
teacher:But that how is that going to make a story;student:Because you might only like a certain color,5
teacher:How is that going to make a story that says divide 210 Smarties into the ratio two to five,5
teacher:How many people have you actually got here,5
teacher:Only person A who gets two shares and person B who gets,5
teacher:How many did he have,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:Who would be the amateur who do you think,5
teacher:A or B,5
teacher:A would be the amateur and they get how many boards would they have got;student:A,5
teacher:So two boxes would be,5
teacher:Now 23 thirds how many wholes is that;student:Yeah,5
teacher:How many went to market,5
teacher:Yeah so thats a good story but wheres the actual question if you were going to make it into a question for someone to do,5
teacher:Well you lets just go with what youve got then eh;student:either,5
teacher:If Emma has one blue candle and Laura has four whats the ratio of candles,5
teacher:Anybody else got a good story,5
teacher:How many did you have Sally,5
teacher:How many did you have Jessica,5
teacher:How many,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:Where would you get the minus,5
teacher:How;student:So Im going to raise it by two,5
teacher:How are you going to do it without a calculator,5
teacher:What is this form called,5
teacher:How is it called,5
teacher:Which is equal;student:So its two divided by two that is one squared and that is equal,5
teacher:What do we have to do there Martina,5
teacher:So how much is the cube of two Petra;student:Sixteen,5
teacher:Eight so on the left side the answer is 16 and on the right side;student:The cube of two is eight,5
teacher:Twelve so;student:And three by two squared is 12,5
teacher:So what did you get on the left side;student:So two squared plus two cubed is equal to three by two squared,5
teacher:Which is;student:Which is 12 and that is smaller than two times two cubed because its like two times eight 16,5
teacher:The sum of numbers three and five well convert into words how,5
teacher:Come up here and write it down,5
teacher:Somebody has the answer,5
teacher:Calculate how far we can climb when were going to stand on the top of the easel,5
teacher:Okay what is next,5
teacher:So what have you got;student:What if you have zero,5
teacher:Do you know how to work this out;student:Good choice,5
teacher:Did you when you add them up make it six repeater and three repeater or just six and three;student:Ive got 21 six seven,5
teacher:So please Marcela find out the perimeter of the rhombus,5
teacher:What is the perimeter of this rhombus,5
teacher:So Marcela explain,5
teacher:Marcela what kind of shape is it,5
teacher:So you actually have,5
teacher:The attribute of the diagonals youve explained one point is discovered is there any other,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:Is it rounded to something;student:Six point six point eight,5
teacher:What did the calculator show you,5
teacher:Good of what;student:Its six point nine,5
teacher:So Marcela what else,5
teacher:So what kind of adjustment did you make,5
teacher:So by doing this we calculated what,5
teacher:So when you substitute;student:A is equal to the second root of 12 divided by two and square the whole formula plus seven divided by two and square the second formula,5
teacher:What do you have to do;student:I was just doing,5
teacher:So what are you dividing,5
teacher:So four to six would be,5
teacher:And the high score;student:Thirtysix,5
teacher:So we are going to break that scale and where do you think youd start it,5
teacher:So you start What what range are you looking at,5
teacher:Whats the range that youre going to show on your scale;student:Um,5
teacher:Twentyone so you are going from 21 up to;student:Twentyone,5
teacher:Now what range are you going to use,5
teacher:So what what scale did you use;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Where did you start,5
teacher:Did you start at 22;student:On this,5
teacher:What is this point here,5
teacher:This point here,5
teacher:What was that point there,5
teacher:This one,5
teacher:And the last;student:Thirtysix,5
teacher:Well what is the range;student:If you just told them the range wouldnt they be able to figure out the other values,5
teacher:Upper quartile;student:Twentyeight point five,5
teacher:Median;student:Twentyfive,5
teacher:Lower quartile;student:Twentytwo,5
teacher:Michael low score,5
teacher:So numbers one through to;student:Seven,5
teacher:And from;student:Seven,5
teacher:Okay Tam howd you calculate the mean;student:Seven,5
teacher:Okay the median the middle score which is the one we were talking about Alissa what was the seventh score,5
teacher:Who used the cumulative frequency column to find it;student:Um 28,5
teacher:The av average of 28 and 29,5
teacher:What is the mode,5
teacher:High score minus low score so what is the range;student:Oh no I think I missed that one,5
teacher:Okay and what is that;student:The one with the highest frequency,5
teacher:So how many pieces are there,5
teacher:Well how many pieces of data did I have all together;student:What do you mean,5
teacher:How many pieces of data;student:Oh 22,5
teacher:So how many on each side,5
teacher:One to seven so what is the midpoint there;student:So you do one through seven,5
teacher:So how many pieces of data do I now have on the righthand side;student:Yeah,5
teacher:And the lower quartile is going to be the,5
teacher:The five number summary what is the five number summary Tam,5
teacher:The difference between numbers four and minus eight,5
teacher:Now how is that going to help them determine what the fivepoint summary is,5
teacher:And just before we go on there How many chocolate chips do you think you would need to ensure that you ended up with three,5
teacher:How many blocks required,5
teacher:How would you find 30,5
teacher:Twentyone divided by,5
teacher:So two boxes 60 five boxes 150 so the first person gets,5
teacher:So the first person 60 and the second person gets,5
teacher:You cant give me one number for an answer if youre going to give me a ratio because youve gotta give me,5
teacher:So what you really wanted to say to me was,5
teacher:So what would the ratio eight to three be;student:Yes,5
teacher:Eight to three would equal;student:Eighteen,5
teacher:So what numbers am I actually speaking of,5
teacher:They are easily divisible by the,5
teacher:Eight and three is 11 and 11 goes into,5
teacher:One and three make,5
teacher:Well whats one box,5
teacher:So youve got 10 boxes so how much is in one box,5
teacher:Which was,5
teacher:So you have,5
teacher:What if I want to divide money up,5
teacher:Left hand side and three empty boxes on your right hand side which means you have used;student:Left,5
teacher:At least;student:At least 40,5
teacher:So where are you getting these figures from;student:About 30,5
teacher:And you were looking at ensuring that every cookie had three chocolate chips in it,5
teacher:So that means that youre going to separate them into two groups on your table with how many in the first group,5
teacher:What if I say I want them divided into ratio one to two,5
teacher:Six in each would be,5
teacher:Six to six which would be;student:Fourteen,5
teacher:Where have you indicated the exact value of that point,5
teacher:Which group,5
teacher:How many blocks have you got,5
teacher:What about the ratio two to five,5
teacher:That means on your left hand you would have,5
teacher:Two blocks which are empty boxes and on your right hand youve got;student:Two,5
teacher:Five which means that you have used for a ratio of two to five you have used;student:Five,5
teacher:What about eight to three,5
teacher:If youve used eight to three you should have eight empty boxes on your,5
teacher:So I want how many piles altogether really,5
teacher:Fourteen so how many on each side;student:Um 14,5
teacher:The product means what Misa,5
teacher:So Andrea try the first one,5
teacher:Letter D,5
teacher:Good Paul and the answer is;student:Sixteen minus 25,5
teacher:Number three Paul,5
teacher:Number four,5
teacher:The problem in letter D,5
teacher:Two minus 21 equals negative,5
teacher:Fifteen minus 36 equals;student:Fifteen minus 36,5
teacher:Number two,5
teacher:Number three is,5
teacher:Fine and number four,5
teacher:Fifteen minus;student:Fifteen minus six,5
teacher:Letter F,5
teacher:The assignments in F are composed of,5
teacher:Problem number one,5
teacher:Minus 25 equals;student:One plus four minus 25,5
teacher:Number four is,5
teacher:Number two,5
teacher:Difference;student:Nine minus 10,5
teacher:And what is it;student:Fourteen times two,5
teacher:Write it on the board;student:Im done,5
teacher:Which one rather letter 1A tell me which calculating performance is it or what is the last calculation we must do in this problem,5
teacher:In number two what is the last calculating performance,5
teacher:What is the last calculating performance,5
teacher:Subtraction no addition and from what two numbers;student:Subtraction,5
teacher:What is the correct answer;student:Its incorrect,5
teacher:Okay and number four what is the last calculating performance,5
teacher:Multiplication good and what two numerators;student:Multiplication,5
teacher:Calculate whats in the parenthesis,5
teacher:What last two numbers will be calculated,5
teacher:Next number two,5
teacher:Next number three,5
teacher:Number four,5
teacher:Number two,5
teacher:What is that,5
teacher:Number three is,5
teacher:Number three,5
teacher:How about the problems in letter G,5
teacher:Correct and do number two as well Jana;student:Ten minus 12 equals negative two,5
teacher:Positive one because its;student:Positive one,5
teacher:When we add up two A cubed plus three A cubed what did we call it on Friday,5
teacher:What is A cubed,5
teacher:What is A cubed;student:Cubed,5
teacher:How do I imagine it,5
teacher:We have X cubed which is once again a volume of a cube but we also have Y squared which is not a volume of a cube but its what,5
teacher:So Jana what can we sum up,5
teacher:This is five cubed plus three cubed equals;student:I cant figure it out,5
teacher:Eight cubed so its eight;student:Eight,5
teacher:I think Martin we should start with;student:Well plus three X squared well subtract it from negative two,5
teacher:Calculate three X squared,5
teacher:Yes thats two X squared and what else,5
teacher:Good six X squared minus;student:Six X squared,5
teacher:Its zero times A to the fifth power which is,5
teacher:Yes because zero times A squared is;student:If it says zero A squared is that zero,5
teacher:The fifth power and the last one Paul;student:The fifth power,5
teacher:Negative one because its what power;student:Negative one,5
teacher:Next problem,5
teacher:Next calculation,5
teacher:Yes and Paul will try number three;student:Seven times four equals 28,5
teacher:Martin is helping him out so why dont you tell us since you know it;student:Sixtyfive minus three is,5
teacher:How about number four,5
teacher:Ten minus youre already doing the next one in that case go ahead Denisa give it a try;student:Ten minus 36,5
teacher:Why dont you try the first one Paul,5
teacher:Jarka will try the next one,5
teacher:Lubo will try number three,5
teacher:Write it up on the board,5
teacher:How about B,5
teacher:How about D,5
teacher:The first one is,5
teacher:Everyone else should be quiet Lukas will tell us,5
teacher:And the second to last problem,5
teacher:And the last one is;student:To the nearest thousandths,5
teacher:So the first one is Paul,5
teacher:Number two,5
teacher:Negative four Nicole;student:Negative four to the third power as a whole number,5
teacher:Go up to do the problem,5
teacher:And how did you calculate it,5
teacher:What power is it,5
teacher:One whole number has how many eighths,5
teacher:So its minus thirtytwo eighths plus five eighths is;student:Is thirtytwo,5
teacher:Thirtytwo without five;student:Minus 28,5
teacher:Perimeter of what;student:Perimeter,5
teacher:What are we trying to figure out;student:The area,5
teacher:If were looking for the perimeter then the symbol will be;student:The perimeter,5
teacher:And you know,5
teacher:What do you have to see here;student:A to the second power times B,5
teacher:And this side,5
teacher:We add A plus B and multiply yes so,5
teacher:Do you have an idea,5
teacher:Where;student:You somehow draw a square,5
teacher:This drawing which John outlined corresponds to what,5
teacher:What does this correspond to,5
teacher:To what,5
teacher:One whole number has how many eighths,5
teacher:How many eighths is it,5
teacher:So how many eighths,5
teacher:How many eighths,5
teacher:So how do we do it that we have the same process as always;student:Five minus three in the parenthesis to the fourth power,5
teacher:So if were going to calculate it what do we have to do first,5
teacher:So what kind of calculating am I starting with in this word expression,5
teacher:So what are we going to start with;student:The difference of fourth powers of numbers five and three,5
teacher:First we should calculate what,5
teacher:So if we want to calculate it first we start with what;student:Five multiplied by the sum of the numbers 12 and three,5
teacher:And now well read the last one so you have something to compare it to Pepo what is going to be the last one;student:The square root of the sum of 11 and seven,5
teacher:What is this,5
teacher:And the answer is;student:The difference of numbers 15 and nine is 15 minus nine is six,5
teacher:So what is the answer;student:Two times 15 plus nine in parenthesis plus two times 15 plus nine in parenthesis,5
teacher:Are the parenthesis necessary there or we can get by without them;student:Fortyeight,5
teacher:So tell me what you have there;student:If I look at the answer it doesnt matter but its written differently,5
teacher:So its this way or what kind of different version did you want;student:Fifteen plus nine in parenthesis by two,5
teacher:How do we explain that the answer has to be the same no matter what way we write it down,5
teacher:Petro there is the quotient of five and eight do you have it there,5
teacher:So Stepanko minus four point zero is what,5
teacher:So what comes first;student:Fifteen plus two times nine is 33,5
teacher:And quotient,5
teacher:And what does this blue segment in the circumference mean,5
teacher:With what;student:I would try to divide it into four segments,5
teacher:You dont know the number of Pi,5
teacher:Why dont you choose the numbers;student:I know,5
teacher:Multiply it and,5
teacher:And how about problem E,5
teacher:Why dont you fix it;student:You have  that should have been nine point one hundred and six thousandths,5
teacher:Go up Jana and correct it,5
teacher:Go up there and try to calculate it,5
teacher:Calculate the diameter and radius,5
teacher:What kind of product or creation is it,5
teacher:Give us an example of a powered number,5
teacher:At what power,5
teacher:What is the number five what do we call the number five if five,5
teacher:So number five is the foundation of a power and the number two is youve already mentioned it here,5
teacher:May we use or can you give us an example of one other than the second power,5
teacher:What power is that,5
teacher:How should I write it up;student:Half,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:So where is the letter A going to be,5
teacher:But from this reasoning weve found out that the K will be located where,5
teacher:Through center S and then what once you divide it up;student:Through center S,5
teacher:Then the diameter is by what,5
teacher:The diameter in the square is by what,5
teacher:The diameter in the square is,5
teacher:And what ever comes out of that is what,5
teacher:What is the length of one side,5
teacher:So how would you define it more precisely,5
teacher:Which more accurate method should I use,5
teacher:Which one;student:Dodecagon octagon,5
teacher:is arriving to one thing that the perimeter of a square has four diameters the perimeter of a hexagon Philip,5
teacher:Six of what;student:Six,5
teacher:And if you recall you can see it from this picture diameter and radius are in what condition,5
teacher:Diameter and radius,5
teacher:And the two times R is,5
teacher:Note the length of the circumference depends on what do you think it depends on,5
teacher:Do you also remember the equation of that,5
teacher:What else,5
teacher:How many pieces of data all together,5
teacher:Well how many pieces of data are on each side;student:Could it be you get six and eight,5
teacher:What are we going to have to do,5
teacher:I don t mean for you to change  your model I mean is there any other way that you could  show me what that difference looks like without using the  whites,5
teacher:Or this difference here,5
teacher:What would that be;student:You could use a light green,5
teacher:And what did you say it was over here with the little  one,5
teacher:And if you used the whites,5
teacher:What about for this one,5
teacher:But you have had two two different names for the answer if  you did it this way it was;student:That would be one sixth that would be one sixth and that  one would be one sixth,5
teacher:And and uh Gregory for this one over here where she had  the three what was the name for that one;student:It was two twelfths,5
teacher:Alright so tell me which is bigger,5
teacher:How many of you are  convinced you know how much bigger and no one can  persuade you otherwise that two thirds is not only bigger than  a half but it is how much bigger,5
teacher:By the way what was one in that model,5
teacher:What did you call one in that model,5
teacher:Oh but youre saying that youre saying that two thirds  whats a third;student:So they cant  use those whites to show it,5
teacher:And what s two thirds;student:A third is the purple,5
teacher:Just tell us,5
teacher:Oh so what do you think;student:It was bigger by one sixth,5
teacher:And what did you get to be  one half,5
teacher:And your original one was;student:One two three four five six seven eight nine  ten eleven twelve,5
teacher:Over here it was how much;student:One two three,5
teacher:How much;student:Two thirds is still bigger,5
teacher:Two thirds is bigger but now I want to know by how  much,5
teacher:Uh how many more do you think you need,5
teacher:How many do you think,5
teacher:So how much larger,5
teacher:My goodness tell me help me remember what it was over  there,5
teacher:This  is different from the other one or the same,5
teacher:How s it different and how s it the same;student:It s different in a way and it s the same in a way,5
teacher:Is two thirds still  bigger Greg is two thirds still bigger than a half on this  model too or did it change,5
teacher:Ok Danielle what do you think about this time,5
teacher:What is two thirds;student:Well um two thirds,5
teacher:Can you build a two thirds and a one half  for him separate so we can then compare,5
teacher:What s the difference;student:Here s the two thirds and here s the half,5
teacher:Oh so is he getting a different answer from that too or are  they the same;student:It s um it s bigger by two twelfths,5
teacher:How are the answers I don t understand  what do you think about this,5
teacher:And this one;student:This one was bigger by three eighteenths,5
teacher:By how much;student:Yes,5
teacher:Tell us Meredith;student:No,5
teacher:And what rod did you use to  represent one sixth,5
teacher:Brian what do you think,5
teacher:Okay so if we are going to call this    ten  and the number name for this  would be;student:So its like switched around,5
teacher:Okay this piece here this  one piece here what are we going to call,5
teacher:The  one white rod,5
teacher:Okay but what so then what would the name  for one of them be;student:Well if this was one then that would be  ten but when its switched around this is  all  all ten all ten tenths when you put them on  here theyre like they would be like ten wholes  even though this would be considered   Well   if this is supposed to be ten you put  then of these up then these would be ten  wholes,5
teacher:I asked you what you would call this,5
teacher:Okay now let me just hear what these ladies  over here have come up with,5
teacher:Let  me just  What did you come up with,5
teacher:So  what would this be,5
teacher:Okay and if Im calling  the orange  ten  youre calling the white the  number name,5
teacher:How about the yellow rod,5
teacher:What number name will we give  it,5
teacher:What number would I give to one  white rod if were still calling the orange the  number name  fifty,5
teacher:How did you come up  with it so quickly,5
teacher:What made you think  of fives,5
teacher:Okay let me talk to  a couple of other people then well get  somebody to come up and tell us about this,5
teacher:Okay what do  we think over here you two,5
teacher:How can that be,5
teacher:Audra explain what you just said,5
teacher:What color rod,5
teacher:And what did you get Meredith,5
teacher:And two white rods would be,5
teacher:And one red would be,5
teacher:And youre calling two whites;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Does that contradict  what youre doing,5
teacher:Or does it still work what youre doing,5
teacher:Is it still the same or does it change  when your model changes,5
teacher:What is different about  each of those models,5
teacher:What number name would  I give to two of the whites,5
teacher:Two white rods,5
teacher:Yeah Im calling the orange one what  number name would I give to two whites;student:Thats a red rod,5
teacher:What are you  going to call the two white rods,5
teacher:Ok How did you come up with one  fifth,5
teacher:Would you like to come up and show  us,5
teacher:Ok explain a little further to me,5
teacher:And then  what is alike about all of those models,5
teacher:And what we supposed to figure out after we did that;student:Well we ve got we ve got that whole this is the whole we  have the three thirds and we then the half,5
teacher:By how much;student:Like up here  there s one half right there and there s the thirds there s the  second third,5
teacher:By the way which is bigger;student:Two after the other can be third,5
teacher:Im kind of  curious what do you imagine that you dont have there  Jessica,5
teacher:And youre imagining the whites and how many do you  imagine are there;student:Well I imagine the white ones,5
teacher:And how many do you have there Andrew,5
teacher:And can you see on the overhead  how many whites those of you who dont have enough,5
teacher:But you  built it too Amy how many do you have Amy,5
teacher:That hes now going to give the white one the number  name what class,5
teacher:Now how does that help you solve the  problem what is the difference between two thirds and three  quarters gentlemen who are up there,5
teacher:So;student:Um that but two reds equal up to a purple,5
teacher:But thats an  interesting thought that there is another way and when you  think about all those purples there what number name  would you give to a purple then,5
teacher:Yeah but I could ask you a question which is bigger a sixth  or three quarters;student:Then you could do it,5
teacher:Andrew what do you think;student:Right it would either take one,5
teacher:Andrew and Jessica what do  you think,5
teacher:Now youre telling me that you used browns two browns  to be;student:Well I made a  model that had the white was one fortyeighth and the  purples were twelfths and the white was I mean the red was  twentyfourths and I took two browns as the thirds and two  dark greens as the fourths and they I called them the fourths  and then the whole was four oranges and two purples,5
teacher:But maybe um you want to  come up here and do that,5
teacher:Why dont you build that  right here,5
teacher:Ok why dont the rest of you sit down and lets have Erik  and Alan make that model;student:We made the  same model that was I think it was two oranges and like  one purple yeah it was two oranges and one purple and  then it had the thirds,5
teacher:What would that white one be called;student:I think um,5
teacher:So then what would one  white one be called in that next model do you think,5
teacher:What would be what would be twentyfourths;student:No no it would take twenty four ones to equal a whole,5
teacher:Uh can you show us how that shows three quarters and two  thirds,5
teacher:Ok Can you  build one for three quarters and two thirds,5
teacher:Does someone  have any other suggestions,5
teacher:Anybody else remember how you did  that,5
teacher:How about here,5
teacher:Ok you want to tell the class about what you have  there,5
teacher:Whats one twelfth,5
teacher:Well whats the difference;student:Cuz what we did really to figure it out,5
teacher:Jessica says she thinks  theres a model that you can build thats smaller now when  I use the word smaller you use the word smaller what do  you think we mean,5
teacher:Ok so what what we called one in this problem was what  what did we call one;student:Smaller by size,5
teacher:So youre telling me the six models that you made;student:And so you cant possibly make one smaller  because you wont be able to fit it wont work because  every one you make equals up equals up to the orange and  red,5
teacher:How would you convince me,5
teacher:Can you predict something about the one that would be  next smallest;student:Next sma,5
teacher:Brian whats your prediction,5
teacher:You think what would be twentyfourths;student:I think it would be twentyfour,5
teacher:What rods,5
teacher:What do you think Erik,5
teacher:Let me hear  what some other people are saying,5
teacher:Can you show us;student:The difference is one twelfth,5
teacher:I guess my question is what you called one in each of these  models;student:And,5
teacher:What would you expect if you were really  worrying about the size you had two children at a dock and  you have a boat and you have a fish now we re not going to  go with sea monsters,5
teacher:But now what would be the same about all of your models;student:No,5
teacher:What wouldnt change about all of your models Beth,5
teacher:And whats that idea that would be the same;student:Wed have the same idea,5
teacher:What size will  you make them will that necessarily be the same,5
teacher:What  does that have to say about it,5
teacher:What  would probably happen if you did that,5
teacher:And what  would happen Meredith,5
teacher:So tell me what you re thinking,5
teacher:In what way is it the same or different;student:Yeah,5
teacher:What do you think the question is,5
teacher:What do you think the question is,5
teacher:Now before you model it you  might think in your head before you begin to model it what  you is bigger and if so if one is bigger by how much,5
teacher:Why  don t you work with your partner and see if you can figure it  out,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:What would you expect to be the largest object and the  next and the next,5
teacher:What about the boat and the children,5
teacher:What did you think,5
teacher:Does anyone remember anything in our  discussion about models,5
teacher:What do you mean by that basically its doubled Alan;student:Thats,5
teacher:In what way is it doubled,5
teacher:Now how does this get doubled to be this,5
teacher:But how did the red get doubled,5
teacher:Im confused how did the red get doubled here;student:The red,5
teacher:From one orange to two oranges I dont  know how did the red get doubled,5
teacher:Ok so this model is doubled  of this now you have to convince me that this model is  double of this so instead of two oranges and a purple what  should we have now if its doubled,5
teacher:Hold on a  minute Jessica I think were having a little discussion  about uh solutions there Ok can you nice and loud for the  people back there show them what youre doing,5
teacher:What  would you expect we would have then if its doubled,5
teacher:Ok what would my one look like in terms of rods;student:If you were gonna make another model what um the  doubles be,5
teacher:What would I call one;student:Um fortyeight,5
teacher:Imagine in your head what I would  call one,5
teacher:I dont know Im asking you thats my question Andrew  what do you think;student:But no,5
teacher:Remember what I  asked you to think about,5
teacher:Does anyone remember Andrew,5
teacher:Does anyone else remember anything in our discussion about  models;student:Um is onehalf bigger uh is one half bigger than one fourth  by how much,5
teacher:If I were to make another  model Andrews hand is up Andrew knows my question  what do you think my question is Andrew,5
teacher:What do you think;student:I think it is five because cause five times ten  equals fifty,5
teacher:How did  you think of it so quickly,5
teacher:What made you think  of five so quickly,5
teacher:So what stage have they drawn your triangle without you having to add on the rest of the instructions,5
teacher:So did you decide that that was important or the length of the line was important;student:And I sort of bisected,5
teacher:Well did you end up working out how many instructions you actually needed for each one;student:Yeah,5
teacher:You needed four what were they;student:Yep I needed four,5
teacher:Did you what was the arc on angle C,5
teacher:Show me,5
teacher:Right did you actually have to have so did you tell them what length that was,5
teacher:What did you need,5
teacher:And what was it;student:Three,5
teacher:Its well how long was the base did you say,5
teacher:So how did you end up;student:Okay,5
teacher:What did you end up having to write,5
teacher:What did you end up having to draw;student:Construct a right angle,5
teacher:Yes but what were the instructions;student:Congruent triangles theyre all congruent,5
teacher:Of what size,5
teacher:Is it going to be all sides is it going to be all angles what is it going to be,5
teacher:So F equals A and whats equal to C;student:Like F equals A,5
teacher:Whats the same;student:Because that tells  the same,5
teacher:Triangle to triangle what;student:Oh F E D,5
teacher:Um what did you do there,5
teacher:Okay but just think about when you say it does not change what doesnt it change from,5
teacher:In fact what would you really call it,5
teacher:Okay um were doing revision from yesterday on the congruent triangle so do you remember what a con what a pair of tria congruent triangles are,5
teacher:Same what;student:Two triangles that are the same,5
teacher:All right number one which angle is equal to angle A,5
teacher:Which angle is equal to angle D,5
teacher:So what did you end up doing;student:And join where the point,5
teacher:Number three if angle A is 30 and angle D is 60 uh what size is angle E,5
teacher:Which line is equal to B C,5
teacher:Which line is equal to B C;student:Im sorry,5
teacher:Number six which line is equal to E F,5
teacher:And okay if A C if A B is five all right and B C is three and A C is four centimeters all right how long is D F,5
teacher:Number eight how long is E F,5
teacher:Triangle A B C and triangle F E D And number 10 which is the hypotenuse of triangle A B C;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Okay who wants to answer them,5
teacher:And number four what size is angle D,5
teacher:Does the total go up perhaps as you add to the number of sides or what happens,5
teacher:Was it all the sides all the angles a combination;student:The edited version,5
teacher:Yep you end up with all the same angles but what did you tell them to draw sides or angles,5
teacher:So the first one what which one will it be,5
teacher:Howd you go with the revision at beginning of the lesson,5
teacher:Four cubed is,5
teacher:One quarter of 16,5
teacher:So three quarters;student:Four,5
teacher:What happened,5
teacher:Which one caused the difficulty,5
teacher:So what does four cubed mean,5
teacher:Now anyone got any ideas as to how many chocolate chips I would have to put into my mixture so that I would end up with at least three in each cookie,5
teacher:And sigma F will be;student:Yeah,5
teacher:When you have completed that fre uh cumulative frequency column what should you check,5
teacher:What is the median score,5
teacher:How many pieces of data do we have,5
teacher:Okay now think of it 14 pieces of data balanced how many on each side,5
teacher:Have we got any piece of data for the center;student:Seven,5
teacher:This one,5
teacher:This one is written as can you guess,5
teacher:You said Ive got a 90 degree angle what else are you going to tell me,5
teacher:What else are you going to tell me,5
teacher:Which lines;student:Um I said an angle of 60 degrees and then but and then two lines,5
teacher:From where;student:And draw a line six centimeters long,5
teacher:And what did you end up with Tanya,5
teacher:So which angles do you which angles did you give;student:But with um mine I gave the angles is that is that all right,5
teacher:Yeah so what did you start with;student:Oh sorry,5
teacher:So you really what was the minimum number of instructions,5
teacher:How did you go with yours,5
teacher:What did you end up with;student:Pardon,5
teacher:What did you end up with,5
teacher:What did you start with;student:I drew a triangle,5
teacher:So that ones three centimeters and how long is that one;student:I just I just said um draw a six centimeter line set your compass to three centimeters and draw an arc from each end and draw it,5
teacher:And what did you do;student:Used a ruler and protractor,5
teacher:Whats yours Justine,5
teacher:In every single one of those that worked where did you notice the angle was,5
teacher:And whats the other one Kate,5
teacher:Right youve got a 90 degree angle what are you going to define;student:Join the two ends,5
teacher:But what did you draw,5
teacher:Now because this fraction is a twothirds do you remember what I told you what numbers you should pick now,5
teacher:Now whats your conclusion,5
teacher:Now do you remember how to measure the angle,5
teacher:Ok while you are working on that Meredith David will show  me this;student:Ill do a seesaw,5
teacher:The whole thing what number name is that;student:This is what I did on Friday and the dark green will be the  whole thing and the light green with be the half,5
teacher:So then can I ask you which is bigger a half or a third;student:Because I have more support and you probably need it a little  wobbly to fall,5
teacher:And I am asking by how much,5
teacher:How much bigger is it,5
teacher:Can you use the rods to show me;student:Well its bigger by,5
teacher:How much bigger do you think  that half is than that third,5
teacher:If we had to give a number name for  for whats missing there,5
teacher:Rather than break one of these red ones in half  what else could we put there to make them the same length,5
teacher:Ok David what do you think now,5
teacher:Could we come up with a name for that,5
teacher:What  the difference is between the two,5
teacher:What would be a good number name for that,5
teacher:Or could we go back and figure out what the number name  would be for that;student:Um maybe,5
teacher:Remember this is how much of  the bar,5
teacher:Ok that is a good point is there another solution to this;student:It is not a perfect fit,5
teacher:Ok do you think you can write that up for me and trace your  rods and explain it;student:One sixth,5
teacher:Which is what number name,5
teacher:Which is how much;student:By uh by this,5
teacher:Brian lets hear what you have  here,5
teacher:Youre going to go with that;student:But I guess Ill just go with one fiftieth,5
teacher:Are fifty of what in there;student:Yeah and if there are fifty of them in there I  guess I just call it one fiftieth,5
teacher:Fifty of what kind  of what,5
teacher:So  when you go to compare them how do you do that,5
teacher:How much bigger is   by how  much,5
teacher:What number name  are we going to give to this,5
teacher:The question is can we come up with a  number name for the difference between a half and a third,5
teacher:You gave this a number  name of half and this one the number name of a third what  number name are you going to give to this little guy,5
teacher:Is there a way you could prove it,5
teacher:Well what number  name can we give this if we had to give it actual fraction names  well how did you find that this is a third and this is a half,5
teacher:What would we have   where would we have to place them in  order to know what the number name might be;student:Yeah,5
teacher:So what number name would we give to the white,5
teacher:What might you call the white rod,5
teacher:Ok so what is  the difference between a half and a third,5
teacher:By how much;student:A half is much larger than a third,5
teacher:And can we prove it,5
teacher:What about if you make it concave,5
teacher:Ok well I want you to think about this question again about  what we would call this difference between the two;student:Like 15 or something,5
teacher:Hold up one half and one third,5
teacher:How many sides has that got,5
teacher:Whats it called if it has six straight sides,5
teacher:The diagram up there has in the middle of it what sort of shape,5
teacher:So suppose I took that side what choice have I got about extending it,5
teacher:How many of those could you get from this hexagon,5
teacher:How do you actually construct that diagram,5
teacher:And then,5
teacher:Now what havent we explained yet,5
teacher:Anyone know what convex is,5
teacher:Anyone know theres a word thats the opposite of convex,5
teacher:Curved which way,5
teacher:The the other word that means the opposite of that also starts with that,5
teacher:Whats that sort of thing called that youve just written down,5
teacher:So how do we get rid of that one,5
teacher:What are we doing here oh,5
teacher:Can anyone help us with what a polygon might be,5
teacher:Were there any others,5
teacher:Some others words or phrases,5
teacher:Um where is that,5
teacher:Ok and Brian you worked on both of these two can you  explain this model to me;student:And this would be one of  the thirds,5
teacher:But my next question to both of you to think about because I  think you both really understand this is whats the difference  between those two;student:It goes up because this is larger,5
teacher:What would be the number difference  between those two between the half and the third,5
teacher:Two what;student:And then its a difference of two,5
teacher:What are we calling these ones,5
teacher:What would we call that;student:One sixth,5
teacher:What do you think David,5
teacher:Ok show me show me;student:This would be one half and this  would be one third and that would be one third,5
teacher:I heard one sixth and I heard two  sixts and I want to know before I go then what it is,5
teacher:What do you think David,5
teacher:So whats the difference here,5
teacher:Between the red and the green,5
teacher:Right but if now I took it away again then what would be the  number name for the difference,5
teacher:What is the number name for  that I forgot what are we calling the white block,5
teacher:What if the question is through that instead of asking you to  look at the whole candy bar then I am just asking you to  compare the amounts of a half and a third of the candy bar;student:So it has to be two sixths,5
teacher:Can someone give me a word or two that you need,5
teacher:And how much more;student:You sure would,5
teacher:Whats twothirds times zero;student:Okay,5
teacher:Plus eight is,5
teacher:Eight is;student:Plus eight is,5
teacher:Jeff how about yours;student:I want him to tell me,5
teacher:And I will tell you that there will be more than one number that might work here but remember that whatever number you put in the first box what do you have to do,5
teacher:What,5
teacher:So what do we know about six;student:Why don t you pass the paper down,5
teacher:Which list does six go in,5
teacher:Does work or doesn t work,5
teacher:Can somebody come and show that;student:Oh I don t want it to be right,5
teacher:Matt can you show that,5
teacher:And so this starts out by being what;student:Two and three work that works,5
teacher:How much is that,5
teacher:How much is that,5
teacher:And so when I say that s equal to zero is that true or false;student:Thank You,5
teacher:Okay so how about two,5
teacher:Do I put the two here or here,5
teacher:So it says nine minus fifteen how much is that,5
teacher:Yeah how about that;student:He thinks he is all funny now,5
teacher:That is negative six but we are not through then it says plus six how much is that;student:Negative six,5
teacher:Because what did he say he was going to do;student:He made it up,5
teacher:How much is that,5
teacher:Six plus what,5
teacher:Yeah can you make a legal substitution and get a true statement;student:Can you like take a legal substitution and have a true answer,5
teacher:Sure and so if I use this system of the truth set I can write a 4 here and what is that telling me,5
teacher:Hum Michael Michelle and Jeff you can guess,5
teacher:What s the other number;student:Sixtytwo one one one,5
teacher:Yeah Michelle what do you think would be another number that might work for that one;student:Bobby already yelled out the answer so it doesn t really matter,5
teacher:Michael what number do you think might work;student:Odds don t work right,5
teacher:Say the one secret yeah Jeff say the one secret that you know;student:No,5
teacher:What is the other number that works up here incidentally,5
teacher:I really would like Mike to say the secret,5
teacher:Who is about to say the secret;student:We got it together,5
teacher:Did anyone figure it out;student:Okay,5
teacher:What would be the numbers that might work,5
teacher:And one certainly divides seventeen and what other number might work;student:The seventeen is lower than the nineteen,5
teacher:What happens when you try those,5
teacher:Can somebody think of a way to multiply seventeen by seventeen,5
teacher:Okay so when we say that s equal to zero up there is it true or false;student:Zero,5
teacher:How about the second problem;student:Try three,5
teacher:Amy Lynn what did you get;student:It s five,5
teacher:Twelve eight,5
teacher:Anybody get any numbers for these missing ones,5
teacher:What s the second answer for eight;student:Yes,5
teacher:Is anybody prepared to tell me right away what number will work,5
teacher:Anybody else want to whisper the secret into the microphone;student:Well I m sort of sure that I know it but like I don t want to make a fool of myself because if I am wrong,5
teacher:What s this,5
teacher:What s this;student:We know that,5
teacher:What s this,5
teacher:What good is a secret that doesn t work;student:It doesn t work,5
teacher:Okay let s let s get rid of some of these which are the ones we are sure doesn t work;student:Hold on,5
teacher:Can anybody tell me right away,5
teacher:Will people try them,5
teacher:How much is that,5
teacher:How much;student:That s 30,5
teacher:How many do you know;student:I just know one,5
teacher:Thank you;student:Yeah right so it is number seven that we want,5
teacher:Hum anybody got anything for number six yet,5
teacher:Twelve equals zero and you got a number for that;student:Plus twelve,5
teacher:Minus thirty that much would be;student:Eight is six,5
teacher:How about that,5
teacher:Anybody get any numbers for number four;student:Let s look at the next page,5
teacher:Everybody come show us would you,5
teacher:So what have we got,5
teacher:We ve got sixteen minus how much is this,5
teacher:Fifteen times four,5
teacher:So what have we got;student:We should check it out,5
teacher:Okay is that legal or illegal,5
teacher:Yeah how much is that;student:I got a different number,5
teacher:Uh we need to figure out how much is sixteen minus sixty how much is that,5
teacher:When I say that is equal to zero is that true or false,5
teacher:Somebody got another number you would like to try;student:What are you laughing at,5
teacher:Four minus thirty how much is that;student:What are we on,5
teacher:How much is four minus thirty,5
teacher:So when we say four minus thirty plus twentysix equals zero is that true or false,5
teacher:And somebody was telling me a number for this one;student:Six times two,5
teacher:Is sixteen minus sixty,5
teacher:Six plus six equals eight true or false;student:But it was a false statement,5
teacher:Where do you want me to write the six,5
teacher:Now what I d like you to do is make a legal substitution that would produce a false statement,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Anybody else what do you think,5
teacher:Um to decide with the rods you have what was the smallest model  you can build,5
teacher:Ok you want to tell the class about  what you have there,5
teacher:Whats one twelfth,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Jessica says she thinks theres a model that you can build thats  smaller now when I use the word smaller you use the word  smaller what do you think we mean,5
teacher:What do you think Erik,5
teacher:Ok so what what we called one in this problem was what what  did we call one;student:Smaller by size,5
teacher:How do you know  that that that theres not one smaller,5
teacher:How would  you convince me,5
teacher:I would like one that uh is the next smallest;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Can you predict something about the one that would be next  smallest;student:Next sma,5
teacher:Brian whats your prediction,5
teacher:You think what would be twentyfourths;student:I think it would be twentyfour,5
teacher:Any thoughts,5
teacher:How  many do you think,5
teacher:Does anybody else have  any ideas about that,5
teacher:What can be such a secret;student:You could you could build a thing you could build fractions of  every single rod if you know what youre doing and you have a  strategy or a secret that that you know will work,5
teacher:Okay now the question I m going to ask you when you  work on this balance what would you have to have put there  to stop it from falling,5
teacher:What other what other rod could  have been put on the left side so that it wouldn t fall when  you took that off,5
teacher:What  did you take off,5
teacher:Is that correct and the  greens were on the other side or was it the other way,5
teacher:What would you have had to put on that other side so  it wouldn t tip once you took the two reds and the green off,5
teacher:What would you have guessed it should have been;student:Um let s see,5
teacher:Okay what number name would you give to white;student:Well  cause when I went like this I just saw there was one space in between and I  knew the white is that space,5
teacher:What rods,5
teacher:What number name  would white have had to have,5
teacher:You have any idea Meredith,5
teacher:What number  name would white have if green were one half and red were  one third,5
teacher:Does anybody have a clue what  number name white would have for the model that was built  here,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Um how many you think there are,5
teacher:How many models do  you think you can build,5
teacher:What do you mean one for every single rod tell me what you  mean by that;student:Um if you know what youre doing and you know what strategy  you could probably build you could probably build one for every  single rod,5
teacher:You have any idea,5
teacher:How many secrets do you know,5
teacher:What would be what would be twentyfourths;student:No no it would take twenty four ones to equal a whole,5
teacher:What would that white one be called;student:I think um,5
teacher:I dont know Im asking you thats my question Andrew what do  you think;student:But no,5
teacher:Tell me about that one,5
teacher:Thats an interesting theory could you kind of test that  one out for me and see see if you could build a bigger model,5
teacher:Tell me about that one,5
teacher:Thats an interesting theory could you kind of test that  one out for me and see see if you could build a bigger model,5
teacher:What happened;student:We had it we had it better yesterday,5
teacher:What do you thinks messing things up;student:Oh I see what s wrong,5
teacher:Tell me  about this model and tell me just what you told me before,5
teacher:What do you what do you guys think what do you  think happened,5
teacher:Graham do you want uh to tell us,5
teacher:Would you sketch it up here David,5
teacher:If I wrote three plus box equals five which do you suppose they would call it,5
teacher:TRUE or false or open,5
teacher:Hum could you tell me something that I could write in the box that would make a false statement Brian,5
teacher:Michael what would that be,5
teacher:Imagine in your head what I would call  one,5
teacher:What would I call one;student:Um fortyeight,5
teacher:Ok what would my one look like in terms of rods;student:If you were gonna make another model what um the doubles be,5
teacher:If I were to make another model  Andrews hand is up Andrew knows my question what do you  think my question is Andrew,5
teacher:Im  kind of curious what do you imagine that you dont have there  Jessica,5
teacher:And youre imagining the whites and how many do you imagine  are there;student:Well I imagine the white ones,5
teacher:And  how many do you have there Andrew,5
teacher:But you built it too Amy how many  do you have Amy,5
teacher:That hes now going to give the white one the number name what  class,5
teacher:Now how does that  help you solve the problem what is the difference between two  thirds and three quarters gentlemen who are up there,5
teacher:Now youre telling me that you used browns two browns to be;student:Well I made a model  that had the white was one fortyeighth and the purples were  twelfths and the white was I mean the red was twentyfourths and I  took two browns as the thirds and two dark greens as the fourths  and they I called them the fourths and then the whole was four  oranges and two purples,5
teacher:So then what would one white one  be called in that next model do you think,5
teacher:I guess my question is what you called one in each of these  models;student:And,5
teacher:In what way is it doubled,5
teacher:Now how does  this get doubled to be this,5
teacher:But how did the red get  doubled,5
teacher:Im confused how did the red get doubled here;student:The red,5
teacher:From one orange to two oranges I dont know how did the  red get doubled,5
teacher:Ok so this model is doubled of this now you have to  convince me that this model is double of this so instead of two  oranges and a purple what should we have now if its doubled,5
teacher:What would you expect we would have then if its  doubled,5
teacher:What do you mean by that basically its doubled Alan;student:Thats,5
teacher:So the question I m  asking you is if that s   one  what  would be the number name would you give to red,5
teacher:How many do you know;student:Two,5
teacher:Is that legal or illegal;student:No one three,5
teacher:How are they;student:Number three can be rolled twice,5
teacher:What are the two ways,5
teacher:And you know what which ways they could be rolled,5
teacher:You can tell me what they are,5
teacher:So nine can you tell me what nine is for example;student:Yeah,5
teacher:So so whats your theory then about this,5
teacher:But if you wanted to win would you would you want to be player A or player B;student:No matter what you do it s gonna be a game of luck,5
teacher:What are you saying;student:Jeff Rom,5
teacher:Shelly what were you saying makes a difference;student:It doesn t you guys can,5
teacher:What makes a difference;student:For what,5
teacher:Has something made a difference,5
teacher:About anything;student:About what,5
teacher:OK so tell me in what way that happened;student:I don t know,5
teacher:You want to tell,5
teacher:What made you change your mind;student:This is the new game this explains why,5
teacher:How is that;student:The number three can be rolled twice,5
teacher:OK did you have any explanation for why you changed your mind,5
teacher:Explain to me what this is,5
teacher:So why do you who has the advantage are you saying,5
teacher:Can you show me;student:Minus the seven for five and the plus six,5
teacher:Point,5
teacher:Anybody else have a secret you want to say to the camera;student:You got number six you got number six,5
teacher:OK is anybody problem six anybody got six;student:I m almost done,5
teacher:OK where is it that it goes by two can you show that;student:Then if when I do all that between one like the numbers in between it goes by two,5
teacher:Has anybody figured out the equation for six;student:Is there an answer for six,5
teacher:Has anybody figured out the equation for six,5
teacher:Can you think of a way to write that,5
teacher:How could you write that,5
teacher:What do you think;student:To help figure out why player B had an advantage,5
teacher:Can you tell me what these numbers mean over here;student:And player B Player B has the more commonly rolled numbers,5
teacher:Okay so two is rolled how many times;student:Four is rolled three times,5
teacher:Okay and three is rolled,5
teacher:And this is five is rolled,5
teacher:And six,5
teacher:OK tell me about this,5
teacher:Anybody else what did some of you else think at the beginning,5
teacher:What did you think,5
teacher:Which way did you think it was unfair though,5
teacher:What do you mean by that;student:Yes,5
teacher:Um anybody else what do you think,5
teacher:So do you do you want to come up here and tell me what the outcomes are for seven and what the outcomes are for eight,5
teacher:Um how many how many do you get that way Matt;student:You know and you have to put the one and then add one two three four five six and then it s two and then add one two three four five six and then add three one two three four five six and then so on,5
teacher:How do you get thirty six;student:Thirty six,5
teacher:Is there another way you can show that same idea;student:Three times three is,5
teacher:Is there another way of showing that same idea that Matt has;student:This weekend,5
teacher:Is there any there any other way you can show that;student:Did you do this,5
teacher:Can you come up and show us please Ankur;student:We put one and then put it a dash and then plus put one two three,5
teacher:You want to keep on going and show us the general pattern Ankur;student:Bill has no pupils,5
teacher:Want to say a little more;student:It s just like plain English,5
teacher:So what else,5
teacher:What else were you going to say Romina,5
teacher:What do the numbers on the sides represent,5
teacher:Let s take in the first column what do those numbers represent,5
teacher:What do you think about this game,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Any other theory or discussion,5
teacher:Romina what do you think;student:Check the chart out,5
teacher:Stepanie what did you think,5
teacher:Anybody else have any thoughts on that,5
teacher:Any ideas,5
teacher:Did you any any theory before you started playng,5
teacher:Did you have any ideas before you started,5
teacher:What about you Matt what do you think,5
teacher:Magda what did you think,5
teacher:You used the two here and the three here how did you find that,5
teacher:Before you started playing the game,5
teacher:Did you have any theories before you started,5
teacher:Now I wanna know you have a theory and now you think if you wanted to win the game who would you like to be,5
teacher:So now the question is now that you ve played the game and you thought about it a little bit more do you think you could give some insight into why we have an advantage and even more so what kind of an advantage B has,5
teacher:Can you give some insight into the advantage of B and even tell me a little bit more about the kind of advantage,5
teacher:Well three you can get how many ways,5
teacher:And what s that way,5
teacher:And she can get six by,5
teacher:Which was,5
teacher:OK now you have another number how did you find that other number;student:And then the seven we used it as a plus number,5
teacher:Who else has a secret you re ready to tell to the camera you re not going to tell the whole world but you re going to tell the camera,5
teacher:What s the secret;student:See if you take  these are a multiple of 10,5
teacher:OK say it,5
teacher:Yeah why don t you come and write that on the white board so everybody can see what you re doing;student:For number three the difference between one and four is three the difference between four and seven is three too and the difference between seven and ten is three so that is going to be the first number but on number 6 the difference between one and two is one and the difference between two and five is three so which one goes in the box,5
teacher:Do you want to do it,5
teacher:So um Jeff is going to tell you about this problem right here,5
teacher:See if you can you helped them get it can you come and explain it to the camera,5
teacher:OK Ankur says tell him a number and he ll tell you how it works;student:Someone pick a number that will go like here,5
teacher:Lets see if anybody can do number 7 then,5
teacher:Come say it for the camera here,5
teacher:So how would you write that with this box triangle notation;student:And 59,5
teacher:Can you write it for me;student:Box times Box  5  Triangle,5
teacher:Can you write that here;student:Equals triangle,5
teacher:With the boxes and triangles,5
teacher:OK are you going to explain it;student:Number nine,5
teacher:Where do you suppose those halves are coming from what do you suppose is making those halves appear in that problem,5
teacher:Now why don t you take that triangle number and divide it by the box number what do I get;student:So on the board like its square times square it s square times like when you divide twelve by four that number goes in the second place,5
teacher:Just say it,5
teacher:Do you want to show it to me,5
teacher:Do you want to come and show it to the camera,5
teacher:Do you remember what you said,5
teacher:Legal or illegal;student:Oh use some cheesy little,5
teacher:True or false,5
teacher:Who is going to come and explain one,5
teacher:Yeah Mike why don t you come up and explain one right up here and explain it,5
teacher:So now you want to say where you get the five from,5
teacher:Well now you want to say where you got the five from,5
teacher:You found out how to write it OK well come and show people;student:I think we found out how to write it,5
teacher:What do I get at that point,5
teacher:Yeah let s just show the camera huh let s just show the camera;student:Aw can we just show you,5
teacher:OK now you certainly managed to write it could you write it using the box and triangle method of writing;student:the number after the bracket is always one,5
teacher:See if you can do that,5
teacher:Yeah you want to go and do that;student:The box here and the box here,5
teacher:Can you write that with that box and triangle notation,5
teacher:See if you can,5
teacher:Do you want to come and write it and tell it to the camera,5
teacher:Michelle without saying what you and Ankur have done can you tell people what you said to me originally,5
teacher:And maybe you could explain it,5
teacher:Now if I put some number if I put some number in the box what do I have to do;student:Triangles,5
teacher:What answer;student:You get the answer,5
teacher:You tell me you get something why don t you say equals and tell me what you get;student:But then we have to put times something,5
teacher:What s the secret that you have for this,5
teacher:Yeah that s right e stands for energy do you know what the m stands for;student:Energy equals,5
teacher:What does the m stand for;student:M c squared,5
teacher:Um okay now there was really a sort of neat thing that happened last time oh what were we working on,5
teacher:What were we taught to do,5
teacher:Do you remember what you were trying to find some numbers what did those numbers do,5
teacher:Um what s the secret to that,5
teacher:Well you might not really mean multiples when you multiply them;student:That the the two multiple the two num the numbers have to like when you add them up it has to equal it has to equal the number to the to the left and be multiples of the number to the right,5
teacher:Jeff what was special about them,5
teacher:Right and what did we do then Stephanie what did we do,5
teacher:Exactly what we were doing and when we did that if we put zero in that box what number did we put in the triangle;student:Well we had to put a number in the box and a number in the triangle so that the equation was true,5
teacher:Uh you remember what you wrote on your paper,5
teacher:Now what did we do then;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Michael what d we do then,5
teacher:Here here I gave you the equation and we made the table right but now in the other problems I gave you the table and what are you supposed to do,5
teacher:Would somebody say what was the secret for this kind of equation,5
teacher:What are we doing now,5
teacher:Now what are we doing now,5
teacher:The first time I gave you an equation and what did we do,5
teacher:Would you explain it to everybody,5
teacher:OK I think that s worth thinking about Jeffery did you have something to show;student:Here it s zero and then this is two then four then six eight then ten and if you keep going down it would be twelve fourteen if it went on,5
teacher:It s up to you are you ready to show everyone;student:Should I show everyone,5
teacher:Are you ready to explain that to the camera;student:You re the one who started it,5
teacher:What number am I looking at here,5
teacher:So what am I going to do add that;student:Between zero and one is one,5
teacher:What would I put in the triangle to make it true,5
teacher:What s the two;student:Get two,5
teacher:If I put one in the box what do I have to put in the triangle to make it true;student:Be quiet,5
teacher:If I put three in the box what do I have to put in the triangle;student:What are you doing,5
teacher:OK can somebody explain what it is we re doing;student:Someone took my pencil,5
teacher:Has somebody got an equation to show me;student:Wait here s what I don t get though,5
teacher:Come show me,5
teacher:Come show me the equation,5
teacher:What are you going to show me ultimately,5
teacher:What did we do the first time,5
teacher:Suppose I put two in the box what do I have to put in the triangle to make it true;student:Oh God not the watch,5
teacher:What do the numbers in in the body of the table mean;student:These are numbers one of the dice and these are the numbers on the other die,5
teacher:What did you call one here,5
teacher:What number name would you give to  the red,5
teacher:The question is how  many 112s are in 1,5
teacher:Does anyone  want to try,5
teacher:Any ladies want to tell me how this  might work,5
teacher:Ok what  do you call this,5
teacher:What do you call this,5
teacher:If I do one divided by one twelfth what do I  get;student:One twelfth,5
teacher:Tell me how youd write the number  sentence,5
teacher:One half and one third and when we were comparing them we asked  by how much some of you came up with a solution to that which  was;student:One half and one third,5
teacher:Ok Jessica why don t  you come up and do it for us,5
teacher:In this problem where s  the switch,5
teacher:In this problem,5
teacher:The dark green and when he  called dark green then what became one sixth,5
teacher:In the other model what was white,5
teacher:Jessica s model,5
teacher:One  was Beth,5
teacher:How  many 16s go into 1,5
teacher:No  what did you have to call one sixth now,5
teacher:If this works how does it work,5
teacher:Can you  write a sentence now using um division  that would also describe the situation,5
teacher:Remember the red and  orange have the number name 1 and I want  to know what number name you might give  to the white that would make sense,5
teacher:Is there somebody who feels they  can explain how this works,5
teacher:The first is   How many whites are in a red orange  train   and the second question is  How  many   are in,5
teacher:How  many white are in the red and orange train,5
teacher:I would like you all to think  about for a minute maybe even to discuss it  with your partner what you might call these,5
teacher:How many,5
teacher:What would you call one of these;student:How many blank are in,5
teacher:So how many blanks are in  You said  how many twelfths are in,5
teacher:Are in one;student:How many twelfths are in a whole,5
teacher:Can  somebody tell me what number names I can  put in here to make the same sentence,5
teacher:Who feels confident that they could tell me  what were going to call these and how  were going to say this sentence,5
teacher:Can anybody  answer that question now,5
teacher:They  question is how many 112s are in 1,5
teacher:How could we rewrite this as  a math sentence as a number sentence,5
teacher:What do you think;student:Uh yeah but I so its like every number its  that its one divided by the fraT2ion and then  just the plain number,5
teacher:Who thinks that they have an idea for what  might be a number sentence that would  describe this,5
teacher:Umm what became ones sixth;student:Twelve I mean wait,5
teacher:What  are you thinking Beth,5
teacher:What number name what rod what  rod had the number name one sixth,5
teacher:Or Meredith suggested another name for that would be,5
teacher:Tell the  rest of the class who may not have who may have missed it,5
teacher:Maybe that s the question  you answered What s a number name for white,5
teacher:Ok I would like to hear Gregory and Danielle s solution because it s  a little bit different and then I want to hear the comment about we  have two different models we ended up with the same answer but  some of you seem to think that you could build a different model and  not necessarily have the same answer that s a very important  question,5
teacher:Okay  Danielle Gregory let s hear your thinking,5
teacher:How much bigger;student:Well we think that the um the half which is the brown um was  bigger than the fourth because if you take the brown the half and the  fourth you could see that the half is bigger,5
teacher:And what number name is that;student:By a purple,5
teacher:We have  some other models we have some other models but I d like to know  umm Andrew you want to go give model,5
teacher:Okay what is that the rest of you are saying;student:Well because out of all the people that came up here they always  had the room for one more fourth and I think that because usually  the fourths or two of  em are equal up to the half so then it would  be a fourths,5
teacher:Okay what do you think Andrew,5
teacher:Even as you move on past Algebra the questions are what kind of numbers are there and where do they go on the number line,5
teacher:Now this is really a very interesting idea I think because we often think of a line as going on and on and on without ending you know if I asked you what is the biggest number,5
teacher:How many numbers we can put on this line,5
teacher:Where you put one,5
teacher:If you were to come up here and point and guess where it would be,5
teacher:Two what;student:Two,5
teacher:Okay so you see it s bigger by how much;student:I think that is where we got a little wolbby,5
teacher:By how much;student:That is what we said,5
teacher:What is bigger and by how much,5
teacher:White then would have what number name when I call the orange and  red one,5
teacher:White would have what number name,5
teacher:What number name would I give  to white when I call the orange and red one,5
teacher:What do you think;student:aren t really sure,5
teacher:Okay what s the number name for the white when  you have an orange and red,5
teacher:What do you mean the one twelfth Brian;student:Well not both of them but the one the twelfth I can write about it,5
teacher:Ok let s try this one which is bigger one half or one quarter and by  how much,5
teacher:And if you think you know can you build me  the model to show me so that you can  explain it to us,5
teacher:Which is bigger one half or one quarter,5
teacher:So have many do you have David how many arguments can you  make how many models can you build,5
teacher:So you re going to explain how you got your different models  Alan,5
teacher:Could you explain that to Dr Davis back there;student:Two down from the orange would be the  brown,5
teacher:Whisper that to him,5
teacher:Tell him what you re doing to get your models,5
teacher:Let s hear it,5
teacher:So what did you decide;student:We wanted to use one color and we  couldn t find any thing to make a quarter of that so we went down to  the blue we couldn t find a half of that then we went down to the  black I mean brown and then we found a half of that and a quarter  for that and so we used brown and we took two purples and we put  those underneath the brown then we took then we found red were  half of purples so we put the reds underneath the purples and then  we had to see how many whites would equal up to all the would  equal up to a brown so we kept putting them on and so we found  eight,5
teacher:And whichever  is bigger by how much,5
teacher:What number name would I give to  one of the little white rods,5
teacher:Oh so what number name would you give to that,5
teacher:So how would what number name would you give for the  differences between;student:Oh a green and blue one fortyeighth,5
teacher:How does the one plus three  give you the four,5
teacher:What do  they look like the three with one red,5
teacher:What do you see I am curious,5
teacher:What do you  see in your heads,5
teacher:How do you see the three of them with exactly one red;student:Blocks,5
teacher:So how do we now get these four with one red,5
teacher:Why don t you make a picture,5
teacher:Help me see it,5
teacher:Can you show it to me,5
teacher:Okay let show me again wheres the four;student:The one one two one  one three three one one four six four one,5
teacher:Why where this ten comes  from when you know youre just saying well  theres a pattern here because you found them  but is there a way where you havent found  them that makes sense to predict the number of  paths of one you havent found,5
teacher:How would you how where would  the thirtyfive come from,5
teacher:How could you explain those  numbers,5
teacher:So what are you labeling them;student:Mm hmm,5
teacher:These blocks,5
teacher:So tell me where the 4,5
teacher:How many blues are here;student:I think that would be one the way that it would work  out it would be one blue and two reds and the next would  be two blue and one red,5
teacher:Which is it;student:two red and one blue,5
teacher:So now you have;student:You could have like um three towers where you have like 2 blue and one red  umm,5
teacher:What did you get now,5
teacher:How many of them were a match,5
teacher:And Brian how did you figure that;student:And then you  have to make like things that you cant use them because its  a match and they have to be different,5
teacher:Now my next question is How many pizzas how many towers are these problems,5
teacher:The same or;student:The same,5
teacher:How can you convince me that these are the same problem,5
teacher:Is there a way of thinking about the pizzas another way,5
teacher:Can you explain it to me;student:Yes,5
teacher:And what would the  b  mean for instance pizzas;student:Yeah,5
teacher:We have what are they;student:Mhm,5
teacher:For four high;student:Peppers,5
teacher:I m thinking of the same rows can you tell what I am supposed to imagine  in my head with towers,5
teacher:Ok so tell me so this  would be how high;student:Isn t like so many high and then so,5
teacher:If you had blue and red,5
teacher:So what does the one represent;student:If you have blue and red if you had two colors,5
teacher:Mhmm ok I could imagine that and what does the three represent;student:One of all like say blue like three high of all blue cubes,5
teacher:In the pizza if you were thinking of,5
teacher:Can you sort of kind of point Jessica,5
teacher:What are these lines you drew you drew lines  between the shirts and the pants,5
teacher:How did you get nine;student:We did it it s nine,5
teacher:David how about you explain to me what youre doing so your thinking;student:No Davids like here let me do this,5
teacher:And the reds came out to;student:Well not really because this one was one sixteenth um one  sixteenth,5
teacher:This is so interesting where are you going with this though;student:Alright so now,5
teacher:Where  are you going with this,5
teacher:What should we,5
teacher:So you think the purples one twelfth  is there another name for that  purple;student:So I think what Im gonna do,5
teacher:Is there another number name for the  purple,5
teacher:Any other  names,5
teacher:Ok we have one twelfth two twentyfourths four fortyeighths  anything else;student:Two twenty fourths,5
teacher:How many different number names and different  blocks,5
teacher:What do you think;student:Well does it have to be the same whole,5
teacher:What are green;student:Two or it can be thirds halves it could be a,5
teacher:What s one green,5
teacher:How did you get sixteenths;student:Or one fortyeighth,5
teacher:Show me they re sixteen;student:One sixteenth,5
teacher:Basically you came here for what;student:I know cuz I told,5
teacher:What did you get the difference to be;student:Yeah and the reds would be the twentyfour twentyfourths the  reds would be the twentyfourths and the white would be the forty eighths,5
teacher:I dont want to break your train of thought but whats happening  here;student:Yes those are tens,5
teacher:And what rod would you use to represent one twelfth in that model;student:I know but its easier for me to find it,5
teacher:What do you think if you had four pairs of jeans,5
teacher:What would happen,5
teacher:Oh what do we have here;student:Ok thats the second one,5
teacher:Tell me what we have here,5
teacher:In what way;student:Well because see each model is different,5
teacher:Can you tell me I want you to think real hard about it if you look at  the models do you see any relationships among them or between  them;student:So do they have a theory,5
teacher:If you look at one model and you look at another and you look  at another do you see any connections,5
teacher:What if now I gave you all the same clothes but I also gave  you another pair of jeans a black pair of jeans,5
teacher:Ok so if you were comparing three quarters  and two thirds how would you do it with that model,5
teacher:And now first of all  explain it to David and tell him if you see any connections and then  see if you can even imagine a third model and how that would be  connected but its important that David understands both of these  first,5
teacher:Ok  what do you have here David,5
teacher:What number name is this;student:Not really,5
teacher:What number name did you give it;student:Thats a whole and thats a whole,5
teacher:If this has the number name one and this has the number name one  uh are they different or the same;student:What number name,5
teacher:Are the lengths the same or  different,5
teacher:Can you make one where the lengths for what you pick one is going  to be different;student:Theyre the same,5
teacher:Why dont you tell  David what you just did so David catches up,5
teacher:If you had to give this  a number What did you call one,5
teacher:Where it would be,5
teacher:Okay so where do you think I would put negative one;student:Because you can have negative,5
teacher:Now  how could that be,5
teacher:Meredith doesn t think so and Mark what do you think,5
teacher:You told me when I called this  one the red rod right this is one half and this is one half  how could one be a bigger half,5
teacher:How;student:Mm hmm,5
teacher:What do you mean by that David;student:No because it wasn t even,5
teacher:Can you find me a  rod that would be called a half if this was my candy bar,5
teacher:What could I have done David,5
teacher:What could I have done to  make Amy so annoyed at me,5
teacher:Audra what do you think,5
teacher:What else could  I have done that could have made her feeling badly about  this,5
teacher:Yeah and Dr Martino what did I do,5
teacher:What do you think Caitlin,5
teacher:What does that have to do with what we re  doing here if anything,5
teacher:Cause then I could say to you what do you think is  bigger one half or one third,5
teacher:What do you think is bigger  one half or one third,5
teacher:What s your  comment on this,5
teacher:How  do you imagine a half of a candy bar Jackie,5
teacher:What are they thinking that the yellow and the green are  when they do that;student:I think the confusion is they think that they just they think  they have the temptation of calling since there are four red  blocks they think they re gonna call it one fourth  cause they  forget that the yellow and the green are two,5
teacher:What do you think is so confusing here,5
teacher:Okay so if it was one you said you d call it one fourth and if  it was two what did you say,5
teacher:What would you do to convince the  class that it would have the number name one and one  fourth,5
teacher:If you call the yellow and green together  one what did you call the red rod,5
teacher:So let s hear the arguments,5
teacher:How did you get one and one quarter when  you called the brown rod two now,5
teacher:I like to hear your argument and see if you convince  Sarah and Audra who want to be convinced,5
teacher:The two what Brian;student:Well we thought the two  would be called a half,5
teacher:The two of what;student:The two would be a half,5
teacher:So when yellow and green  become two the reds how could you how could you  convince us,5
teacher:Because I see your teacher there Mrs P  saying how did they get that,5
teacher:She wants to know  how did you figure that out,5
teacher:Can you convince us,5
teacher:You want to try it again now that  David helped you the way he was thinking,5
teacher:What s the difference;student:No,5
teacher:Jakki want to talk about that a little  bit,5
teacher:But what  what s confusing here,5
teacher:But if you got a third can you tell me what you would get,5
teacher:If I gave you a third of this  candy bar we shared it among all three of you here,5
teacher:Which  part would you get which part would Dr Landis get and  which part would Danielle get,5
teacher:So which is bigger;student:We found out if you take two dark greens and you make each  one a half and you make these a third they d be  equal,5
teacher:What number name is this;student:They re equal in these colors,5
teacher:What number name is this;student:A half,5
teacher:Which is bigger a half or a third;student:A third,5
teacher:Right by how much;student:Oh yeah,5
teacher:And what number name would you give the red  then,5
teacher:Remember what you called one;student:A quarter,5
teacher:What number name prove to me that red is a quarter;student:A quarter,5
teacher:Prove to me,5
teacher:Okay can you explain that,5
teacher:Ok uh I know were not going to have enough time to hear  from all these wonderful solutions Im seeing but Im hoping  that on Monday if you dont forgotten what youve done you  can start thinking about it and Dr Landis said she may stop  by here on Monday and Dr Martino will be here and we  hope youll share your solutions and write about it but lets  hear a real quick one from from Laura and from Jessica;student:Two of these white ones,5
teacher:So which is bigger;student:And one half would  be the green the dark green,5
teacher:How much bigger is it,5
teacher:So the  next question how much bigger,5
teacher:Okay so the question  is what number name would you give to the red,5
teacher:What do you have here;student:No that wouldn t work either,5
teacher:Which is bigger one half or one third,5
teacher:And I want you to tell me show me which  is bigger and I want you to tell me how much bigger and be  able to convince me,5
teacher:I want  you to draw me a model with your make me a model with  your Cuisenaire rods and to show me which is bigger one  half or one third,5
teacher:How  could we share this three equal ways,5
teacher:And how many wedges would that be for you;student:Well Danielle will have one row and Dr Landis will have  one row then I would have one row,5
teacher:So when you got half Jackie said  you got six out of twelve  and  when we got a third you got how many out of twelve,5
teacher:Who got more,5
teacher:The person who got one  half or the person who got a quarter a third,5
teacher:Who got more,5
teacher:What do you think Amy,5
teacher:Well first we put the red rods  up to the yellow and the green rod and  then we said if the yellow and the green was two what would  we call the red rods,5
teacher:So of  that candy bar right youd pick what,5
teacher:Who has the  better buy,5
teacher:So what s the question you should  always be asking yourself when youre comparing fractions,5
teacher:Which;student:Which one s bigger,5
teacher:Because when we really  ask the question which is bigger one half or one third what  are we what are we assuming,5
teacher:What s sort of the common  understanding about that,5
teacher:When I ask you that question,5
teacher:Which is bigger one half or one  third,5
teacher:What  would you want,5
teacher:Can you up and show us maybe,5
teacher:Audra what did you come up with,5
teacher:Could someone tell T2 what are the problems I ve  given you,5
teacher:What do they see in the sky when they look with more and more powerful telescopes;student:Than the more numbers you could fit onto one number line,5
teacher:What did they find,5
teacher:So they invented more powerful instruments and what did they find;student:More stars,5
teacher:So is it that the stars arent there or is it that we dont have the instrument;student:More stars,5
teacher:What do you have to say about it;student:You see when you are using the microscope it looks like you are getting more space but  in actuality youre not getting any more It just looks like it but you are not,5
teacher:Laura what do you think,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:What do you think between zero and one here,5
teacher:What kind of numbers do you think you  are seeing there,5
teacher:Any idea,5
teacher:Any idea,5
teacher:What are your ideas about the  numbers between zero and one,5
teacher:What about that;student:Yeah,5
teacher:What do you  think James,5
teacher:You are so quite back there James Amy and Jakki what are you thinking  through all this discussion,5
teacher:What happens when scientists discover more and more powerful telescopes;student:And you would still have room there to put more,5
teacher:What do you think Alan,5
teacher:What if your one whole you called a google,5
teacher:What if you called your one whole a billion;student:I know but Im just,5
teacher:Amy you want to come up and put where you think you would put negative one,5
teacher:Im guessing where would you put a negative two,5
teacher:Kimberly what do you think,5
teacher:Which way beyond zero;student:Yeah,5
teacher:And the positive one,5
teacher:Which way;student:Its beyond zero,5
teacher:Do you know what they call those numbers to the right of zero  and to the left of zero,5
teacher:Is the placement of some fractions I would like everyone to take a turn up here to place some fraction on this number line,5
teacher:Those  whole numbers,5
teacher:And negative one negative two negative three negative four  negative five,5
teacher:You know what they call them,5
teacher:Does anybody know,5
teacher:What about those numbers between particular integers,5
teacher:What do  they kind of look like and were would we place them if we want to put them on that line,5
teacher:Can you show me how that works;student:Ohmhum,5
teacher:Erik what if you one whole is a zillion;student:If you one whole is ten how could you divide it into zillionths,5
teacher:Zero one two three four five and so  forth with out stopping,5
teacher:And where would you  place four,5
teacher:And maybe I will ask Gregory to go first because you were so quite and didn t get a chance to say anything,5
teacher:Would you please do that for us,5
teacher:How many of you think you know where the two and one half would be;student:It would be behind the two,5
teacher:How many think you know where you would put two and one half;student:Two and one half,5
teacher:How much past the two,5
teacher:What do you mean by half,5
teacher:Half of what,5
teacher:Half of that ruler because that ruler is going to be between about what Amy;student:Half of that ruler,5
teacher:So where would you put two and one half,5
teacher:Audra if I gave the purple the number  name one half what number name would I give to the dark  brown,5
teacher:Can you tell me  how you would convince me,5
teacher:What if I gave the purple rod the number name one,5
teacher:What number name would I give to the brown rod,5
teacher:And you  remember if we give the orange rod the number name two  can you tell me what number name wed give to yellow,5
teacher:If I call yellow and light  green two what number name would I give to red,5
teacher:If I call yellow and light  green two what number name would I give to red,5
teacher:I d like you to make the  yellow and light green one and then tell me what the number  name would be for red also,5
teacher:But something to think about just by the way were would two and a half be;student:Ohmhuh,5
teacher:So you are telling me that if I want another fourth what would that be;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Of one and one half you would put one and three quarters,5
teacher:Can anyone give me a number name for how much to the right Meredith;student:Like that much,5
teacher:What do you think about that,5
teacher:How could you change it a little bit;student:That is not half,5
teacher:Which way would you move it,5
teacher:Closer to zero or closer to one,5
teacher:Could you move it towards the negative just a tiny bit,5
teacher:You want to put it where one is,5
teacher:You want to put it where one half is,5
teacher:Could you place a number for us between zero and two,5
teacher:In other words my question to you on this number line and remember this number line goes on and on without ending how many places is there for each fraction,5
teacher:Does it end or does it go on and on,5
teacher:The Cuisenaire rods that you build does it end or does it go on and on,5
teacher:The question is where to do you fit the other fractions and how do you give them number names,5
teacher:That would have what number name Erik;student:That is one and one half,5
teacher:Now if I have to give it a number name can you give this a number name a half when it is to the right of one,5
teacher:Where would you put one and three quarters;student:Yeah,5
teacher:How much to the right of the one and one half would you put it;student:You would probably push it a little to the right of one and one half,5
teacher:Does it end or does it go on and on,5
teacher:How do you get it;student:The number in the chart shows you the number that you get,5
teacher:So what are you doing to get the three,5
teacher:So how many outcomes are there if you re rolling two die,5
teacher:How much more,5
teacher:If you were willing to pay 200 but you only paid 120 how are you going to figure out how much more,5
teacher:How many sixth graders were on time,5
teacher:How did I get 102,5
teacher:How did I get 102,5
teacher:So if Im thinking about this problem I know that 15 were late and its asking how many were on time 15 were late what percent were on time,5
teacher:If 15 were late what percent were on time,5
teacher:Kyan where did you get 85;student:Eightyfive,5
teacher:How many cars in the parking lot are not blue,5
teacher:What is the number of cars that are not blue;student:I got 25,5
teacher:Andrew what did you do,5
teacher:What does 25 represent Andrew,5
teacher:Then what would you have to do,5
teacher:So you could have answered how many cars are in the parking lot,5
teacher:How much would you have spent before the clearance,5
teacher:So the question says how much more were you willing to pay than you actually paid,5
teacher:If you would have bought them at full price how much would you have spent,5
teacher:What does the 200 represent,5
teacher:Simplify that with;student:Then youre going to simplify,5
teacher:15 thats this first one my next strategy is I can do whats 320,5
teacher:So whats 15 5,5
teacher:What times five equals 15,5
teacher:So whats 15 divided by 5,5
teacher:Then you have to multiply by the numerator because whats 103,5
teacher:Now what should be our strategy here what do you think,5
teacher:So whats 13 times 2,5
teacher:So 26 3,5
teacher:How many threes are in 26,5
teacher:Eight with how many left over,5
teacher:Fivetens of 20,5
teacher:How much more were you willing to pay for tickets,5
teacher:What did we do to get the answer,5
teacher:Megan whatd you guys do first,5
teacher:Where are we going to put the numbers,5
teacher:What does that 200 represent,5
teacher:Is it the part or the whole,5
teacher:So did you pay part of the total or the whole total,5
teacher:If you had to pay full price how much would you have spent before the clearance,5
teacher:How many kids is that,5
teacher:If we know 10 kids like to free draw how many like group activities,5
teacher:Now what do we do,5
teacher:What percentage of the people who like group activities are boys,5
teacher:How many boys are there in our club,5
teacher:How many sixth graders were on time to school,5
teacher:Who would like to share how they got 102,5
teacher:How did you know,5
teacher:15 is not is it was of its down there so then whatd you do,5
teacher:What does that 18 represent;student:Yes and then I divided 100 by 100 to give X by itself and I did the same on the other side and then I got 18,5
teacher:What is 18,5
teacher:Lynda what did you have to do to figure out because the question says how many were on time,5
teacher:120 and you got;student:From yes,5
teacher:Thats all the kids in the 6th grade in this school and 15 were late what percent were on time,5
teacher:If I put Lets say that I said 85 of the kids were on time and without simplifying out these two you have 100x equals Somebody do 120 times 85;student:Yes,5
teacher:What are the two different things,5
teacher:how many then like to free draw,5
teacher:So this  so how many like free drawing,5
teacher:You have this one  theyre both boys and how many boys are there,5
teacher:How many fluid ounces of juice do you actually get,5
teacher:How many fluid ounces of juice do you actually get of the 16 ounces,5
teacher:How many ounces are ice,5
teacher:How many ounces are taken up of that 16 with ice,5
teacher:What percent if 30 is ice what percent is juice,5
teacher:That would tell you how much juice it is or you could have gotten the 48 and then what do you have to do with your 48,5
teacher:How much did he weigh in fourth grade,5
teacher:Five then Im going to multiply by the numerator which makes;student:Five,5
teacher:Is your answer going to be more or less than 90 pounds,5
teacher:Seventyfive what;student:Seventyfive,5
teacher:How many boys are in art club,5
teacher:How many like to free draw,5
teacher:What are you going to do with those,5
teacher:How is it going to be 200  in our club of boys when theres  in our club;student:I didnt say it was a hundred but we already have that one,5
teacher:How many kids like group activities,5
teacher:What I did is I wrote you know that  and how many like free drawing,5
teacher:How much did this sixthgrader weigh when he was in fourth grade,5
teacher:If you have 34 of 20 your 2 strategies would be Im going to do 20 4 first and thats what,5
teacher:All right we know that this line what does this line mean;student:So its the same number divided by five,5
teacher:All right then what did you notice about these four;student:Two,5
teacher:Whats another possibility,5
teacher:Another possibility Clay,5
teacher:Smith what is the possibility,5
teacher:Where is your friend,5
teacher:Where is the friend,5
teacher:Somebody give me an ordered pair to say,5
teacher:What is it,5
teacher:Im going to say give me another clock point somebody,5
teacher:How far away am I from your coordinate,5
teacher:How many blocks,5
teacher:That means my next guess should be how many blocks away,5
teacher:How many blocks away am I,5
teacher:We know that which digit is in the 10th place,5
teacher:Weve got a lot of people that got this one wrong so we want to make sure that were understanding why what digit is in the 10th place,5
teacher:The eight that means you what;student:The eight,5
teacher:Austin give me one possibility so far,5
teacher:Stella what is the coordinate for the movie theatre,5
teacher:What did you guys say,5
teacher:Which is a longer walk,5
teacher:What is the park entrance ordered pair;student:Yes,5
teacher:Then what is the pizzaria s coordinates,5
teacher:How about the fewest number of blocks you would walk from the library to the ice cream shop,5
teacher:You need to go to the ice cream shop which is,5
teacher:How many blocks do you need to go over;student:14 12,5
teacher:From one to 14 how many blocks is that,5
teacher:How many more blocks is that,5
teacher:All right good we agreed on that one that it was zero and nine,5
teacher:How about the school,5
teacher:Macey what did you get,5
teacher:We need to go over how many,5
teacher:All right  how many over do we need to go,5
teacher:How many up do we need to go;student:Two,5
teacher:How many is that total;student:12,5
teacher:Which is a longer walk going from the family restaurant to the boat rental where is that,5
teacher:Okay is it a longer walk to go from the family restaurant to the boat rental or from the post office to the fire department,5
teacher:How about the school to the pool entrance,5
teacher:No 85 times 120,5
teacher:Show all right pretty good everybody read what you wrote,5
teacher:Howd you get that;student:I got 8 and 294 1000th,5
teacher:Which is the tenths place;student:Yes,5
teacher:What digit is in the tenths place,5
teacher:So now what did you do Margo,5
teacher:Then what;student:Yes,5
teacher:Remember if its a five what do we do,5
teacher:Somebody tell me what digit is in the hundredths spot,5
teacher:If it s a six what do we do,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:What s that,5
teacher:What is your answer,5
teacher:All right looking at this what do we know about this;student:For number two I got three four seven two,5
teacher:One this says 1515 Stella,5
teacher:Okay 2015 Abby,5
teacher:Hey everybody 35;student:I know that 20 5 is 4 so it is 4,5
teacher:10;student:Seven,5
teacher:Before you even did that what did you have to know,5
teacher:Somebody take me through their thinking on this one,5
teacher:You looked and you just said Oh that s closest to the whole number of;student:Yes,5
teacher:How did you get your answer,5
teacher:What digit is in the 1000th place,5
teacher:The three so you looked at the;student:The three,5
teacher:Eight and you knew what;student:Eight,5
teacher:Everybody read what they have;student:I round it up to the five as well,5
teacher:Shylows going to tell us how she got seven,5
teacher:Our learning targets are basically the same theres one change to adding and subtracting decimals we are adding one symbol anybody know what it is,5
teacher:Here is what youre going to do right now you had 146 in your PiggyBank you found 17 cents between the couch cushions how much money do you have now,5
teacher:Hey we have some different answers out there let see Vicki tell me what you got dont erase you guys,5
teacher:Lets see Hudson what did you and your partner talk about in terms of when you just saw it what did you know you had to do,5
teacher:What was I talking about when I said you have the right digits but not the right answer MarcSamantha;student:162,5
teacher:Stop that  Alexander can do it for you so you bought a vegetable tray for 1219 you paid with a 20 bill how much change do you get back,5
teacher:Hey I am asking person two tell me not the answer tell me what you are doing to get the answer what do you know you have to do,5
teacher:Somebody take me through the process Ill call on somebody person four all right take me through the process  shhh,5
teacher:How much change do we get back;student:Now that weve got all the borrowing now it will be 10 minus 9 which is 1 9 minus 1 which is 8 9 minus 2 which is 7 and 1 minus 1 is nothing,5
teacher:All right 17 what did you get;student:Yes here we go now,5
teacher:All right what did you get;student:Thats me,5
teacher:Jacob what was your answer that you got when you added those two together,5
teacher:All right Smith how many blocks,5
teacher:Divide 10200 by 100,5
teacher:There are four blue cars in the parking lot how many cars in the parking lot are not blue,5
teacher:When do we find surface area,5
teacher:What is a threedimensional object,5
teacher:Whats happening,5
teacher:If Im finding this surface area what do you think Im finding on this shape,5
teacher:Talk to your group what am I finding,5
teacher:What is the face of a shape,5
teacher:What is a face,5
teacher:What is an edge of a threedimensional shape;student:Oh okay,5
teacher:An edge Walker,5
teacher:What is a vertex,5
teacher:What is the vertex Cody;student:Oh I know,5
teacher:You could also call it the what,5
teacher:They both have a base that is a hexagon which ones a pyramid and which one is a prism,5
teacher:This one is the pyramid and this one is the;student:A pyramid is that one,5
teacher:Look at all the faces of this one what are the faces,5
teacher:What is this whole graph showing us,5
teacher:Im trying to see so this one what is this one,5
teacher:What is this one,5
teacher:What is this one down here,5
teacher:What does the Yaxis represent,5
teacher:What are our independent and dependent variables in this one,5
teacher:What depends on what,5
teacher:Its miles what,5
teacher:Its miles what,5
teacher:Miles what;student:It was him,5
teacher:Gage miles what;student:Im right next to you,5
teacher:Maybe we use the variable M This depends on what,5
teacher:Whats our independent variable,5
teacher:What is your equation for this,5
teacher:Jeremy you probably have an equation,5
teacher:Who has got an equation for me,5
teacher:What do we need to add to this graph though,5
teacher:What should we add to this graph Martin,5
teacher:Okay what else could I add and I need to add though;student:You could add the X and Y to show that its like the Y is going up and the X is over there,5
teacher:This is hours;student:Hours traveled,5
teacher:This one is a,5
teacher:When we have a converted figure what is step number one,5
teacher:Step number one,5
teacher:What is this 17 on this line right here,5
teacher:What does this represent Jorge,5
teacher:How long what is Neil,5
teacher:Do we know any parts of this whole distance,5
teacher:Do we know any of those parts,5
teacher:If the whole thing is 17 and now weve taken away 5 of it how much is left to figure out,5
teacher:No how much is left to figure out Leon;student:Six,5
teacher:Two parts which are how long total,5
teacher:Whats 6  5,5
teacher:Whats 11  6,5
teacher:The base is how much on the yellow triangle,5
teacher:Five and the height is;student:Five,5
teacher:How about the blue triangle,5
teacher:Right now that we have written our name of our shape weve written our formulas weve identified the base and the height of each of our shapes what is the next step,5
teacher:What is the word Im looking for,5
teacher:6  5 is 11  6 is,5
teacher:Whats 12 divided by 2,5
teacher:Whats half of 12,5
teacher:If this and this theres two sections and if I were to put them together theyre 12 how much is each one then,5
teacher:Then youre going to write,5
teacher:What is the formula for the area of a triangle;student:You might want to use your paper to hold it,5
teacher:Whats the formula for the area of a square,5
teacher:What are the base and the height of the blue triangle,5
teacher:What are the base and the height of the square,5
teacher:Five is the;student:Five,5
teacher:What are the base and the height of these triangles,5
teacher:Minutes worked;student:Time,5
teacher:Talk with your team what do you think,5
teacher:If the whole thing is 17 do you know how much this space is,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:If the whole thing is 17 and this much is five whats left over,5
teacher:If this is 17 and were going to take away five whats leftover,5
teacher:Whats 17  5;student:both,5
teacher:If the rest is 12 and theres how many sections,5
teacher:What do you think for you,5
teacher:What do you think the 17 represents,5
teacher:What is the Xaxis representing,5
teacher:What is it increasing by every time now,5
teacher:If I workout for 30 minutes,5
teacher:How much does it hold total,5
teacher:If its 30 ice what percent does it have juice,5
teacher:If youre getting a discount of 40 off the total what percentage are you paying,5
teacher:If you said you have this 40 off the total the whole thing is 150 is what,5
teacher:I get the x is equal to 60 what does that 60 represent Gideon,5
teacher:What do I have to do with that 45,5
teacher:What do I need to do Seth,5
teacher:Now its 10 of whats my sale price,5
teacher:15045,5
teacher:Which one is your snowboard cheaper,5
teacher:Heres the snowboard in option A heres the snowboard in option B which ones cheaper,5
teacher:This one you figured out your discount is 60 off this one your discount is 45 off plus 1050 off which is 5550 which discount is more money off 60 or 5550,5
teacher:Answers should be circled then you should write 40 off is the better,5
teacher:Guys if youre getting numbers thats like 0693 Nina right and its money what would you do,5
teacher:If you want to find tax of something for like number whats that,5
teacher:What is that 48 ounces of Travis,5
teacher:What does that 30 represent,5
teacher:We also know that 30 is what,5
teacher:Is that 16 ounces the whole glass or part of the glass,5
teacher:Zara what did you do,5
teacher:Hold on so you had to do In your proportion where does the four go;student:Me and Lane first we did simplify the  16X equals 100,5
teacher:If you looks at this four cars is 16 so how many cars is 100,5
teacher:What does that 25 mean,5
teacher:Zara what does that mean,5
teacher:Four of them are blue so Zara how many of them are not blue,5
teacher:How much would you have spent before the markdown,5
teacher:Your meal start 275 and the tax is what percent,5
teacher:If everything was 100 you had to pay 100 how much would you have to spend on that one,5
teacher:This 116 is this the whole amount or part of the amount;student:More,5
teacher:Where does part go in your equation;student:Part,5
teacher:How much would you have paid,5
teacher:This one is What is this,5
teacher:If it did ask how much you saved how much did you save Spencer,5
teacher:How many fluid ounces of juice do you actually get,5
teacher:How many fluid ounces of juice is actually in that cup if its 30 ice,5
teacher:Guys if you went to Target and you bought the stuff and it was not on sale would you pay more or less than 116,5
teacher:How many cars are in the parking lot are not blue,5
teacher:Whats 5 as a decimal,5
teacher:From here then what are you going to do,5
teacher:How do I get to F Brock,5
teacher:Deb E,5
teacher:G Royce,5
teacher:Rebecca Y,5
teacher:The next problem My other questions how much money is in his savings account after eight driveways,5
teacher:What are my two variables in this problem,5
teacher:What are my two variables in this problem,5
teacher:Okay so which is independent which is dependent;student:Variables RC for calories and M for minutes,5
teacher:The total calories you burn depends on;student:You could even be more specific and say total calories burned,5
teacher:All right what is our equation,5
teacher:What does this 200 represent,5
teacher:If I start with zero minutes on the elliptical how many calories have I burned,5
teacher:If I workout for 10 minutes how many calories have I burned,5
teacher:However if I workout for 20 minutes how many calories is it,5
teacher:Whats 200200,5
teacher:How do I get to I,5
teacher:I Sasha;student:P,5
teacher:P Eva,5
teacher:Katrina how do I get to N,5
teacher:you have to go up or down,5
teacher:That means up or down;student:Positive,5
teacher:We are going to go up to six so what letter is that;student:Up,5
teacher:Is positive two over this way or this way,5
teacher:That means up or down,5
teacher:Where is,5
teacher:Number one what point is at  Michael,5
teacher:Okay how would you tell me to find letter J;student:4 thats a thing,5
teacher:What is at,5
teacher:What is at  Tara;student:H,5
teacher:What is at  Marco;student:R,5
teacher:Q Renee whats at,5
teacher:Rebecca whats at;student:S,5
teacher:Jamie whats at;student:F,5
teacher:Please tell me the ordered pair to get to J,5
teacher:Youre going to tell me how would I get to J Deb,5
teacher:D Number three what is at  Leo;student:D,5
teacher:It tells you if you started of course 0 0 youre going over six and up five thats how many blocks,5
teacher:Then what is 6  5,5
teacher:5 6 or 6 5;student:5 6,5
teacher:Feel free to use the board and show me and tell me,5
teacher:So what does it mean;student:We were into it,5
teacher:And these towers are how tall;student:And that would be fortyfive and thats thats what this number would be,5
teacher:So so youre saying thats fortyfive and what if I wanted eight red;student:Fortyfive I think,5
teacher:Eight red ones or eight as,5
teacher:Howd you do that so fast Michael;student:Like how do you how do you how do you do that on a calculator,5
teacher:Tell us how you did it;student:You go to uh math,5
teacher:Tell me,5
teacher:But if you didnt have the calculator;student:We know how to do it I mean its not,5
teacher:Because Alex wants to know how you do that without a calculator;student:Well Bob,5
teacher:Why dont you show us up here Michael;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Explain it to me on the board,5
teacher:What does this have to do with the towers and what you were showing me about a plus b to the n;student:It is impressive huh,5
teacher:Can you explain this because poor Researcher 3 is trying to understand this and shes not following Michael,5
teacher:I think Im getting switch back So could you give me an example,5
teacher:Can you sort of tell me about it and how some of you suggested its connected to other things you had done,5
teacher:Michael start from the beginning very slow;student:You want to be in a line and well show them,5
teacher:Ok so then going back to your rule here  would  you leave it this way or what would you do would you do anything else  to it,5
teacher:If I gave you this to preform how  would you go about it,5
teacher:What is that,5
teacher:OK then;student:Four,5
teacher:How did you get this;student:Plus one is thirteen,5
teacher:Can you explain me this;student:Six times three is eighteen plus one is nineteen,5
teacher:So whats the rule for this  one;student:Yeah that is  supposed to be twentyfive,5
teacher:Wait what you do first to the X;student:X you plus three and then times,5
teacher:Can you show if that works for these values,5
teacher:What is five times three,5
teacher:Can you think of a way of writing  this rule in a more general form,5
teacher:If you want to tell someone without  giving specific examples how would you tell what the rule is,5
teacher:Is this how about this;student:Yeah,5
teacher:How would you work on this,5
teacher:What would you do,5
teacher:What would you do  for that,5
teacher:You say it is twentyone how did you go about it,5
teacher:To find the answer for this expression,5
teacher:Stand up and show us;student:You have five people,5
teacher:Stand up and show us,5
teacher:Explain it to me with that;student:Well,5
teacher:Let me ask you to explain that to Brian for a minute but well let him eat first,5
teacher:Well you know um Brian wasnt here so you might want to give him some background to what youve been doing;student:Um how do you want me to to Where do you want me to go from here,5
teacher:Well I want you to show me how the addition rule works in general;student:So where where do you want to go with with this,5
teacher:Can you write it can you write it as an equation;student:And that s cause,5
teacher:In fact I wish someone would do it on the board on the right there,5
teacher:Write that addition statement using factorial notations,5
teacher:What do you all think,5
teacher:And you know you you told me you could write that how,5
teacher:As,5
teacher:Could you walk me through the problem you were working on;student:I dont think we need one,5
teacher:What did you find;student:mhmm,5
teacher:Could you walk me through that very slowly;student:Take it Mike,5
teacher:How did you do that;student:I wish we had the stuff we had,5
teacher:Okay how did you do that and what did you find,5
teacher:Could you show me what it looks like and how you thought about it,5
teacher:Explain that one more time Michael please;student:Oh all right,5
teacher:So whats four choose two plus four choose three,5
teacher:How would you draw your little arrow to shows that,5
teacher:OK show me;student:Uhhuh,5
teacher:OK so what did that have to do with what you did in class today;student:And thats how we got off to to here,5
teacher:Show me on the board Michael;student:Like um if you go to the one three three one part of it it would be um,5
teacher:Three choose what;student:Obviously three different places,5
teacher:What was the next one,5
teacher:Show me what that looks like with that new notation,5
teacher:Write your next row Michael;student:Instead of writing three you write,5
teacher:What do you mean by toppings;student:Keep on adding,5
teacher:Four times,5
teacher:Um for example;student:Pizza toppings,5
teacher:Where you have towers,5
teacher:What s the middle one there;student:Yeah put it at the end make it nice,5
teacher:What would you how would you show the middle one,5
teacher:OK now now show me show me while you re up there Jeff just show me uh an addition rule of Pascal s Triangle;student:Now you can,5
teacher:Let s say from give me an example from the third fourth row to the fifth row,5
teacher:Show me that three plus three is six;student:All right,5
teacher:Which ones would it be,5
teacher:What would the general row look like;student:Is that one,5
teacher:Can you explain that;student:Four times three is twelve,5
teacher:How you got this;student:Are we supposed to write all the  rules,5
teacher:How many rules did you guys do;student:There you go,5
teacher:Have you guessed have you guessed my rule yet;student:Oh that relates to our,5
teacher:What do you think the rule is;student:Yeah the rule is by two,5
teacher:Now before you write down 3 what do you think  its going to be,5
teacher:Tell him what tell them what the rule was;student:Yea,5
teacher:What number do you want to try  now,5
teacher:What do you think the answer is going to be;student:Its ten,5
teacher:What do you mean by same thing;student:Its the same thing,5
teacher:How do you compare the first one and the second one when you  were telling me it is the same thing;student:Next,5
teacher:So explain to me what you are doing here,5
teacher:And what about for twentyfive;student:Because zero plus five is five and then one plus six is seven and then  two plus seven is nine then three plus eight is eleven and four plus nine  is thirteen,5
teacher:What if I wanted to know the value for eightytwo,5
teacher:Do you want to explain to  him what you have found,5
teacher:OK then how about if I ask you for eightytwo X is eightytwo;student:No I dont remember,5
teacher:If X was eightytwo,5
teacher:OK so what did you use to get this number;student:Its One hundred and sixty four and then you gotta add five so  one hundred  and sixtynine,5
teacher:What number do you think my rule is  going to give back for eight,5
teacher:He says that any number I put in this column you do  what Ariel,5
teacher:Does anyone else have a guess;student:Mmhmm,5
teacher:Tell me what you think if we have six what do you think is  going to happen to six;student:When you had,5
teacher:What do you mean by that Ankur;student:As long as it has the same number of,5
teacher:Could you tell us what those numbers are;student:This shows kind of you could get and I did this basically show both,5
teacher:Like what s in the rows and what those numbers are with the column,5
teacher:Tell us what they each represent,5
teacher:Can you get in  imagine in your head the possible How many possible outcomes are there if you re rolling three,5
teacher:What was the one number from this one,5
teacher:For a sum that you wanted to pick,5
teacher:Ok and then you told me you found another way of finding the  numbers;student:Yeah,5
teacher:If you had one chance to roll the dice and everything was on it what number would you choose,5
teacher:that you would choose;student:Nothing,5
teacher:Youre going to try and guess it but do you know how youre  going to try and guess the rule;student:And then you got to guess it,5
teacher:So the first number was what;student:Then how are we supposed to know,5
teacher:And it gave you;student:Five and then,5
teacher:So Dawud said three and my number my what do you think  my number is going to do to three;student:Three,5
teacher:Okay so what are the two results we have so far,5
teacher:What do you  think my rule is going to do to six,5
teacher:Suppose you re rolling three what is the one number,5
teacher:What exactly  what exactly did you find there,5
teacher:Can you explain to T2 what you have found here;student:Yeah and then you notice that eightytwo plus,5
teacher:Can you show me;student:Yeah it worked for all of them and then we came up with this one,5
teacher:So Ariel what do we get here;student:Seventyfive,5
teacher:If X equals twentyfive then  what does Y equal,5
teacher:If X equals twentyfive so Y equals;student:Huh,5
teacher:And James you said when X equals twentyfive what does Y  equal;student:Seventyfive,5
teacher:When X equals twentyfive what is Y equal;student:Huh,5
teacher:So I want you to explain to  each other whats your rule  and whats your rule,5
teacher:And you explain what your rule is;student:Mine is times three plus one,5
teacher:What are you adding that plus one plus three plus five to;student:Mine is every number odd add in order like plus one plus three plus  five,5
teacher:OK so what if I gave you eightyfour for X;student:Yeah,5
teacher:What if I gave you eightyfour for X;student:Huh,5
teacher:Between which one and which one;student:I  dont know how to say it,5
teacher:What about twentyfive;student:I know twentyfive times three is seventyfive there is something out  there I just dont know how to explain it,5
teacher:Alright so what are you noticing with the numbers;student:I forgot to write down,5
teacher:What are you noticing with the numbers;student:Huh,5
teacher:would you like to make up your own so  that maybe we could give it to the rest of the class,5
teacher:How you got seventysix;student:Yeah twentyfive,5
teacher:So Ariel let me ask you what would you get for twentyfive;student:You just keep on adding three and you get all of your  answers,5
teacher:What you will get for four;student:Huh,5
teacher:What will you get for four;student:And 3 times 3 is 9 plus  1 is 10,5
teacher:Tell me what you mean by its add by odd numbers;student:Its adding by all odd numbers,5
teacher:OK so what would be if we did zero one two three what if we had  four;student:This plus five is seven Yeah  and then three plus seven is ten,5
teacher:What would be our Y,5
teacher:If I give you four for X,5
teacher:What if I gave you six for X,5
teacher:What if I gave you my favorite number twentyfive again for X;student:Then I know for five it would be eleven and then six would be thirteen  so it would be nineteen,5
teacher:OK so what you think we can do,5
teacher:And so how would you express that rule,5
teacher:How did you come up with that;student:Oh fiftyfive,5
teacher:Can you explain me this,5
teacher:But can you first explain me this what you got and then you can tell me  that one;student:I already figured this one out,5
teacher:So how you got this;student:Oh I found that I was  like I came up with the first rule we got was times two plus five zero  times two plus five is five one times two plus five is seven and so on  and so on and then we came up with,5
teacher:What is this,5
teacher:How you got this,5
teacher:OK then what is this here;student:And the pattern I also see is that it keeps on adding two we have  five plus two is seven seven plus two is nine plus two is eleven plus  two is thirteen plus two is fifteen,5
teacher:And how you figure out this rule,5
teacher:What was that word,5
teacher:And could you explain how you got that;student:That it was   the chance of that happening was oneeighth,5
teacher:Whats the half,5
teacher:So what does the table represent;student:This is the probability,5
teacher:What piece of it becomes one and a half,5
teacher:Well if were calling this light green three  what are you calling this train with the light green and the  orange together,5
teacher:You were thinking of the whole length of the train as being  thirteen of what;student:Well the yellow is I think the yellows um I think yellow is  about five long and the green in the middle Ten  eleven twelve and then thirteen thirteen yellows,5
teacher:Thirteen blues thirteen oranges thirteen what;student:Thirteen,5
teacher:Ok what  happens to this guy tho,5
teacher:How can I be fair in my making my two halves the same  size,5
teacher:What could I do,5
teacher:Uh huh oh but I have one for this guy and one for this guy  one for this guy and what about this guy;student:And you could replace those two those  three with a light green yeah on of the light greens like that,5
teacher:And then what could I do with it if I sawed it in half;student:Yeah,5
teacher:Im looking for what 13 is as a percent,5
teacher:What do you think I set up here on the board,5
teacher:What do you think we should do it,5
teacher:What am I going to do in this column you think,5
teacher:Ethan what was your clear;student:Whoa man,5
teacher:Let s review together what does a bar graph look like,5
teacher:How does this become one and a half,5
teacher:Does anyone know what,5
teacher:What do you mean one and a half;student:If thats a light green then you  could just make a yellow and add one and a half to the yellow  and one and a half to the other yellow,5
teacher:Brian what did you want to add,5
teacher:Ok  Now if  we call the orange  two  what can we say about yellow,5
teacher:Brian what do you think now when we call this we give  this the number name two the orange what number name are  we going to give to yellow,5
teacher:You can come up here  and show us,5
teacher:So the number name youre giving yellow then was what,5
teacher:Okay what would you call it Erik;student:You can call it another name,5
teacher:What would I call the  yellowwhat number name would I call the yellow,5
teacher:Can you come up and tell us about  that,5
teacher:To wrap up the lesson we brought all of our data together and what conclusions could we make from it,5
teacher:What did you mean Kimberly,5
teacher:If you want this to be five what would you have to call the  orange;student:I made the mistake thinking from before I forgot that adding  one and one is two but five and five isnt six so I made that  mistake,5
teacher:Ok  is there somebody who would like to share a solution with me to  show me one half of this train which has an orange and a green,5
teacher:To show me something that is one half as long as this orange  and green train,5
teacher:Could you come up  and show,5
teacher:If you worked with Mark the two of you can come  up and show us,5
teacher:You have any ideas,5
teacher:Okay can you say a little bit more about that;student:So those two blocks and half of that would equal up to it and it  would help,5
teacher:Tell me what you were thinking;student:I figured it out now,5
teacher:Can you show us  your yellow and your purple,5
teacher:If you could give somebody a hint as to know how many zeros where do they look here,5
teacher:How many zeros should we have,5
teacher:How many circles;student:I made circles and then I filled them in,5
teacher:How many square feet are planted with bean plants,5
teacher:What is the area of my living room,5
teacher:To get the area and you got;student:Yes and then I did 12x24,5
teacher:You and your partner are going to figure out the What is it,5
teacher:That Hudson is walking from where to where,5
teacher:All right do we have any ideas,5
teacher:What are some routes,5
teacher:Bruce do you want to come up and draw the route,5
teacher:Remember the school What is the schools order here,5
teacher:How many blocks was that,5
teacher:How many blocks is that,5
teacher:How many blocks,5
teacher:What is the order pair of the school,5
teacher:What is the order pair of the grocery stores;student:0 0,5
teacher:Delilah whatd you do,5
teacher:Did you draw a picture or did you just do the math,5
teacher:Meagan how did you get 14;student:I got 14,5
teacher:How many beads are blue,5
teacher:If I said to you what is 12 of 10 what would you tell me,5
teacher:What is 12 of 12;student:No,5
teacher:What is 12 of 14;student:Six,5
teacher:Sheila  who ate more carrots,5
teacher:Sheila how many do you think Lauren ate,5
teacher:How did you get 11;student:I think she ate 11,5
teacher:Does anybody know what of stands for,5
teacher:How many zeros should you have,5
teacher:Whats 12 you guys said of 10,5
teacher:What was the problem;student:I know I found the problem,5
teacher:How did you realize that;student:I realized that Evan ate twelve,5
teacher:Who ate more,5
teacher:did he eat more or fewer carrots than Lauren,5
teacher:Everett,5
teacher:Phil what do you think;student:Yes,5
teacher:How much carrots does he have,5
teacher:What did you tell me it was,5
teacher:What is the opposite of this,5
teacher:Show us what you have there David;student:I dont think there is anything,5
teacher:What do  you think,5
teacher:So what might we be thinking,5
teacher:Are you all how did you look at it,5
teacher:Okay now  okay so Mikes approach was to make this binary coding to code into these two digit binary numbeTeacher and to connect to Pascals triangle uh what were the other approaches that you did for this to get the eight over thirtytwo,5
teacher:Could you show me how you wrote them;student:And then we wrote the eight out which which would satisfy that,5
teacher:Did you just pick them at random or did you have uh did you have a way of;student:Thats how we did it like this,5
teacher:Could you show me;student:Well we have like an organized way like you bring the A through and,5
teacher:Could somebody go to the board and do that;student:What do you want the two or the eight,5
teacher:Show me what you did;student:Just for just the eight right,5
teacher:And what about five games;student:And thats where we got our two,5
teacher:Okay  so  lets see twosixteenths whats that;student:Mhmm,5
teacher:And eight thirtyseconds whats that;student:Hmhm,5
teacher:Howd you get that,5
teacher:What about the probability of winning the series in exactly seven games,5
teacher:What do you mean,5
teacher:What if you had to calculate it directly,5
teacher:What does it mean,5
teacher:Uh what do we think about that situation,5
teacher:Well suppose were the home team and that weve won three out of the fiTeachert four games what do we think about the fifth game;student:Thats just a way to express how thats one of four ways to express how the home team won three out of the four games,5
teacher:Could you show me how you would check that;student:Yeah I think you are,5
teacher:And what does sixteen represent;student:mhmm,5
teacher:And thats how you got oneeighth;student:mhmm,5
teacher:Okay   So what came next;student:Yes,5
teacher:How do you deal with that,5
teacher:Now could we go into detail,5
teacher:So   so  it looks like  uh  the part we dont see yet because we havent explained it yet is what do the games what are the possibilities of the fiTeachert four games when the fifth game is a win for away or similarly what are the possibilities for the fiTeachert four games when the,5
teacher:When;student:Three,5
teacher:Wanna take a shot at it;student:Divide by half for the other line and go down,5
teacher:How do you organize those;student:Three wins,5
teacher:How do you count it;student:It s with the triangle right,5
teacher:What are all the different ideas here;student:I guess so,5
teacher:How does it go;student:Let me just,5
teacher:What are the two;student:This one has  theres two in that those four combinations that have,5
teacher:Could you show me that;student:One will have another  one will have a zero or one at the end of it,5
teacher:How did you find those;student:It was out of sixtyfour,5
teacher:How does that fit into your picture,5
teacher:How do you see those,5
teacher:David can  you tell me what those conditions are,5
teacher:How do you  could you show me that check;student:Yeah,5
teacher:What would you look at,5
teacher:What would you do for a four game series;student:You just add that,5
teacher:Why would you,5
teacher:What does it come out to be,5
teacher:Okay so what about a six game series;student:I hope its not,5
teacher:What would the probabilities look like that time,5
teacher:What are the probabilities of those things happening,5
teacher:How do you see that;student:In the fiTeachert game we may have a two thirds chance of winning right,5
teacher:How do you know it works;student:But only if someone would tell us once,5
teacher:But Im wondering what happens when theyre not;student:PeTeacheronally I would not,5
teacher:Out out of all the games whats the probability its won in the seventh;student:Youre asking out of all the chances,5
teacher:What about something between purple and  yellow;student:Thats right,5
teacher:What do you think Brian,5
teacher:What do you think of that,5
teacher:What do you think about that Andrew,5
teacher:Alan do  you want to try again,5
teacher:Wait youre doing this youre doing this for a five game series or a four games series;student:So you multiply this four times,5
teacher:Go on go on and explain the rest of this,5
teacher:How would you go after it,5
teacher:How would you go after this;student:I dont know,5
teacher:Um how often do you do you think that the teams are even evenly matched,5
teacher:how would that effect it,5
teacher:UH how would you look at the probability,5
teacher:How would you calculate the probability of one of those teams,5
teacher:One or the other in other words,5
teacher:Suppose we believe that  say the home team is twice as likely to win any given game as the away team whats the probability of the World Series that the World Series would take exactly four games;student:Probably that,5
teacher:How do you see that;student:All right,5
teacher:How might you get a handle on it;student:Mhmm,5
teacher:Um if the teams are equally matched whats the probability of Team A winning one game,5
teacher:What would be the numbeTeacher,5
teacher:Okay so now suppose Team A is twice as good as Team B whats the probability of Team A winning one game;student:Yes,5
teacher:Could you walk me through that slowly;student:And one out of eighty one chance that it  twice as bad,5
teacher:I want I want to undeTeachertand how you see the eightyone,5
teacher:And then finally the seventeen and the sixteen,5
teacher:Now what what would you do to figure out the probability for one of the one of the teams,5
teacher:One or the other of the two teams winning the World Series in five games in exactly five games,5
teacher:How would you express that as a probability;student:fiftyfifty,5
teacher:How about the pink square Neil,5
teacher:What is the opposite  of this,5
teacher:What is the opposite of  this,5
teacher:Blank the blank of the measures,5
teacher:Which one of those methods would fit into that,5
teacher:We have three different ways which one would fit into there,5
teacher:Where did they get that,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:What do you think they how do you think they got that 80 degrees,5
teacher:So he said V C B if you do that minus angle one which was 100 that leaves you with what,5
teacher:You have 80 you have measure of angle two which is,5
teacher:So that gives you 100 so that angle V A V C has to be,5
teacher:Which one A C what;student:Or you can do A C is the  outside the angle is outside the circle,5
teacher:Cause were trying to stick with this general pattern of it ending up being whats it end up being every time,5
teacher:If youve been following this pattern of the angle it turns out to be,5
teacher:So if youre if you have your what sides it on,5
teacher:Read that theorem for me and fill in the blanks,5
teacher:Half of the,5
teacher:The measures of an angle formed by two secants or chords that intersect the interior of the circle is what,5
teacher:Whats it called,5
teacher:Which one there;student:Cause,5
teacher:So what do you think about measure of A V C,5
teacher:Where could they have gotten that 100 degrees,5
teacher:So the next one says if A C is 180 degrees B D is 70 degrees what about angle one,5
teacher:Or angle two,5
teacher:If A C is 180 what does that angle one have to be,5
teacher:How about B D,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:So what does that leave us with for A V C,5
teacher:With Michaelas first method it would be what did we come up with,5
teacher:Ninety and 35 added together,5
teacher:What would that give us,5
teacher:What about the other way,5
teacher:If we do 180 plus 70 what does that give us,5
teacher:Divide that in half you get;student:Divide that,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:How about measure of angle two has to be half of,5
teacher:Youre talking about A V C or D V B,5
teacher:The,5
teacher:How did you get your answer there,5
teacher:What did you do;student:I used a theorem,5
teacher:How about Leah tell me what you did cause it just I was on a whole nother different,5
teacher:How would you get that one,5
teacher:You say,5
teacher:But it  is Monday and Im wondering if you could think really hard and  sort of help me and try to help us remember what we were doing  on Friday morning,5
teacher:Who  wants to tell our visitor what happened,5
teacher:Graham your hand was  up first do you want to tell our visitor what happened,5
teacher:Okay can someone tell us how that story end;student:And then We had  to make a problem and use our rods to see who got more and by  how much,5
teacher:Who got  more and who got how much,5
teacher:Who wants to tell us the rest of that  story,5
teacher:But do you remember how you did it,5
teacher:Do you  remember how you were able to show that they got more by five  thirtysixths,5
teacher:Does anyone want to kind of  review how you showed that one  fourth was larger than one ninth by five thirtysixths,5
teacher:Can you kind of remember it in your head without the rods  how that worked James,5
teacher:Im kind of curious what made you think one fifth;student:Umhum,5
teacher:What do you think Meredith,5
teacher:How about U S V,5
teacher:Margaret go for it,5
teacher:Tell me what you just did again,5
teacher:Show explain that to me again,5
teacher:How though;student:I just used that theorem,5
teacher:How did you use it,5
teacher:You want to go write that up there for me,5
teacher:What are you gonna do first,5
teacher:Which one are you gonna work on first,5
teacher:What can you do for that;student:Yes,5
teacher:Raul what are you doing over here,5
teacher:Where do you think they could have gotten the 100 degrees if youre looking at that circle,5
teacher:Which angle are you doing first;student:Well I dont have any,5
teacher:Anybody want to tell me what you did,5
teacher:What did you do,5
teacher:So it has to be;student:Yeah,5
teacher:What did you come up with,5
teacher:So what are you gonna do with that,5
teacher:What did we just come up with for this one,5
teacher:U S V U S V How did you get that one Leah,5
teacher:Howd you get this one Melissa,5
teacher:How about A V C,5
teacher:So how about angle two,5
teacher:Where do you think they got that,5
teacher:Now since were doing division what does the rules of exponents say,5
teacher:What do we do about division rules,5
teacher:What do we know about division rules,5
teacher:What whats whats one of the rules,5
teacher:So how am I going to what am I gonna put down here such that this would be zero when Im done;student:Yes,5
teacher:By your rules what do you do,5
teacher:Now what do you know about math when a number is over itself,5
teacher:And what does it equal;student:They cancel out,5
teacher:What does A divided by A equal,5
teacher:So now if we do this division what answer do we have here,5
teacher:And whats that equal to;student:One,5
teacher:What does that say,5
teacher:And what is that equal to;student:A to the zero,5
teacher:Tell me what what it is,5
teacher:In your own words how would you describe that one,5
teacher:By one or by;student:One,5
teacher:divided by what;student:Minus it,5
teacher:What kind of problem could you give me,5
teacher:Look at your rules of exponents up there and where do you think you can get a negative N,5
teacher:What is our answer Robert,5
teacher:How could you prove something is equal to one;student:MAB,5
teacher:What do we know about the rule of one,5
teacher:What if A was a million,5
teacher:How,5
teacher:What does it mean,5
teacher:How can I get something to the zero power;student:Yeah but why,5
teacher:How about right angle corollary,5
teacher:What types of things can we do,5
teacher:Cause whats two to the one power,5
teacher:Whats two to the second power,5
teacher:And how did you do that,5
teacher:What if A was equal to 1000,5
teacher:No cause a thousand to the zero power is;student:Then itd be A to I dont know,5
teacher:What can I do mathematically to get A to zero power,5
teacher:Well how would you get a negative N up there looking at your rules of exponents;student:Maybe you divide it by one or something so that would be,5
teacher:Using your rules up there,5
teacher:You said if you took the blue and what number name are you  giving that;student:Well if you put the blue which has nine ones in it and the four  plus the five rod then you have nine,5
teacher:If it intercepts a semicircle then angle turns out to be,5
teacher:When they intercept the same arc then they have the same,5
teacher:How do you get that one,5
teacher:Triangle um;student:Um the triangle,5
teacher:Equal 180 so,5
teacher:How about P V C,5
teacher:Anything different about that one than the other example,5
teacher:If youre following a pattern what are you getting,5
teacher:Its gonna be;student:Half,5
teacher:For measure of angle A V C how would you relate that back to X for any for any measure,5
teacher:How would you figure out angle one if you know X for A X V,5
teacher:And Katie how would you do that last one that angle two,5
teacher:So tell me what to do and well try to put it in X for you;student:Like I,5
teacher:It could be a chord and a tangent youre gonna come up with what,5
teacher:If you have an angle that intersects with a secant and a tangent all in the circle;student:Nine,5
teacher:Its always gonna come up to be,5
teacher:How about where did they get measure of angle one do you think,5
teacher:How do you think they got that,5
teacher:Which is;student:Half of the arc,5
teacher:And so the last here this angle is going to be what,5
teacher:Thats going to be,5
teacher:What do you think the measure of A V C angle A V C is,5
teacher:Whatd you come up with,5
teacher:So and the measure of a semicircle here arc A V is what,5
teacher:So what can you get from that,5
teacher:If the whole arc is 180 and the angle is 90 what does that kind of remind you of,5
teacher:What happens if the angles acute,5
teacher:How do you know that,5
teacher:And arc intercept corollary Margaret,5
teacher:Where do they come up with that one,5
teacher:How would you get that one,5
teacher:This kind of this being 60 degrees how does that relate to back here the arc,5
teacher:So the measure of an acute secant tangent angle with its vertex on the circle is,5
teacher:What do you think this general statement here measure of arc A V if its X whats angle one gonna be,5
teacher:What about the measure of angle two,5
teacher:Michaela describe that for us,5
teacher:How about P V C,5
teacher:So where do we come up with this one,5
teacher:Well whats one times one times one;student:One,5
teacher:Youre going to give it nine and what was the other rod;student:Well Id call it nine,5
teacher:How did you do that;student:Well what I did one day we had to do for homework that we had  to divide equally so I came up with the answer that everyone got  one and one fifth,5
teacher:So place the number one third on that number line;student:or you could mark it here,5
teacher:Im asking you  then how where then would I mark two thirds,5
teacher:Where would I put two thirds,5
teacher:Where would you put three thirds,5
teacher:Danielle you want to come put three thirds somewhere,5
teacher:Where would you put zero thirds,5
teacher:How do I mark my ruler;student:They are the same length but you could take three more  of these,5
teacher:So what would I mark where the one inch ended;student:and you add another inch on there it would be three  inches,5
teacher:What  number would I put here if I were making a number line or ruler,5
teacher:Can you tell me who you agree with,5
teacher:Robbie,5
teacher:Or his friend,5
teacher:So is Robbie correct or his friend,5
teacher:Can you prove it;student:I feel like this one cause like I agree with Robbie because,5
teacher:Can you show it in a picture,5
teacher:How are you comparing the places  where you put the second one third and the two thirds,5
teacher:And who do you think,5
teacher:Where would you put two thirds;student:The second place for that one third would be somewhere  up here approximately,5
teacher:Where do you think  it will be,5
teacher:Where do you think it would go,5
teacher:Think about it for  a minute and tell me where you think it would go,5
teacher:One tenth,5
teacher:What  do you think,5
teacher:Any ideas,5
teacher:Then where would one tenthousandths be;student:On top of it Like one onehundredths and one one thousands well like one onehundredth would be  right there and   One thousandths would be right on  the zero,5
teacher:How does that work;student:Yeah I did it on both sides,5
teacher:How many times did you have to count;student:What I thought was that I was trying to estimate  count all the way up to one half because,5
teacher:What do you think if you were going from zero to  one tenth how many times would you have to count  to place one hundredth;student:So you would have to imagine  the length,5
teacher:Where would I put two,5
teacher:You know where I would put two,5
teacher:Where would you put three;student:Over there,5
teacher:Do you know where you would put four and five;student:Further over,5
teacher:Where would you put a  thousand,5
teacher:Where would a thousand be on that number  line,5
teacher:So where would a second place for that  one third be,5
teacher:Who do you agree with,5
teacher:And what is he trying to find out;student:Because its 12 which is 3 inches 3 inches,5
teacher:Okay so who do you agree with;student:Yeah,5
teacher:And then what is his friend thinking,5
teacher:Whats his friend thinking;student:Yeah,5
teacher:And the question I forgot to ask you in the very first poster that we did is How do we measure area,5
teacher:How do we measure it,5
teacher:Like if somebody wants to calculate the area of a shape how do you  how do you measure it,5
teacher:But how would you measure it,5
teacher:Like if I took this room and I wanted to  or this desk and I wanted to measure the area,5
teacher:What would I be doing,5
teacher:Other than just multiplying the length and the width,5
teacher:Okay so you would find out what the length and what the width is;student:Finding out what is the length and what is the width,5
teacher:And then what would you do,5
teacher:Can you talk with your partner and see what this student did,5
teacher:What did that student do,5
teacher:So whats inside,5
teacher:Whats actually inside that square,5
teacher:So now who do you agree with,5
teacher:What does that mean,5
teacher:So what does that mean,5
teacher:Is there any way to show that in the picture,5
teacher:And can you prove it;student:Robbie,5
teacher:How can you show me in the picture,5
teacher:How could you prove it in the picture,5
teacher:Jason do you have any idea;student:Um  I dont know,5
teacher:How could you prove it in a picture,5
teacher:Do you know who you agree with,5
teacher:So you agree with Robbie,5
teacher:Suppose I asked you to put one tenth up there,5
teacher:Could you show me in the picture,5
teacher:Can you prove it in the picture,5
teacher:So why dont you explain what you did;student:Is it,5
teacher:Gave you the area but can you prove it in the picture;student:Um to the,5
teacher:Which part of the picture is the area,5
teacher:Oh so the   which part of the picture;student:The length times width,5
teacher:So can you show me the 9 inches squared,5
teacher:Can you actually show me that in the picture,5
teacher:If you think his area is 9 inches squared can you prove it in your picture,5
teacher:What about the one fifth,5
teacher:You want to call on Andrew to put in the one  quarter;student:So its not its  just approximate cause I dont think,5
teacher:Dont go away Erik whats the next question,5
teacher:What about the one fifth,5
teacher:Where do you  think it would go,5
teacher:Think about it for a minute and tell me where  you think it would go,5
teacher:What  do you think,5
teacher:Any ideas,5
teacher:Ok Im going to ask you all one onehundredth What do you  think,5
teacher:What do you think;student:Now up there if you took that little space between the zero and the  one fifth and you  use that five times it wouldnt reach the half  way mark,5
teacher:I got the feeling that the second one you were showing halves and the third  number line what were you trying to show,5
teacher:And the fourth one;student:Thirds,5
teacher:The fifth one;student:Fourths,5
teacher:OK it represents one third How do you know that;student:It represent one third,5
teacher:Could you show me what represents two thirds what part of that line represents  two thirds;student:It would be the two thirds the segment but it would  be only one segment,5
teacher:Okay so where would you put three over three where would you write that  number if you were to write it on the number line;student:Alg,5
teacher:I see over here the  numbers zero  one third two thirds and one  Where would you put three thirds,5
teacher:And what makes three thirds;student:But together they make twothirds,5
teacher:So where do you put one third and one fourth,5
teacher:What do you think the next question will be,5
teacher:Do you Want to mark onehalf underneath where I put the zero and  the one,5
teacher:I wonder who would like to come up here and mark  where the number one half would be,5
teacher:Could you draw us a picture or something to show us  your way,5
teacher:Andrew how did you show that,5
teacher:Okay so everyone gets one of those thirty pieces and there are how  many left over;student:Then I took two candy bars and five pieces of the other one to  make twenty five,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:Is one and one fifth more or less than one and a quarter,5
teacher:More or  less,5
teacher:What do you think,5
teacher:On the first  number line you wrote up there could you place the fractions zero  one third  two thirds and three thirds,5
teacher:Is one and one fifth more or less than one and a quarter,5
teacher:One and one fifth more or less,5
teacher:Which is the bigger number;student:Because thats  a bigger number so when you have a bigger  number you get less,5
teacher:David what do you think,5
teacher:Want to come draw that for me;student:Well I think  that like if you have about this big then one half  would be right in the middle then  one third that would be kind of smaller  because you have to fit three pieces in there  and then one fourth would be even smaller than onethird,5
teacher:Can you mark one half right where you put it like put it right  underneath so we can see it;student:Umm like If this is the one here,5
teacher:Where do  you think one fifth would be Meredith,5
teacher:So do you think it would be to the right of a quarter or to the left of  a quarter;student:The whole would be divided into fifths,5
teacher:Those of you in the group with one and  a  quarter now got one and one fifth would you have gotten more or  less,5
teacher:Think about a way think about that  Andrew any ideas,5
teacher:What about zero,5
teacher:You can talk to  your partner if you want too but I would like you all to think about where you  would place one,5
teacher:I am kind of  curious where she would do that,5
teacher:I hope you will straighten me out because I am so  confused,5
teacher:Could someone tell me what the confusion is;student:one half could be  between,5
teacher:Are we going to leave it there or take that one half off,5
teacher:Want to come draw that for me;student:Then one fourth would be  even smaller than one third,5
teacher:Want to draw your one,5
teacher:Call something one and  zero draw it,5
teacher:Just draw the number one half where you want to  show one half;student:What do you mean,5
teacher:Then one fifth;student:And then like one fourth,5
teacher:Where do you think one fifth would be Meredith,5
teacher:So do you think it would be to the right of a quarter  or to the left of a quarter;student:The whole would be divided into fifths,5
teacher:I wonder who wants to   come up here and mark where the number one half  would be,5
teacher:Do you want to mark the number underneath,5
teacher:What do you think the next question Im going to  ask you,5
teacher:So where do you put one third;student:Where would you put one third,5
teacher:and negative four fourths,5
teacher:Negative three fourths,5
teacher:Negative  two fourths,5
teacher:Im kind of curious where Meredith would put negative one fourth;student:When adding up all those numbers on the negative side would just be like doing  nothing,5
teacher:By the way   if you have worked that one out I am curious where you would  put fourfourths,5
teacher:Where would you put fourfourths Erik and Michael,5
teacher:Where would you put five fifths,5
teacher:Sevensevenths,5
teacher:A millionmillionths,5
teacher:Where would you place the threethirds,5
teacher:So Jessica how could they do it to put it by  the one,5
teacher:I would like someone to tell me where you would place one;student:Zero would be put here,5
teacher:You want to go show them how to do it,5
teacher:Where would you put it,5
teacher:Let us hear what Graham thinks;student:I dont think so because its at the end,5
teacher:Where would you put the one half  Graham;student:Well she might have thought the ones before the zero like the three two one  were not negative,5
teacher:Where does it end;student:No,5
teacher:Where does it end on the other side;student:Infinity,5
teacher:I would like to know where I would put  negative one half,5
teacher:Where would you put threequarters;student:Because one and one and one half and one half is three,5
teacher:What do you think we  are going to do now,5
teacher:What do you see,5
teacher:If I had three of those what would I have;student:One,5
teacher:Whats A What Whats Whats A over A;student:Cause theyre both,5
teacher:Andrea how about the next row,5
teacher:Tim next row,5
teacher:And Jen how about the last row,5
teacher:Which one is greater,5
teacher:What does a Boa Constrictor order at the ice cream shop,5
